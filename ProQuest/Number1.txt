Abstract: Intervening in domestic violence in the health care and social service settings is a complex and contested issue. In this qualitative, multidisciplinary study, the barriers to but also the possibilities for health care professionals in encountering victims of violence were scrutinised. The focus was on omissions in service structure and practices. The data consisted of six focus group interviews with nurses, physicians, social workers and psychologists in specialist health care (n=30) conducted in Finland in 2009. The aim was to explore professionals' processes of making sense of violence interventions and the organisational practices of violence interventions. Four types of framing of the domestic violence issue were identified: (i) practical frame, (ii) medical frame, (iii) individualistic frame and (iv) psychological frame. Each frame consisted of particular features relating to explaining, structuring or dismissing the question of domestic violence in health care settings. The main themes included the division of responsibilities and feasibility of treatment. All four frames underlie the tendency for healthcare professionals to arrive at sense-making practices where it is possible to focus on fixing the injuries and consequences of domestic violence and bypassing the issue of violence as the cause of symptoms and injuries. The results indicate that developing successful practices both in identifying survivors of domestic violence and in preventing further victimisation requires a broad understanding of the effects of domestic violence and the challenges for health care professionals in dealing with it. New perspectives are needed in creating adequate practices both for victims of violence seeking help and for professionals working with this issue. Strong support at the organisational level and established practices throughout the fields of health and social care are the key elements in building a responsible approach to domestic violence.

Community Responses To Domestic Violence In China: Implications To Prevention And Intervention Work

Author: Tam, Dora M.Y.1; Dawson, Myrna; Jackson, Margret; Kwok, Siu-Ming; Thurston, Wilfreda E1 School of Social Work, King's University College, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada, N6A 2M3 dmytam@uwo.ca

Abstract: Domestic violence in marital relationships is against the law in the People's Republic of China (hereafter "China" is used), where progressive development to address domestic violence began after the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. In this article, domestic violence is referred to as violence against women by their male partners and the complexity of domestic violence is seen to be influenced by socio-cultural, economic, psychological, and environmental factors. Community responses to domestic violence are largely led by the "residents' committees" under the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the All Women's Federation in China. However, literature has documented the inadequacy of these community responses to prevent and intervene on domestic violence. A feminist perspective is used to examine the prevalence and perception of domestic violence in the local context, and discusses implications for prevention and intervention work in China. Adapted from the source document.

South Asian Women in the U.S. and their Experience of Domestic Violence

Author: Mahapatra, Neely11 Division of Social Work, University of Wyoming, Department 3632, 1000 E. University Avenue, Laramie, WY, 82071, USA nmahapat@uwyo.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283640806?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the extent of domestic violence and sociocultural factors (isolation, social support, acculturation, and patriarchy) associated with domestic violence among a community sample of 215 women of South Asian origin in the U.S. The sample is the largest to date in a study of domestic violence among South Asian women. Both paper and Web surveys were used. Of the sample, 38% experienced some form of abuse in the past year. Isolation from spouse/partner and perceived social support predicted abuse. This information is vital in developing effective and culturally appropriate intervention methods for South Asian women victims of domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

Prevalence and Determinants of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Marivan County, Iran

Author: Nouri, Roonama1; Nadrian, Haidar; Yari, Arezoo; Bakri, Gona; Ansari, Bahjat; Ghazizadeh, Ahmad1 School of Health, Hamedan University of Medical Sciences, Hamedan, Iran, Nadrian@razi.tums.ac.ir

Abstract: This paper reports on the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) as well as individual, socioeconomic, and family function characteristics associated with IPV among women attending public health services in Marivan County, Iran. Multistage cluster sampling was employed to recruit 770 women to participate in the study. This descriptive, cross-sectional study took place from May to November 2009. The majority of the women (79.7 %) had experienced psychological IPV, followed by physical IPV (60 %) and sexual IPV (32.9 %). There was a positive significant relationship between IPV and education level of women and the level of religious commitment in both women and spouses. Spouse's smoking, addiction to drugs, mental illness, and weakness in religious persuasion were statistically significant predictors of IPV and accounted for 36 % of the variation. This correlational study suggests that educational programs regarding these risk factors and their associations with the outcome of IPV should be designed by healthcare providers and implemented not only in healthcare facilities, but presented from local media. Public health services and healthcare facilities can play an important role in the detection of IPV and improve responses to victims by establishing education centers and informing women of the best ways they can confront this deleterious problem.

Intimate Partner Abuse among African American Lesbians: Prevalence, Risk Factors, Theory, and Resilience

Author: Hill, Nicholle A1; Woodson, Kamilah M; Ferguson, Angela D; Parks, Carlton W1 Department of Human Development and Psychoeducational Studies, Counseling Psychology Program, Howard University, Washington, DC, USA nicholle.hill@yahoo.com

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to present an intersectionality-based model for conceptualizing the risk factors associated with intimate partner abuse (IPA) among African American lesbians. The available literature on prevalence and risk factors associated with IPA suggests that: (a) estimates of prevalence rates for African American lesbian IPA could range from 25% to 40%, with the higher end of the range representing the inclusion of nonphysical forms of abuse (i.e., verbal abuse, intimidation, and coercion); and (b) the risk factors most likely to be associated with IPA for this population include poverty, history of trauma and mental health symptoms (including substance abuse), in addition to distress caused by multiple and intersecting forms of oppression (i.e., racialized, classist sexism and heterosexism). The model demonstrates the manner in which all of these risk factors intersect to create disproportionately high risk for this underresearched and underserved population. A psychodynamically based model is also presented that illustrates the cycle of abuse within an African American lesbian relationship. Finally, a model depicting the most likely protective factors segues into a brief concluding discussion about the implications for intervention, prevention, policy, education, and future research. Adapted from the source document.

Battering Men and Their Male Therapists: The Different and the Similar

Author: Bailey, Benjamin1; Eisikovits, Zvi; Buchbinder, Eli1 School of Social Work, Center for the Study of Society, University of Haifa, Haifa, 31905, Israel bailey@soc.haifa.ac.il

Abstract: This paper describes the process of change in attitudes of male social workers' towards themselves and towards their clients who are male perpetrators of partner violence (PV). The process reveals a reconstruction of the therapist's beliefs concerning key elements in their work related being, such as masculinity, aggression, perception of their clients and their own male identities. The sample includes 15 male social workers that worked with battering men in social services. Data collection was performed through semi-structured interviews. The therapists' process of questioning the popular and accepted demonization of violent men clarifies what differentiates them from their clients, but also opens an authentic pathway to examining similarities they share as men, without the need to be politically correct or to conform. The implications for practitioners working in batterers' intervention programs are addressed. Adapted from the source document.

Infants Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence: Issues of Gender and Sex

Author: Tailor, Ketan1; Letourneau, Nicole1 University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada, ketan.tailor@hotmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1223160438?accountid=14925

Abstract: A review of the literature finds that the development of infants exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) may vary across sex as boys display more externalizing behavior, while girls show more internalizing behavior. Given this trend, gender- and sex-based analysis (GSBA) may play a critical role in understanding and improving the adjustment of these infants. Researchers are often encouraged to include gender and sex into their analysis, though they are rarely afforded appropriate direction in this process. The intention of this article is to provide guidance in GSBA for research on infant development in families affected by IPV. We present a discussion on GSBA, a review of the literature, explanations for differences in male and female infant development, a set of research priorities, and directions for future work. Findings suggest that a better understanding of the complexities in the adjustment of violence-exposed infants through GSBA may promote childhood development.

Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Communities' Readiness for Intimate Partner Violence Prevention

Author: Turell, Susan1; Herrmann, Molly; Hollander, Gary; Galletly, Carol1 Clarion University, Clarion, Pennsylvania sturell@clarion.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347786271?accountid=14925

Abstract: Efforts to address intimate partner violence (IPV) in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities often rely on identifying what service providers can do to better reach and serve these populations. However, assessing a community's readiness in response to the issue of IPV in LGBT communities locates the issue where outcry is most likely to occur. Utilizing the Community Readiness Model in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities in two rural and two urban communities, this study revealed a low level of community readiness to address IPV. Only vague awareness of IPV exists in these sexual orientation, gender identity, and geographic communities. The study suggests specific next steps tailored to raise LGBT communities' readiness to address IPV from within their own communities, starting at the current low level.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine which factors derived from an adapted version of the Health Belief Model are associated with HIV testing among women at domestic violence shelters in the rural south (N = 112). Participants were administered self-report questionnaires to assess for test acceptance and were offered private and free HIV rapid testing. A logistic regression analysis was performed. Results indicated that higher perceived susceptibility and higher posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms predicted a greater likelihood of HIV test acceptance. The most common reason given for not testing was a lack of time. Implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Justification, Perception of Severity and Harm, and Criminalization of Wife Abuse in the Palestinian Society

Author: Haj-Yahia, Muhammad M1; Wilson, Rula M; Naqvi, Syed Agha M1 The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1125222932?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the perceptions of Palestinian adults toward different dimensions of wife abuse. A cross-sectional survey, using a combination of self-administered questionnaires and interviews, was conducted among a systematic random sample of 624 adult Palestinian men and women from the West Bank and Gaza Strip (18 years or older). Study results indicated a strong tendency to justify wife beating in different situations, such as when the wife is perceived as having an affair with another man or as physically attacking her husband. Participants considered the following acts of husband's violence against wife as most severe: using a weapon (86%), having sex with the wife against her will (67%), and hitting her with his fist (57%). The majority of participants thought that wife beating should be considered a crime (82.3%). Traditional marital role expectations was the main significant predictor for all of the study criterion variables. Gender, place of residence, age, and marital status were significant predictors of some of the criterion variables. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

The Development and Initial Validation of the Dating Attitudes Inventory: A Measure of the Gender Context of Dating Violence in Men

Author: Schwartz, Jonathan Peter1; Kelley, Frances A; Kohli, Nidhi1 New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1125220738?accountid=14925

Abstract: The development and initial psychometric investigation of the Dating Attitudes Inventory (DAI) is reported. The DAI was created, to fill a gap in the literature and to measure specific masculine ideology and traditional gender attitudes that rationalize the abuse of women. Using a sample (n = 164) of male college students, a 20-item measure was developed consisting of two subscales (Rationalization of Abuse and Dominance and Control) and a total score. The 20-item DAI and other measures used for validation were completed by 216 male college students. The DAI correlated in theoretically expected ways with measures of propensity for abusiveness, relational dominance, and masculine gender role stress. A confirmatory factor analysis supported the two theorized factors of the DAI. Results of the present study offer initial support for the validity and reliability of the DAI. The authors discuss the importance of measuring masculine gender role attitudes and beliefs that support and rationalize dating violence.

Association Between Education and Domestic Violence Among Women Being Offered an HIV Test in Urban and Rural Areas in Kenya

Author: Abuya, Benta A1; Onsomu, Elijah O; Moore, DaKysha; Piper, Crystal N1 African Population and Health Research Center, Nairobi, Kenya

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1125222979?accountid=14925

Abstract: The objective of this study was to examine the association between education and domestic violence among women being offered an HIV test in urban and rural areas in Kenya. A sample selection of women who experienced physical (n = 4,308), sexual (n = 4,309), and emotional violence (n = 4,312) aged 15 to 49 allowed for the estimation of the association between education and domestic violence with further analysis stratified by urban and rural residence. The main outcome of interest was a three-factor (physical, sexual, and emotional) measure for violence with the main predictor being education. Nearly half of all domestic violence, physical (46%), sexual (45%), and emotional (45%) occurred among women aged 15 to 29. After adjusting for confounding variables, women who resided in urban areas and had a postprimary/vocational/secondary and college/university education were 26% (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: [0.64, 0.86]), p < .001 and 22% (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: [0.66, 0.92]), p < .01 less likely to have experienced physical violence compared to those who had a primary education respectively. This was 17% (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: [0.73, 0.94]), p < .01 and 17% (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: [0.72, 0.96]), p < .05 less likely among women who resided in rural areas. A surprising finding was that women residing in rural areas with less than a primary education were 35% less likely to have experienced sexual violence (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: [0.43, 0.99]), p < .01 compared to those who had a primary education. These findings suggest that physical, sexual, and emotional violence were prevalent in Kenya among married and formerly married women. This study indicates that more research is needed to understand factors for HIV/AIDS among Kenyan women who have specifically tested positive for HIV or identified as AIDS-positive and the implications for women's health.

Relationships Among Alcohol Outlet Density, Alcohol use, and Intimate Partner Violence Victimization Among Young Women in the United States

Author: Waller, Martha W1; Iritani, Bonita J; Christ, Sharon L; Clark, Heddy Kovach; Moracco, Kathryn E; Halpern, Carolyn Tucker; Flewelling, Robert L1 Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, Chapel Hill, NC, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1125220813?accountid=14925

Abstract: Greater access to alcohol has been widely found to be associated with many negative outcomes including violence perpetration. This study examines the relationship between alcohol outlet density, alcohol use, and intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization among young women in the United States. A direct association between alcohol outlet density in one's neighborhood and the likelihood of IPV victimization was examined. Data were from Wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), which followed a nationally representative sample of adolescents into adulthood. Participants were young adult females age 18 to 26 at Wave III. Of the 4,571 female respondents who reported a current heterosexual relationship and had IPV data, 13.2% reported having been the victim of physical violence only and 6.5% experienced sexual only or physical and sexual violence in the relationship during the past year. In the regression models tested, there was no significant direct association between neighborhood alcohol outlet density and IPV victimization nor was there an association between outlet density and drinking behaviors, thus eliminating the possibility of an indirect association. Results of fully adjusted models indicate females who drank heavily, whether infrequently or frequently, were at significant risk for experiencing sexual only IPV or sexual and physical IPV. Asians and Native Americans were at significantly greater odds of experiencing sexual only or sexual and physical IPV compared with non-Hispanic Whites, while non-Hispanic Blacks were at significantly greater odds for physical only IPV. We conclude that a continuous measure of alcohol outlet density was not associated with IPV in models controlling for individual and other neighborhood characteristics. Young women who drink heavily, whether infrequently or frequently, have greater odds of experiencing sexual only or sexual and physical compared to abstainers. Similar to previous study findings, young women living with or married to their partner were at far greater risk of experiencing physical only and/or sexual only or sexual and physical IPV. The study adds to the growing body of literature that examines how community characteristics such as outlet density influence the likelihood of IPV.

Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Police-Reported Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration: A Mixed Methods Approach

Author: Lipsky, Sherry1; Cristofalo, Meg; Reed, Sarah; Caetano, Raul; Roy-Byrne, Peter1 School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington at Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA

Abstract: The objectives of this study were to examine racial and ethnic disparities in perpetrator and incident characteristics and discrepancies between police charges and reported perpetrator behaviors in police-reported intimate partner violence (IPV). This cross-sectional study used standardized police data and victim narratives of IPV incidents reported to the police in Dallas, Texas in 2004. The sample included non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic male perpetrators who were residents of Dallas (N = 4470). Offense charges were prioritized in descending order: sexual assault, aggravated assault, simple assault, kidnapping, robbery, and intimidation. Textual data from the victim narratives were coded, based on the revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS), and categorized in descending order of priority: sexual (severe, minor), physical (severe, minor), and psychological (severe, minor) assault. Perpetrators were more likely to be Black and Hispanic. Perpetrator and incident characteristics varied significantly by race/ethnicity, particularly age, age difference between partners, marital status, injury, and interracial relationships. Qualitative data revealed that greater proportions of Black and Hispanic men perpetrated severe physical, but not sexual violence, compared with White men. The greatest disparity between CTS categories and police charges occurred among those cases identified by the CTS as severe physical IPV; 84% were charged with simple assault. Significant differences by race/ethnicity were found only for simple assault charges, which were coded as severe physical as opposed to minor physical IPV more often among Black (69% and 31%) compared with White (62% and 38%) men. The disparities revealed in this study highlight the need to enhance primary and secondary prevention efforts within Black and Hispanic communities and to increase linkages between police, community, and public health organizations.

Abstract: This article examines women's movements as agents of change in postcommunist Croatia and Slovenia: whether, and in what ways, they may have succeeded in politicizing and institutionalizing the issue of domestic violence in the two countries. Theoretically, this article aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion of the effectiveness of different forms of women's policy agency. Using a policy process analysis, the study demonstrates the key role women's movements have played in putting the issue of domestic violence on the political agenda and pressuring governments to enact new legislation. The findings challenge the common assumption that Central and Eastern European women's movements have remained weak, antifeminist, and apolitical, exerting only marginal influence on the gender policy processes in the region. Adapted from the source document.

From affront to melodrama: family, violence and crime in the last works of Carlos Fuentes

Author: Boldy, Steven11 Modern and Medieval Languages, Cambridge University and a PhD there in 1978

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1266146043?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the context of the last work of Carlos Fuentes (La frontera de cristal, 1995; La Silla del Aguila, 2002; Todas las familias felices, 2006; La voluntad y la fortuna, 2008 and Adan en Eden, 2009) this article traces a shift in aesthetics and content from the models established in his earlier production. The dialectic between idealism and opportunism and the role of tragic consciousness and irony give way to a pessimistic concern about degeneration in the social and political life of Mexico, expressed in an apocalyptic, melodramatic and grotesque prose. The process is analyzed mainly in family relations, especially in the dynasties founded by Barroso and Monroy. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence In India: Cases Under The Protection Of Women From Domestic Violence Act, 2005

Author: Bhatia, Manjeet11 Women's Studies & Development Centre, University of Delhi, Delhi, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283642063?accountid=14925

Abstract: After prolonged lobbying, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act of 2005 was implemented in India in October 2006. The Act soon gave rise to cases. This article is based on a preliminary study using questionnaire-based interviews of litigants in Delhi who were involved in cases under the Act. Primary data, taken from all the Delhi Metropolitan Magistrates Courts at that time, concern the background of those who used the law, the litigation process, implementation of the law and the forms of violence addressed. The article seeks to assess the effectiveness of this new legislation and examines specifically what kinds of people bring actions under this new gender-specific law. In addition, qualitative assessment of the perceptions of different kinds of violence by complainants and respondents provides deeper insights into ongoing and potential contestations over gender-based violence.

Domestic Violence within the Irish Travelling Community: The Challenge for Social Work

Author: Allen, Mary11 Lecturer in Social Work, UCD mary.allen@ucd.ie

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283641060?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence against women is an international social problem that social workers encounter on a daily basis. While prevalence figures vary around the world, it is sometimes believed that women in some ethnic minority communities are more likely to experience this form of violence. One of the communities about which this is a perception is the travelling community in Ireland. This paper explores the experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) within this ethnic minority community. Using a mixed-method approach that sought the views of both traveller women and a range of Irish service providers, the complex interaction of culture, racism and discrimination on women experiencing abuse is explored. The impact of these factors on traveller women's ability to leave a violent relationship is discussed and the implications for social work practice are outlined. While social workers need to fully comprehend the dynamics and complexities of such forms of abuse, the particular needs of women in ethnic groups such as the traveller community need to be understood and appreciated when interventions are being planned and implemented. The paper discusses the role of the MSLC social work model of working with IPV in minority ethnic communities. Adapted from the source document.

Public Justification of Intimate Partner Violence: A Review of the Literature

Author: Waltermaurer, Eve11 Department of Sociology, State University of New York, New Paltz, NY, USA walterme@newpaltz.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1030869715?accountid=14925

Abstract: Understanding the extent to which the general public justifies intimate partner violence (IPV) is necessarily to explain perpetration, victimization, and response to this behavior. This article provides a literature review of quantitative studies measuring IPV justification among the general population. Key word searching of two databases plus bibliographies, and the web yielded 23 studies that provided comparable measures of IPV justification. Results are summarized for the prevalence of IPV justification identified for each country including differences in justification based on the initiating event (e.g., burning food and infidelity), sociodemographic differences in justification and differences across countries. No study identified a zero prevalence of IPV justification and percentages varied considerably across and within countries. Females tended to report a higher rate of IPV justification than males and younger respondents tended to report a higher rate IPV justification than their older counterparts. Further research is needed to understand IPV justification within and across nations as well as to explore the impact this has on IPV prevalence and policy.

"There's So Much at Stake": Sexual Minority Youth Discuss Dating Violence

Author: Gillum, Tameka L1; DiFulvio, Gloria1 University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704442?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to explore perceptions of dating violence among a sample of sexual minority youth. Focus groups were conducted as part of a larger study that surveyed 109 sexual minority youth between the ages of 18 and 24 years. Participants identified four main themes contributing to dating violence among same-sex couples: homophobia (societal and internalized); negotiating socially prescribed gender roles; assumed female connection; and other relationship issues. Such information is essential for determining the need for and content of dating violence services, including education, safety planning, and referrals for mental and physical health services for sexual minority youth.

Domestic Violence, Culture, and Relationship Dynamics Among Immigrant Mexican Women

Author: Fuchsel, Catherine L. Marrs1; Murphy, Sharon B; Dufresne, Rebecca1 School of Social Work, St. Catherine University and the University of St. Thomas, St. Paul, MN, USA clmarrsfuchsel@stkate.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283641293?accountid=14925

Abstract: Immigrant Mexican women experience domestic violence, yet little is known about the cultural dynamics of their living with domestic violence. The authors conducted qualitative exploratory, in-depth interviews using grounded theory to examine domestic violence among nine immigrant Mexican women who were residing in a southwestern city. Dating patterns; parental influence; cultural concepts, such as familism and machismo; and trying to keep the family together were subcategories that emerged in the data that led to three socially and culturally relevant hypotheses for preventing domestic violence for immigrant Mexican women. Social workers can use the findings to gain a better understanding of how to serve immigrant Mexican women who experience domestic violence.

An overview of the legal and cultural issues for migrant Muslim women of the European Union: A focus on domestic violence and Italy

Author: Bucci, Linda11 Lasell College, Newton, MA, USA lbucci@lasell.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1315600036?accountid=14925

Abstract: The migration of Muslims into European nations and the intolerance exhibited towards them has been a growing challenge for the members of the European Union. The differences between the religion and cultures from which the Muslim women migrate and the receiving countries of the European Union may hamper the provision of social services to them when they experience domestic violence from their intimate partners. This article examines the potential for cross-cultural misunderstanding by examining domestic abuse in Italy in the context of both the social mores and the legal framework of that country. A comparison is made to the traditional perception of the role of women in Islamic culture. The research available on domestic violence in this context is examined as it relates to Italy and its Muslim migrants. The article suggests that what is needed are multidisciplinary cross-cultural solutions to provide services and meet the needs of Muslim victims of domestic violence in Italy. Adapted from the source document.

Inconsistencies in Mothers' and Group Therapists' Evaluations of Resilience in Preschool Children who Live in Households with Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Howell, Kathryn H1; Miller, Laura E; Graham-Bermann, Sandra A1 Department of Psychiatry, Child and Adolescent Section, University of Michigan Health System, Rachel Upjohn Building, 4250 Plymouth Road, SPC 5766, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-5766, USA, howellkh@med.umich.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1433670294?accountid=14925

Abstract: The association between mother-reported child adjustment problems and group therapists' ratings of resilience was evaluated in preschool-aged children who reside in homes where intimate partner violence (IPV) is present. Multiple reporters' evaluations of resilience were assessed to determine how young children display resilience at home and in treatment. Reporters were mothers and child therapists who evaluated resilience in 52 preschoolers who lived in households where IPV occurs. Group therapists' ratings of resilience were negatively correlated with children's externalizing behavior problems. Findings indicated poor rater agreement between mothers and group therapists on some aspects of resilience. Evaluations differed based on demographic factors, with the most variability in resilience by child age. Given the lack of research on this topic and the common practice of only one informant supplying most of the data used in studies of child functioning, the current study provides unique information by comparing multiple reports across settings.

Physical Health in Preschool Children Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence

Abstract: Exposure to violence and traumatic events during childhood has long been associated with poor physical and psychological health during adulthood. Very few studies, however, have taken steps to understand the immediate relationship between exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) and physical health problems in young children. In this study, we examined the mother-reported physical health problems of 102 preschool-age children who have been exposed to IPV. We found that children exhibiting more traumatic stress symptoms displayed fewer total health problems; however, gastrointestinal problems and asthma were related to poor psychological adjustment. We also found that preschool-age girls were more likely to display health problems than boys. Future studies of the physical health consequences of exposure to IPV in young children would benefit from examinations of specific changes in physiological processes to draw conclusions about the effects of violence on immune system functioning and physical health.

Correctional Officers and Domestic Violence: Experiences and Attitudes

Author: Valentine, Colby1; Oehme, Karen; Martin, Annelise1 College of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504421256?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents the first statewide data regarding correctional officers' attitudes about and personal experiences with domestic violence. Online surveys were administered to Florida correctional officers asking a series of questions, including their beliefs and attitudes about the prevalence of domestic violence among colleagues, and their childhood and adult experiences with domestic violence. Results from 710 officers revealed that 33 % of respondents knew about correctional officers who had committed unreported domestic violence; 30 % reported that they had directly experienced domestic violence as children; and over 11 % reported that they had been physically violent with an intimate partner. Multivariate statistics showed that age, race, and childhood experiences with domestic violence were significantly related to correctional officers reporting being physically abusive to an intimate partner or family member. These and other findings highlight the need for increased agency prevention efforts and research on the phenomenon of correctional officer-involved domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This study aimed to understand patterns of physical and psychological violence and the system of social support among female immigrants from the Former Soviet Union in Israel who are suffering from domestic violence. Immigrant women receiving help in Centers for the Treatment and Prevention of Domestic Violence and in shelters for battered women (n=74) were compared with Israeli-born women receiving help in the same Centers and shelters (n=107). Immigrant and Israeli-born women reported similar levels of physical and psychological violence, and the immigrants' utilization of formal and informal systems of social support was similar to that among Israeli-born women. However, immigrant women were threatened more frequently with expulsion from Israel, and their partners were alcoholically intoxicated more often than the partners of Israeli-born women. Non-Jewish women were more frequently threatened with expulsion from Israel, and they reported a lower level of social support received from parents and friends. Adapted from the source document.

The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Mothers' Parenting Practices for Urban, Low-Income Adolescents

Author: Murray, Kantahyanee W1; Bair-Merritt, Megan H; Roche, Kathleen; Cheng, Tina L1 Ruth H. Young Center for Families and Children, School of Social Work, University of Maryland Baltimore, 525 West Redwood Street, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA kmurray@ssw.umaryland.edu

Abstract: This study examined whether depression and social support mediated the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and parenting practices. Participants were 1,057 female primary caregiver-young adolescent pairs. (Sample included greater than 90 % biological mothers; hereafter, female primary caregivers are referred to as mother.) Findings indicated that IPV was associated positively with mothers' use of physical punishment and negatively with mothers' involvement in their children's education. Although depression and social support were not found to mediate the relationship between IPV and parenting practices, study findings suggest that IPV directly and negatively impacted mothers' parenting practices. In sum, findings point to the important role that IPV may play in explaining parenting practices for mothers living in high-risk urban environments. Adapted from the source document.

Mothers Affected by Domestic Violence: Intersections and Opportunities with the Justice System

Abstract: Secondary analysis from two qualitative studies was used to explore the interactions of mothers exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) with the justice system. Results were categorized according to three key themes: (a) negative interactions within the justice system, (b) positive interactions within the justice system, and (c) recommendations for an improved justice system response to domestic violence. Overall, findings suggested that mothers affected by domestic violence are confronted with negative attitudes and ineffectual practices within convoluted bureaucratic criminal justice systems, leaving many feeling revictimized. Despite the negative aspects of the legal system, women in both studies cited positive examples of feeling comforted, validated, and even empowered by the actions of the specific service providers. The findings of both studies underscore the need for greater efficiencies within the justice system and mandatory training for service providers, making it easier for women who have left their abusers to access appropriate support services, as well as the importance of affirmational support particularly when it can be provided by a peer with shared experiences. Future research is needed to guide the development of interventions that will limit the impacts of IPV exposure on child developmental outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

Nurse Home Visitors' Perceptions of Mandatory Reporting of Intimate Partner Violence to Law Enforcement Agencies

Author: Davidov, Danielle M1; Nadorff, Michael R; Jack, Susan M; Coben, Jeffrey H1 West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364701767?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the United States, there is an ongoing debate about requiring health care professionals to report intimate partner violence (IPV) to law enforcement agencies. A comprehensive examination of the perspectives of those required to report abuse is critical, as their roles as mandated reporters often pose legal, practical, moral, and ethical questions. Even so, the perspective of health care professionals who are required to report is often overlooked and research is scarce on mandated reporters who work outside of clinical settings, such as nurses who engage in home visitation with clients. The purpose of this study was to examine nurse home visitors' perspectives regarding the mandatory reporting of IPV, specifically focusing on their attitudes toward reporting, perceived awareness of reporting requirements, and intended reporting behaviors. A web-based survey was administered to nurses in the Nurse-Family Partnership home visitation program across the United States. A total of 532 completed surveys were returned (response rate = 49%). In terms of support for reporting IPV, 40% of nurses indicated that they should "always" be required to report. Almost half of the sample indicated that they would report a case of IPV, yet less than one-third of participants were aware of a legal mandate. Attitudes and support toward reporting as well as the perception of a reporting requirement significantly predicted intention to report. Furthermore, 29% of participants did not know if they were required to report IPV perpetrated against their clients. Comprehensive information about mandatory reporting duties is needed for health care professionals in home visitation settings. The findings of the current study highlight the need to reduce variation among practitioners and establish consistent program practices that are grounded in the program's principals, supported by existing research, and compliant with existing state policies.

Optimistic bias about dating/relationship violence among teens

Author: Chapin, John R1; Coleman, Grace1 Communications, Pennsylvania State University, Monaca, PA, 15061, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347781049?accountid=14925

Abstract: A survey of American adolescents documented optimistic bias regarding intimate partner violence (IPV). Teenagers believe they are less likely than peers to become victims of violence by a boyfriend or girlfriend, despite reporting some first-hand experience with violence. Optimistic bias was predicted by prior knowledge of dating and relationship violence and perceptions about media influence. The findings indicate that optimistic bias is more than an esteem-preserving mechanism and point to new directions in research by exploring linkages to cultivation effects. The study also extends the optimistic bias literature by utilizing an adolescent sample and exploring IPV as a context. Adapted from the source document.

Why women stay: A theoretical examination of rational choice and moral reasoning in the context of intimate partner violence

Abstract: Public attitudes towards intimate partner violence (IPV) have shifted from viewing IPV as a tolerable, private matter to viewing it as a matter of public concern that should be dealt with as a crime. Despite this major shift in social attitudes towards IPV over the last three decades, there seems to be a lack of understanding of why many women stay, at least initially, when facing severe forms of IPV. Using data from face-to-face interviews conducted with 29 women in Southeast Queensland who experienced severe forms of IPV over an extended period of time, this paper explores the rationale behind the (initial) decision to stay with an abusive partner. While rational decision making has predominantly been seen as a male trait, this paper criticizes this underlying assumption, using a feminist framework of moral reasoning. Findings presented in this paper identify the rationale behind victims' decisions to stay and offer an advanced understanding of moral reasoning through a gendered lens in the context of IPV. Understanding why women stay, at least initially, is the first crucial step in ensuring adequate support for women on their journey towards the ultimate goal of a violence-free life.

When punishment and philanthropy mix: Voluntary organizations and the governance of the domestic violence offender

Author: Singh, Rashmee11 University of Toronto, Canada and American Bar Foundation, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1221408028?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the administration of community based punishment in Toronto's specialized domestic violence courts. Voluntary organizations play an integral role in the Ontario government's strategy to manage domestic violence. Currently, an array of 'mainstream' and 'ethno-specific' community agencies operate as quasi-criminal justice organizations to rehabilitate and supervise court mandated offenders. Despite their categorization however, both types of organizations largely cater to the same demographics. The discussion explores the techniques of governance service providers deploy when counseling their clientele. The emergence of two differing regimes of power, one emphasizing care and the other discipline, along the mythological categories of the 'mainstream' and 'ethno-specific' illuminate the constitutive effects of organizational habits on the delivery of punishment.

The Impact of Victim-Focused Outreach on Criminal Legal System Outcomes Following Police-Reported Intimate Partner Abuse

Author: DePrince, Anne P1; Belknap, Joanne; Labus, Jennifer S; Buckingham, Susan E; Gover, Angela R1 University of Denver, Denver, CO, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1223040191?accountid=14925

Abstract: Randomized control designs have been used in the public health and psychological literatures to examine the relationship between victim outreach following intimate partner abuse (IPA) and various outcomes. These studies have largely relied on samples drawn from health providers and shelters to examine outcomes outside the criminal legal system. Based on the positive findings from this body of research, we expected that a victim-focused, community-coordinated outreach intervention would improve criminal legal system outcomes. The current study used a randomized, longitudinal design to recruit 236 ethnically diverse women with police-reported IPA to compare treatment-as-usual with an innovative community-coordinated, victim-focused outreach program. Findings indicated that the outreach program was effective in increasing women's engagement with prosecution tasks as well as likelihood of taking part in prosecution of their abusers. Results were particularly robust among women marginalized by ethnicity and class, and those still living with their abusers after the target incident.

Barriers to Screening for Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Sprague, Sheila1; Madden, Kim; Simunovic, Nicole; Godin, Katelyn; Pham, Ngan K; Bhandari, Mohit; Goslings, J C1 Department of Clinical Epidemiology & Biostatistics, and Department of Surgery, Division of Orthopaedic Surgery, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

Abstract: Background: Health care providers play a vital role in the detection of intimate partner violence among their patients. Despite the recommendations for routine intimate partner violence screening in various medical settings, health care providers do not routinely screen for intimate partner violence. The authors wanted to identify barriers to intimate partner violence screening and improve the understanding of intimate partner violence screening barriers among different health care providers. Methods: The authors conducted a systematic review to examine health care providers' perceived barriers to screening for intimate partner violence. By grouping the studies into two time periods, based on date of publication, they examined differences in the reported barriers to intimate partner violence screening over time. Results: The authors included a total of 22 studies in this review from all examined sources. Five categories of intimate partner violence screening barriers were identified: personal barriers, resource barriers, perceptions and attitudes, fears, and patient-related barriers. The most frequently reported barriers included personal discomfort with the issue, lack of knowledge, and time constraints. Provider-related barriers were reported more often than patient-related barriers. Conclusions: Barriers to screening for intimate partner violence are numerous among health care providers of various medical specialties. Increased education and training regarding intimate partner violence is necessary to address perceptions and attitudes to remove barriers that hinder intimate partner violence screening by health care providers.

Council-Based Approaches to Reforming the Health Care Response to Domestic Violence: Promising Findings and Cautionary Tales

Author: Allen, Nicole E1; Larsen, Sadie E; Javdani, Shabnam; Lehrner, Amy L1 Department of Psychology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 603 E. Daniel Street, Champaign, IL, 61820, USA, allenne@illinois.edu

Abstract: Councils are commonly formed to address social issues including intimate partner violence (IPV). Research suggests that councils may be well positioned to achieve proximal outcomes, but that their success may depend on contextual factors. The current study compared providers and health care settings at two points in time to explore the degree to which the Health Care Council achieved proximal outcomes in the health care response to IPV, including: (a) providers' reported capacity to screen for IPV, (b) providers' beliefs about IPV as a health care issue and about the IPV screening process, (c) providers' screening behaviors and (d) organizational policies and protocols to encourage screening. This study, while preliminary, provides support for council-based efforts to stimulate change in the health care response to IPV and also highlights the central role that organizational environment plays in shaping desired outcomes.

Challenges for dealing with cases of domestic violence against children and adolescents through the Family Health Program in a medium-sized city in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil

Author: Lobato, Georgia Rosa1; Moraes, Claudia Leite; do Nascimento, Marilene Cabral1 Instituto de Medicina Social, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524, 7 andar, blocos D e E Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20559-900, Brasil

Abstract: This qualitative case study aimed to analyze the challenges faced by the Family Health Program (FHP) teams in dealing with domestic violence against children and adolescents in Teresopolis, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The sample consisted of 25 professionals from three family health teams. Data were collected through face-to-face semi-structured thematic interviews and submitted to content analysis. Findings included the health professionals' detection of cases of domestic violence among families enrolled in the program, often associated with drug use and drug dealing, alcoholism, family breakdown, and poverty. Collaboration with the community and difficulty in inter-sector actions were identified as challenges for detecting, reporting, and monitoring cases. Most professionals felt insecure in dealing with such cases, due to lack of appropriate knowledge and skills. The study concludes that it is essential to managers, staff and community discuss the problem and means to approach it in the context of the territories. Adapted from the source document.

Applying generic sentencing aims in domestic violence cases in England and Wales

Author: Bettinson, Vanessa; Dingwall, Gavin

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448994107?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is an enduring legacy of trivialisation and ineffectiveness at various stages in the criminal justice process when it comes to responding to domestic violence. One area of contention relates to sentence. Sentencers in England and Wales are bound by law to have regard to a number of aims: the punishment of offenders; deterrence; public protection; rehabilitation; and reparation. Whilst commentators have criticised the framework on the basis that it is contradictory and engenders inconsistency, it will be argued that granting sentencers discretion to balance the prescribed aims maximises the potential for a successful outcome in individual cases.

Distress Resulting From Perceivers' Own Intimate Partner Violence Experiences Predicts Culpability Attributions Toward a Battered Woman on Trial for Killing Her Abuser: A Path Model

Author: Stein, Michelle L1; Miller, Audrey K1 Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, TX, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1222878002?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) constitutes the majority of assaults against women in the United States, and greater than one third of female homicide victims are murdered by an intimate partner. In a small percentage of cases, battered women kill their abusers, and evidence of battering and its effects may be used to support a plea of self-defense in these cases. Prior research has shown that culpability attributions toward battered women who have killed their abusers are influenced by perceiver variables, including gender. The present study expands on this research by examining the influence of psychological distress resulting from perceivers' own IPV experiences-and the mechanisms of this influence-on their culpability attributions toward a battered woman defendant. Female undergraduates in the present sample (N = 154) read a vignette, adapted from an actual criminal case about a battered woman who had killed her abuser. Data supported a hypothesized path model, wherein participants reporting greater psychological distress resulting from IPV perpetrated against them perceived themselves more similar to the defendant, in turn empathized with her to a greater extent, and, in turn, attributed less legal culpability to her. Implications for future research are discussed.

Intimate Partner Violence Against Older Women in Germany: Prevalence and Associated Factors

Author: Stockl, Heidi1; Watts, Charlotte; Penhale, Bridget1 London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705255?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence against women is a recognized human rights and public health issue, with significant impacts on women's life and health. Until now, several studies, most of them relying on small scale samples, have explored the prevalence and health effects of intimate partner violence against older women, whereas few have examined what actually puts older women at risk of intimate partner violence. This study is based on a secondary analysis of the first national survey on violence against women in Germany, looking at the prevalence and associated factors for physical and for sexual violence by the current partners of women aged 50 to 65 and women aged 66 to 86 years. The prevalence of violence in women's current relationships was 12% and 5%, respectively. In both age groups, women who had experienced violence during childhood and nonpartner physical or sexual violence after the age of 16 had higher odds of experiencing current partner violence. Current partner violence was associated only with women and their partner's level of education and women's vocational training among women aged 66 to 86 years. Relationships where one or both partners drank heavily in recent months were associated with higher odds of violence among women aged 50 to 65. Future studies on intimate partner violence need to recognize that women above reproductive risk are also at risk of current partner violence.

Parental Warmth Amplifies the Negative Effect of Parental Hostility on Dating Violence

Author: Simons, Leslie Gordon1; Simons, Ronald L; Lei, Man-Kit; Hancock, Donna L; Fincham, Frank D1 University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364701999?accountid=14925

Abstract: Past research has documented the positive association between parental hostility and offspring involvement in intimate partner violence. Researchers, practitioners, and parents typically adopt the standpoint that parental warmth may counter these negative lessons. However, Straus and colleagues argue that parents foster IPV to the extent that they teach their child that verbal and physical aggression are a normal and legitimate component of loving relationships. A strict interpretation of social learning theory would suggest that these lessons are more, not less, likely to occur when parental hostility is interspersed with displays of affection. The present study tests this idea using data from 2,088 undergraduate students from a large university in the Southeast. Consistent with Straus' arguments, findings suggest that, rather than attenuating the negative effects of hostility, supportive interactions seem to amplify the probability that offspring will emulate aggressive behaviors in their own romantic relationships. The same is true for the effects of harsh parenting for women. It seems that the best way parents can avoid contributing to their child's chances of being in a violent dating relationship is to eschew family interaction involving verbal and physical aggression.

Examining Gender Differences in the Nature and Context of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Cho, Hyunkag11 Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705421?accountid=14925

Abstract: Many studies have been conducted on gender differences in intimate partner violence (IPV), producing inconsistent results. Some studies report that men were victimized by IPV as much as women were, whereas others find that IPV was predominantly perpetrated by men against women. The nature and context of IPV may be crucial to understanding gender differences in IPV, but national data collections do not regularly report on this information. This study expects to fill this gap by using nationally representative data to examine differences in the nature and context of IPV between male and female perpetrators. This study uses the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES). Descriptive statistics for each gender are first obtained (n = 2,190). A discriminant analysis is used with gender as a grouping variable, including only perpetrators of IPV (n = 236). The independent variables are age, race, education, employment, financial security, frequency and severity of IPV, controlling behaviors, and the initiator of physical arguments. The study findings suggest that women and men do not vary much in the prevalence, frequency, and severity of IPV, controlling behaviors, or the initiation of physical arguments. They also suggest that those variables are rather weak in differentiating IPV against men from IPV against women. Since the study revealed some gender differences in IPV and, at the same time, encountered methodological difficulties in convincingly showing them as real gender differences, more research is clearly needed.

Protection Orders Protect Against Assault and Injury: A Longitudinal Study of Police-Involved Women Victims of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Kothari, Catherine L1; Rhodes, Karin V; Wiley, James A; Fink, Jeffrey; Overholt, Scott; Dichter, Melissa E; Marcus, Steven C; Cerulli, Catherine1 Michigan State University/Kalamazoo Center for Medical Studies, Kalamazoo, MI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704758?accountid=14925

Abstract: The objective of this study was to measure the efficacy of protection orders (POs) in reducing assault and injury-related outcomes using a matched comparison group and tracking outcomes over time. This study was a retrospective review of police, emergency department, family court, and prosecutor administrative records for a cohort of police-involved female IPV victims; all events over a 4-year study period were abstracted. Victims who obtained POs were compared with a propensity-score-based match group without POs over three time periods: Before, During, and After the issuance of a PO. Having a PO in place was associated with significantly more calls to police for nonassaultive incidents and more police charging requests that were of multiple-count and felony-level. Comparing outcomes, PO victims had police incident rates that were more than double the matched group prior to the PO but dropped to the level of the matched group during and after the order. ED visits dropped over time for both groups. This study confirmed the protective effect of POs, which are associated with reduced police incidents and emergency department visits both during and after the order and reduced police incidents compared with a matched comparison group.

Patterns of Injuries in Domestic Violence in a Romanian Population

Author: Curca, George Cristian1; Dermengiu, Dan; Hostiuc, Sorin1 Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania, National Institute of Legal Medicine, Bucharest, Romania

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1222981042?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Romania, the quantification of traumatic injuries is achieved in medical- legal services; therefore, each domestic violence (DV) victim needs a medical-legal certificate to prove in a court of law the presence of traumatic injuries. In this study, we aimed to determine the pattern of traumatic injuries in DV. A total of 219 consecutive DV cases were included. For each victim, a detailed medical-legal examination was performed, including specialized consults, if needed. Results were analyzed statistically using the SPSS software. Traumatic injuries in DV cases were usually located in the head, face, and neck areas and had a low severity index. Severe lesions were found in less than 10% and no sexual aggression was found. The severity increases with age and is higher for males than females. The pattern of DV-associated injuries we have encountered is similar to the one found in other similar studies. Knowing this pattern may be useful in clinical practice to detect cases of DV.

Revisiting the Role of Communication in Adolescent Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Messinger, Adam M1; Rickert, Vaughn I; Fry, Deborah A; Lessel, Harriet; Davidson, Leslie L1 Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, IL, USA

Abstract: A growing literature suggests that communication strategies can promote or inhibit intimate partner violence (IPV). Research on communication is still needed on a group ripe for early IPV intervention: high school-aged adolescents. This article revisits our previous analyses of young female reproductive clinic patients (Messinger, Davidson, & Rickert, 2011) by examining how the adolescent and young adult respondents differ. To explore replicability of the adolescent results across populations, they are compared to 487 adolescent female students sampled from four urban high schools. Across samples, all communication strategies were used more frequently within violent relationships. Multivariate analysis identified escalating strategies used and received as being positively associated with physical violence used and received in all three samples. Regarding verbal reasoning and temporary conflict avoidance, substantial differences appeared between the young adult and adolescent clinic samples, and results from the adolescent clinic sample were largely replicated with the adolescent school sample, suggesting that young adult samples in this literature are not adequate proxies for adolescents.

Relationship theories and relationship violence: Is it beneficial to believe in soulmates?

Author: Franiuk, Renae1; Shain, EAshley; Bieritz, Lauren; Murray, Courtney1 Aurora University, USA, rfraniuk@aurora.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1222983162?accountid=14925

Abstract: Franiuk and colleagues (2002) distinguished between two implicit theories of relationships (ITRs)-a soulmate theory and a work-it-out theory. The soulmate theory reflects beliefs that finding the right person is important for relationship success while the work-it-out theory reflects beliefs that relationships take effort to be successful. The current research explores the association between the ITRs and relationship violence. Surveying an older sample than a traditional college sample (N = 143), the ITRs interacted with partner fit and relationship length to predict relationship violence. As predicted, for those with poor partner fit, the soulmate theory was associated with low violence early in relationships, but the soulmate theory lost some of its protective benefits in longer relationships.

Alcohol Abuse and Domestic Violence -- An Interrelationship: A Preliminary Study

Author: Latha, K S11 Department of Psychiatry, K.M.C. Hospital, Manipal University, Manipal 576 104, Karnataka, India drlathaks@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347782149?accountid=14925

Abstract: Alcohol use is frequently associated with violence between intimate partners. The real link between alcohol abuse and domestic violence is difficult to establish. This study intends to examine the prevalence of domestic violence in females attending a psychiatric clinic and the role of alcohol in violence and the nature of violence. Of the 115 cases seen, 65 were married and formed the sample of this study. Domestic violence was reported in 95.6% of the cases. Of the 65 patients, 28(43.1%) had alcohol use in their spouses and in 37(56.9%) was absent or occasional use. Majority of the women had primary school education, hailed from rural and nuclear families. Verbal abuse, neglect of wife and children, among spouses was common in spouses who were abusing alcohol and there were problems with communication, dowry related issues in spouses who had no alcohol related issues. Some implications are suggested. Adapted from the source document.

The Feminization of Social Welfare: Implications of Cultural Tradition vis-a-vis Male Victims of Domestic Violence

Author: Hall, Ronald E11 School of Social Work 224 Baker Hall Michigan State University East Lansing, MI 48824 hallr@msu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283640910?accountid=14925

Abstract: As pertains to feminization of social welfare, the inability to acknowledge male victims of domestic violence is attributed less to personal preference and more to cultural traditions of the Western patriarch. Yet, according to scholarly literature, men in the U.S. are equally as likely to be the victims of domestic violence by women as are women by men. Solutions to cultural tradition aimed at eliminating male victims of domestic violence must necessarily begin with acknowledgement of the characteristic warning signs and symptoms. Moving beyond the feminization of social welfare as pertains to domestic violence can be accomplished by the recognition that cultural tradition should not be the sole determinant of services. An effective tool is application of more objective policy models which better locate the role of culture in the perception and attention to all victims in need. Adapted from the source document.

Drinking Context and Intimate Partner Violence: Evidence From the California Community Health Study of Couples

Author: Cunradi, Carol B1; Mair, Christina; Todd, Michael; Remer, Lillian1 Prevention Research Center, Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 450, Berkeley, CA 94704

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463011148?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: Couples in which one or both partners is a heavy or problem drinker are at elevated risk for intimate partner violence (IPV), yet little is known about the extent to which each partner's drinking in different contexts (volume consumed per setting in bars, parties, at home, or in public places) increases the likelihood that partner aggression will occur. This study examined associations between the volume consumed in different settings by each partner and the occurrence and frequency of IPV. Method: We obtained a geographic sample of married or cohabiting couples residing in 50 medium to large California cities. Cross-sectional survey data were collected via confidential telephone interviews (60% response rate). Logistic and negative binomial regression analyses were based on 1,585 couples who provided information about past-12-month IPV, drinking contexts (number of times attended, proportion of drinking occasions when attended, average number of drinks), frequency of intoxication, and psychosocial and demographic factors. Drinking context-IPV associations for each partner were adjusted for the other partner's volume for that context and other covariates. Results: Male partner's volume per setting for bars and parks or public places was associated with the occurrence and frequency of male-to-female IPV and female-to-male IPV. Male's volume per setting for quiet evening at home was associated with the occurrence of female-to-male IPV; female partner's volume for this setting was associated with the frequency of male-to-female IPV and female-to-male IPV. Conclusions: Among couples in the general population, each partner's drinking in certain contexts is an independent risk factor for the occurrence and frequency of partner aggression. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate partner violence against adult women and its association with major depressive disorder, depressive symptoms and postpartum depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis

Author: Beydoun, Hind A1; Beydoun, May A; Kaufman, Jay S; Lo, Bruce; Zonderman, Alan B1 Graduate Program in Public Health, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Post Office Box 1980, Norfolk, VA 23501-1980, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1266144913?accountid=14925

Abstract: To date, few systematic reviews of observational studies have been conducted to comprehensively evaluate the co-morbidity of intimate partner violence (IPV) and specific depression outcomes in women. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we summarize the extant literature and estimate the magnitude of the association between IPV and key depressive outcomes (elevated depressive symptoms, diagnosed major depressive disorder and postpartum depression). PubMed (January 1, 1980-December 31, 2010) searches of English-language observational studies were conducted. Most of the selected 37 studies had cross-sectional population-based designs, focused on elevated depressive symptoms and were conducted in the United States. Most studies suggested moderate or strong positive associations between IPV and depression. Our meta-analysis suggested two to three-fold increased risk of major depressive disorder and 1.5-2-fold increased risk of elevated depressive symptoms and postpartum depression among women exposed to intimate partner violence relative to non-exposed women. A sizable proportion (9%-28%) of major depressive disorder, elevated depressive symptoms, and postpartum depression can be attributed to lifetime exposure to IPV. In an effort to reduce the burden of depression, continued research is recommended for evaluating IPV preventive strategies. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

Portrayal of Women as Intimate Partner Domestic Violence Perpetrators

Author: Hester, Marianne11 University of Bristol, Bristol, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364701591?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article explores some of the ways heterosexual women are portrayed as perpetrators of intimate partner domestic violence (IPV) in police domestic violence records in England and is the first study in the United Kingdom to examine the issue of gender and domestic violence perpetrators in any detail and over time. The article is based on a study of 128 IPV cases tracked longitudinally over 6 years, including 32 cases where women were the sole perpetrators and a further 32 cases where women were "dual" perpetrators alongside men. Women were 3 times more likely than men to be arrested when they were construed as the perpetrator. However, Pence and Dasgupta's category of "pathological violence" appeared more useful as an analytical category in the construction of women as "perpetrators" and men as "victims" than the notion of "battering.".

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705415?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women with disabilities are frequent victims of domestic violence, yet scant research has examined self-protective mechanisms that could mitigate this abuse. This article reviews prevalence and types of intimate partner Violence Against Women with disabilities and explores the factors that leave this population at higher risk for abuse than nondisabled women. Barriers to self-protection against domestic violence for women with diverse disabilities are highlighted and the use of nonfatal force as self-defense is explored. A case example and considerations for enhancing self-protection strategies for women with disabilities experiencing intimate partner violence are provided.

Abstract: This study documents the preliminary program evaluation of a 10-session group intervention designed to address the needs of children exposed to domestic violence. The program was developed to promote five primary outcomes: (a) alleviation of guilt/shame, (b) improvement of self-esteem, (c) establishment of trust/teamwork skills, (d) enhancement of personal safety and assertiveness skills, and (e) abuse prevention. A series of pre- and posttest intervention measures provide comparison data. Study findings indicated an overall decrease in depressive symptomology, symptoms of psychosocial impairment, and certain problematic behaviors and as a result, supports continuation of the program. Despite a small sample and other limitations, the program offers a promising framework for intervention with children exposed to domestic violence. Findings both highlight the need for accessible, appropriate measures and reinforce the need for the intervention planning phase to include careful consideration of clear intervention goals, evaluation instrumentation, participant selection, and strategies to solicit participation, sustain membership, and secure posttest data. Implications are relevant to practitioners and researchers in the field.

Building Bridges: Training Social Work Students in Domestic Violence Work

Author: LeGeros, Melanie; Borne, Jackie Savage

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438555987?accountid=14925

Abstract: Many domestic violence programs have internships for social work students, increasing the capacity of the field to respond to the complex needs of survivors. These social work field placements in domestic violence advocacy settings present challenges for students to connect the experiences and lessons of social work clinical internships to the content and theories presented in the classroom, where relatively little time is focused on domestic violence dynamics and interventions. This article will describe how social work concepts, such as the empowerment approach, are "made real" in Passageway, a domestic violence program based in a Boston hospital. Over the course of a two-day orientation, social work interns are introduced to central concepts (empowerment approach, ecological perspective, trauma theory) and key foundational knowledge of domestic violence dynamics and interventions. Quality clinical supervision helps interns work through the dilemmas involved in applying knowledge and theory in practice. The Passageway program takes care to embody the social work value of empowerment through collaborative supervision, collegial staff meetings, an intern group, and consultative interactions with the larger hospital. This description of the Passageway internship will incorporate responses from intern evaluation of the training and its fit with their academic courses. The most important implication of student feedback is the need for greater collaboration between schools of social work and domestic violence internships, with an eye to increased understanding of domestic violence as a social work issue. We envision this occurring not only through collaborations with field education departments but also through joint curriculum development and intergroup dialogue about dilemmas in domestic violence practice.

Health, Access to Health Care, and Health Care use Among Homeless Women with a History of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Vijayaraghavan, Maya1; Tochterman, Ana; Hsu, Eustace; Johnson, Karen; Marcus, Sue; Caton, Carol L M1 Cancer Prevention and Control Program, Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA mvijayaraghavan@ucsd.edu

Abstract: Among a sample of sheltered homeless women, we examined health, access to health care, and health care use overall and among the subgroup of participants with and without intimate partner violence (IPV). We recruited homeless women from a random sampling of shelters in New York City, and queried them on health, access to health care and health care use. Using multivariable logistic regression, we determined whether IPV was associated with past-year use of emergency, primary care and outpatient mental health services. Of the 329 participants, 31.6% reported one or more cardiovascular risk factors, 32.2% one or more sexually transmitted infections, and 32.2% any psychiatric condition. Three-fourths (73.5%) had health insurance. Health care use varied: 55.4% used emergency, 48.9% primary care, and 75.9% outpatient mental health services in the past year. Across all participants, 44.7% reported IPV. Participants with IPV compared to those without were more likely to report medical and psychiatric conditions, and be insured. Participants with IPV reported using emergency (64.4%) more than primary care (55.5%) services. History of IPV was independently associated with use of emergency (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.7), but not primary care (AOR 1.5, 95% CI 0.9-2.6) or outpatient mental health services (AOR 1.9, 95% CI 0.9-4.1). Across the whole sample and among the subgroup with IPV, participants used emergency more than primary care services despite being relatively highly insured. Identifying and eliminating non-financial barriers to primary care may increase reliance on primary care among this high-risk group. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence in Paris, 1775

Author: Merrick, Jeffrey11 Emeritus University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA jmerrick@uwm.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283639894?accountid=14925

Abstract: In 1775, 135 wives and 35 husbands filed complaints against their spouses with the Parisian commissioners of police. Most of the wives charged their husbands with verbal and physical violence, and a few of them initiated lawsuits for separation of property and/or persons. In those cases, the depositions of witnesses document conventional expectations about gendered roles in the household as well as the dynamics of communication, representation, and justification in the neighborhood. Against the background of debates about the use and abuse of royal authority in the decades preceding the Revolution, the complaints and lawsuits show that the traditional family/state model not only downplayed accountability in principle but also sanctioned accountability in practice.

The Social Context of Woman-to-Woman Intimate Partner Abuse (WWIPA)

Author: McDonald, Courtney11 Department of Psychology/Sociology, Georgia Southwestern State University, 800 GSW University Drive, Americus, GA, 31709, USA mcdonald@canes.gsw.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364700677?accountid=14925

Abstract: Forty women who had been in abusive adult, intimate relationships with other women were interviewed. Their life experiences leading up to these abusive relationships were qualitatively examined to determine how heterosexism created a social context in which women were left vulnerable to abuse and dependent on their abusers. Childhood abuse, negative coming out experiences, lack of a queer community, and substance/alcohol abuse contributed to survivors' vulnerability to abuse by making them socially isolated from a support system and dependent on their partners to reconstruct a sense of family. Adapted from the source document.

Burden of Womanhood: Tamil Women's Perceptions of Coping with Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Kanagaratnam, Pushpa1; Mason, Robin; Hyman, Ilene; Manuel, Lisa; Berman, Helene; Toner, Brenda1 Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto pushpakanagaratnam@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364700694?accountid=14925

Abstract: Helping women victimized by intimate partner violence (IPV) is a challenge, particularly when the women belong to diverse ethnic groups. The objective of our study was to collect information on perceptions of coping with IPV from the perspective of a specific immigrant group of women. Sixty-three women from the Tamil community in Toronto representing different generations and experiences of IPV were interviewed in focus group settings about their views of coping with IPV. Study findings suggested that their views were deeply embedded in their sociocultural context and influenced by the gender-role expectations from the community. The women showed a marked preference for "passive" modes of coping rather than "active." Study findings have implications for the development of alternative approaches to helping ethnically diverse women deal with IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Bridging Prevention and Health: Exploring Community Perceptions of Intimate Partner Violence in Rural Honduras

Author: Sukhera, Javeed1; Cerulli, Catherine; Gawinski, Barbara A; Morse, Diane1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, NY, USA, javeedsukhera@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1222971296?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study rooted in community-based participatory research principles utilized semi-structured interviews with 2 focus groups (n=9) with female healthcare volunteers (FCVs) and 3 male key informants who were community leaders (MCLs). The study aimed to examine how a rural Honduran community defines and responds to intimate partner violence (IPV) in order to lay the foundation for future interventions. Based on grounded theory, the authors assessed for common themes across transcripts. Authors found that a number of participants denied the existence of IPV. Perspectives on the causes and definitions of IPV varied between FCVs and MCLs. All participants affirmed the need for intervention and many participants mentioned healthcare and legal systems as potential venues to ameliorate IPV. The results highlight potentially important differences between FCV and MCL perspectives that may inform future interventions. Findings suggest healthcare workers can play a role in IPV prevention and intervention in rural Honduras.

Intimate Partner Violence Among Asian Americans and Their Use of Mental Health Services: Comparisons with White, Black, and Latino Victims

Author: Cho, Hyunkag1; Kim, Woo Jong1 School of Social Work, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, 48824, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322722825?accountid=14925

Abstract: Studies have been conducted on intimate partner violence (IPV) among Asian Americans, but knowledge on their use of mental health services is limited. This study seeks to fill this gap by using a national sample to examine Asian victims' use of mental health services. We analyzed data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys. The dependent variable was use of mental health services. The independent variables included race, employment, and the type of IPV. Results showed that Asian victims used the service less than other racial groups. The rates of use of mental health services were lower among older people and men. The lowest rate of mental health service use among Asian victims indicates a possible gap between their needs to be met and mental health services available to them.

Abstract: This study examined the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and unintended pregnancy using data from women reporting IPV in the 2007 Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey. The analysis included 4,695 married women, aged 15 to 40 years, who had at least one birth in the last 5 years. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between IPV and pregnancy. About one third (30.4%) of women were abused physically and/or sexually and about one third (30.9%) of their births in the last 5 years were unintended. Compared with women who suffered no IPV, women who were abused sexually had a 1.64-fold increased risk of unintended pregnancy, which is higher than those who suffered physical abuse only (odds ratio: 1.35). The prevalence of unintended pregnancy among those who experienced severe physical violence was 1.60 times higher than those who reported no abuse. The findings indicate a significant relationship between IPV and unintended pregnancy among Bangladeshi women. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Risk Factors for Domestic Violence in Curacao

Author: van Wijk, NPhL1; de Bruijn, JGM1 Ministry of Health, Environment, and Nature of Curacao

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1222940578?accountid=14925

Abstract: One out of three people (25% of men, 38% of women) in Curacao have experienced some form of domestic violence at some point in their adult lives. The most significant risk factors for domestic violence in Curacao are the female gender, a young age, low education, and experiencing domestic violence victimization in childhood. Divorce, single parenthood, and unemployment increase the risk for women, but not for men. These findings are consistent with current literature on the subject. Further research on the context, nature, and severity of domestic violence in the Caribbean is necessary. Studies should preferably combine the strengths of national crime surveys and family conflict studies: nationally representative samples (including men and women) and questionnaires that include all possible experiences of psychological, physical, and sexual assaults by current and former partners, family, and friends.

Trends in Intimate Partner Violence: 1980-2008

Author: Powers, Rachael A1; Kaukinen, Catherine Elizabeth1 University of South Florida, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704895?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on trends in partner violence has primarily relied on official measures of victimization focusing primarily on women's risk for intimate partner homicide. The current study uses 28 years of data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) to examine the trends of intimate partner violence against female victims and identify variation in women's risk as a function of race and employment. Although it has been theorized that employment is correlated with the risk of intimate partner victimization for women, research has not thoroughly addressed this in a longitudinal context. In addition, research has not explored the extent to which intimate partner violence is correlated with the combined variables of race and employment. The authors find that between 1980 and the mid-2000s employment is associated with an increase in women's risk for intimate partner violence. However, the conclusion that the rate of victimization is higher for employed women appears to be partly contingent on the victims' race. The trend for non-White unemployed women appears to be relatively comparable to both White and non-White employed women, at least for the first 15 years of the series.

Social Worker Interventions in Situations of Domestic Violence: What We Can Learn from Survivors' Personal Narratives

Author: Keeling, June1; van Wormer, Katherine1 Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Health and Social Care, University of Chester j.keeling@chester.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322722078?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social workers are an integral provider in the statutory support offered to women experiencing domestic violence. This paper uses information obtained from women's personal narratives to examine this social worker-client relationship in situations of domestic violence. Embracing a feminist standpoint epistemology and focusing on the women's experiences, it is evident that many of the women expressed dissatisfaction with the way they were treated by social workers. Threats to remove the children from the home and victim blaming were among the tactics described. The parallel between such reported forms of coercion employed by social workers and those used by the abuser are striking. The findings suggest a lack of a favourable climate to ensure the safety of the woman and her family through the provision of family-centred care and a need to build more effective and supportive relationships with women experiencing domestic violence. Implications for social work practice are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Factors Affecting Prevalence and Extent of Intimate Partner Violence in Ukraine: Evidence From a Nationally Representative Survey

Author: Barrett, Betty Jo1; Habibov, Nazim; Chernyak, Elena1 University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705568?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the prevalence and ecological correlates of intimate partner Violence Against Women in Ukraine. A nationally representative sample of ever-married female respondents of the 2007 Ukraine Demographic Health Survey was used for this analysis. Findings suggest that although numerous ecological factors predict women's experiences of emotional, physical, and sexual intimate partner violence, two factors were common correlates of all three forms of violence: the frequent intoxication of women's partners and the exhibition of marital controlling behaviors by male perpetrators. Implications for the development of effective programming to prevent violence against Ukrainian women are provided. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Once Is Not Enough: Effective Strategies for Medical Student Education on Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Buranosky, Raquel1; Hess, Rachel; McNeil, Melissa A; Aiken, Allison M; Chang, Judy C1 Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705575?accountid=14925

Abstract: Training in intimate partner violence (IPV) improves health professionals' knowledge and comfort regarding IPV; the optimal training frequency and format is unknown. We assessed how various types and amounts of IPV education for medical students affected knowledge and attitudes. Medical students at a large, urban university completed a survey concerning IPV-related knowledge and attitudes and participation in didactic and experiential IPV training activities. This was a one-time assessment. Of 586 students, 279 (48%) completed the survey. IPV-related knowledge increased with increased number of training activities. Knowledge and attitude scores were higher (p < .001) for respondents with experiential, versus only didactic, activities. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Intimate Partner Violence in Southwestern Nigeria: Are There Rural-Urban Differences

Author: Balogun, Mary O1; Owoaje, Eme T; Fawole, Olufunmilayo I1 Department of Preventive Medicine and Primary Care, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria mobalogun2004@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347782452?accountid=14925

Abstract: The researchers in this study assessed the prevalence of different types and experience of intimate partner violence among 600 women aged 15 to 49 years in selected rural and urban communities in southwestern Nigeria between October and December, 2007. Lifetime prevalence of intimate partner violence was 64% in the rural and 70% in the urban areas. Controlling behavior was the most frequently reported type of intimate partner violence experienced by both groups of women, and sexual violence was reported least. More urban women reported sexual violence and controlling behaviors than rural women (16.4% versus 11.6% and 57.7% versus 42.0%, respectively). More rural women had experienced physical violence (28% versus 14%). More urban women experienced controlling behaviors, while more rural women experienced physical violence. In both locations, history of partners' involvement in physical fights was significantly associated with reporting sexual violence (rural: odds ratio [OR] = 3.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-12.3; urban: OR = 8.4; 95% CI 1.4-51.8). History of alcohol consumption by partners was significantly associated with reporting physical violence (rural: OR = 2.3; 95% CI 1.2-4.4; urban: OR = 3.2; 95% CI 1.4-7.2). However, among rural respondents, younger partners were more likely to perpetuate controlling behavior (OR = 5.1; 95% CI 1.7-15.6) and being in a relationship for >=10 years was related to psychological and physical violence. Among urban respondents, history of partners' involvement in physical fights was associated with controlling behavior (OR = 8.2; 95% CI 1.1-65.4) and physical violence (OR = 4.5; 95% CI 1.2-17.3). These results suggest that intimate partner violence is a frequent experience in women in both communities, although the types of intimate partner violence experienced differed, and multidisciplinary strategies are required to reduce intimate partner violence.

Abstract: Background: Identifying intimate partner violence in healthcare settings is becoming the standard of care. The Brief Inpatient Screen was designed to assess recent emotional, physical, and sexual abuse in a general inpatient medical-surgical setting and compared to the Composite Abuse Scale. Methods: Researchers matched "cases" (inpatients screening Brief Inpatient Screen-positive) to up to four "controls" (inpatients screening Brief Inpatient Screen-negative). Forty-six female hospital inpatients ages 18-64 years completed a self-administered survey. The sensitivity and specificity of the Brief Inpatient Screen and its subscales were compared to the Composite Abuse Scale. Researchers examined the performance of the Brief Inpatient Screen when used as a verbal screen versus an anonymous written screen. Results: Twelve of 46 participants (26%) had a positive screen. Compared to the Composite Abuse Scale, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the verbal Brief Inpatient Screen were 52.6% (95% CI 28.9-75.6) and 92.6% (95% CI 75.7-99.1), respectively. The written Brief Inpatient Screen showed improved sensitivity overall (68.4%, 95% CI 43.5-87.4) for the most severe intimate partner violence. Subscale analysis revealed greater sensitivity for emotional and severe combined intimate partner violence. Conclusions: The verbal Brief Inpatient Screen, when compared to the Composite Abuse Scale, was limited in its ability to identify intimate partner violence. An anonymous written format improved sensitivity. Future research should optimize intimate partner violence screening among inpatients. Adapted from the source document.

Factors That Contribute or Impede the Physical Health Recovery of Women Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence: A Longitudinal Study

Author: Sanchez-Lorente, Segunda; Blasco-Ros, Concepcion; Martinez, Manuela

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429624427?accountid=14925

Abstract: Background: Several cross-sectional studies have demonstrated the negative impact that intimate partner violence (IPV) has on the physical health of women. However, longitudinal studies are needed to establish the time course of this effect. This study assessed the physical health course of female IPV victims and established the factors that enhance or impede their recovery. Methods: Women (n=91) who participated in a previous cross-sectional study (T-1) and were either victims of physical/psychological IPV (n=33) or psychological IPV (n=23) were evaluated 3 years later (T-2). A control group of women (n=35) was included for comparison. Structured interviews provided information regarding IPV characteristics, physical health, and lifestyle. Findings: Physical symptoms decreased over time for both groups of abused women. Factors that contributed to this improvement were perception of social support and the cessation of physical IPV. Factors that impaired recovery included cohabitation with the aggressor, victimization experiences at T-2, negative perceptions of life events, and continuing psychological IPV. Conclusions: This study shows that physical health improvement is possible in female victims of IPV, but that continuing psychological IPV hinders recovery. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the factors that best predict health recovery in female IPV victims to design effective intervention programs.

INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE IN U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS: THE CONTEXTUAL INFLUENCES OF POLICE AND SOCIAL SERVICES*

Author: Xie, Min1; Lauritsen, Janet L; Heimer, Karen1 School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Arizona State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417524809?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although community responses to the problem of intimate partner violence typically focus on increasing and improving policing and social services, few studies have examined the relationship among police force size, social service providers, and women's safety at home. To address this issue, we use data from the National Crime Victimization Survey to examine patterns of intimate partner violence for 40 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) over a 16-year period (1989-2004). We analyze the data using three-level multilevel models, with individual respondents (N = 487,166) nested within years, nested within MSAs. Net of other important individual and contextual factors, the results show that women's likelihood of victimization is significantly lower in MSAs that employ more sworn officers per capita, whereas the states' mandatory arrest laws are not found to have significant independent effects. Above and beyond the effects of police force size, we also find a significant negative relationship between the size of the social service workforce and intimate partner violence. Future research should develop collaborative data collection efforts to examine the specific activities of police and social service workers in dealing with intimate partner violence so that the mechanisms underlying these significant relationships can be understood more clearly.

Children's best interests and intimate partner violence in the Canadian family law and child protection systems

Author: Hughes, Judy; Chau, Shirley

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1221412603?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article summarizes the findings of a project investigating women's experiences with the Canadian child protection (CPS) and family law (FLS) systems. We examine both service systems together here because although both privilege children's best interests as their primary consideration and define the concept similarly, the two systems diverge in their expectations of women relative to child custody. While FLS requires women to accept custody arrangements that provide close and continued contact between themselves and their former abusive partners, CPS expects women to leave these same abusive partners or risk removal of their children. The results of thirty-five qualitative interviews with women demonstrate their struggles, firstly, in having their experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV) recognized by professionals in the FLS, and, secondly, in becoming caught between the opposing expectations of CPS and FLS while not receiving help from either. Recommendations for change to improve these services are included in this article. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

'I'm not sexist, but . . .': How ideological dilemmas reinforce sexism in talk about intimate partner violence

Author: Harris, Kate Lockwood; Palazzolo, Kellie E; Savage, Matthew W

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364699422?accountid=14925

Abstract: In order to extend knowledge about the communicative aspects of intimate partner violence (IPV), we ask how those who talk about IPV frame the relationship between gender and power. How does their framing account for the role of gender in IPV perpetration? A critical discourse analysis of conversations from focus groups and interviews reveals that when participants talk about IPV, they rely on ideological dilemmas in available understandings of the relationship between gender and power. As participants use disclaimers, competing interpretive repertoires, and extreme case arguments to navigate these dilemmas, their talk closes space for a critique of gender and power that considers systemic factors and benevolent sexism. Instead, participants focus more on individual pathology and the most overt forms of sexism. The tensions that produce this closure may also reveal contradictions that provide opportunities for reshaping public conversations about IPV and its relationship to gender and power.

The characteristics and violence risk management of women arrested by the police for intimate partner violence

Author: Storey, Jennifer E; Strand, Susanne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448996506?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research and management efforts in the area of intimate partner violence (IPV) have primarily focused on male perpetrators and female victims, resulting in more limited knowledge of female IPV perpetrators and their male victims. In the current study the violence risk assessments of police officers were examined in order to outline the characteristics of female perpetrators of IPV and their male victims. In addition, the officers' assessments of violence risk and proposed risk management strategies are presented. Results reveal some similarities between the female perpetrators and male victims and their more studied counterparts. However, differences appear to be present in the perceived violence risk posed by the perpetrators and the violence risk management strategies proposed to reduce that risk and protect the victim. The results suggest a need for further research in the area, particularly with respect to the violence risk assessment and management of female IPV perpetrators.

Women's disclosure of dating violence: A mixed methodological study

Author: Edwards, Katie M1; Dardis, Christina M; Gidycz, Christine A1 University of New Hampshire, USA, Katie.Edwards@unh.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1316493251?accountid=14925

Abstract: The researchers utilized quantitative and qualitative methods to examine college women's disclosure of dating violence. Quantitative analyses showed that disclosure of dating violence was related to stress associated with abuse, partner blame, and thoughts about ending the relationship. Qualitative content analyses demonstrated that women's minimization of the abuse was the most commonly given reason for nondisclosure. Women who disclosed dating violence reported that the following responses to their disclosures were most helpful: receiving 'good advice', the opportunity to vent/talk about it, receiving comfort and other emotional support, rationalizing the partners' behavior, and providing a neutral perspective. Conversely, the following responses were reported as least helpful: being told to end the relationship, not understanding, joking about the experiences, and 'bad advice'. Implications for intervention and future research are discussed.

'Coaching Boys into Men': A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial of a Dating Violence Prevention Program

Author: Miller, Elizabeth; Tancredi, Daniel J; McCauley, Heather L; Decker, Michele R; Virata, Maria Catrina D; Anderson, Heather A; Stetkevich, Nicholas; Brown, Ernest W; Moideen, Feroz; Silverman, Jay G

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283644322?accountid=14925

Abstract: Purpose: Dating violence (DV) -- physical, sexual, and psychological aggression in adolescent romantic relationships -- is prevalent among youth. Despite broad calls for primary prevention, few programs with demonstrated effectiveness exist. This cluster-randomized trial examined the effectiveness of a DV perpetration prevention program targeting coaches and high school male athletes. Methods: The unit of randomization was the high school (16 schools), and the unit of analysis was the athlete (N = 2,006 students). Primary outcomes were intentions to intervene, recognition of abusive behaviors, and gender-equitable attitudes. Secondary outcomes explored bystander behaviors and abuse perpetration. Regression models for clustered, longitudinal data assessed between-arm differences in over-time changes in mean levels of continuous outcomes in 1,798 athletes followed up at 3 months. Results: Intervention athletes' changes in intentions to intervene were positive compared with control subjects, resulting in an estimated intervention effect of .12 (95% CI: .003, .24). Intervention athletes also reported higher levels of positive bystander intervention behavior than control subjects (.25, 95% CI: .13, .38). Changes in gender-equitable attitudes, recognition of abusive behaviors, and DV perpetration were not significant. Secondary analyses estimated intervention impacts according to intensity of program implementation. Compared with control subjects, athletes exposed to full-intensity implementation of the intervention demonstrated improvements in intentions to intervene (.16, 95% CI: .04, .27), recognition of abusive behaviors (.13, 95% CI: .003, .25), and positive bystander intervention (.28, 95% CI: .14, .41).

ATTITUDES TOWARDS JUSTIFYING INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AMONG MARRIED WOMEN IN BANGLADESH

Author: SAYEM, AMIR MOHAMMAD1; BEGUM, HOUSNE ARA; MONEESHA, SHANTA SHYAMOLEE1 South East Asia Journal of Public Health, Dhaka, Bangladesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1559007789?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines women's attitude towards intimate partner violence among 331 Bangladeshi women in five selected disadvantaged areas of Dhaka city. This study used a shorter version of the Inventory of Beliefs about Wife Beating (IBWB) to measure women's attitude towards intimate partner violence. The results revealed that the mean score on the wife-beating scale of 15 items was 7.81 (SD=4.893). Significant amounts of the variance (42.9%) in women's attitude towards intimate partner violence can be attributed to respondent's education (B=-0.60, p<0.001), husband's education (B=-1.251, p<0.01), exposure to mass media (B=-1.251, p<0.01), respondent's current age (B=0.081, p<0.05), age at marriage (B=0.215, p<0.01), intimate partner violence victimization within the last 12 months (B=-1.533, p<0.001) and women receiving micro-credit (small-scale loan or financial assistance) (B= -2.214, p<0.001). The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings. Adapted from the source document.

Parenting in Females Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence and Childhood Sexual Abuse

Author: Jaffe, Anna E1; Cranston, Christopher C; Shadlow, Joanna O1 University of Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704975?accountid=14925

Abstract: Child sexual abuse and intimate partner violence may have a significant impact on parenting. The current study expands on existing research by examining the effects of child sexual abuse and intimate partner violence on parenting styles and parenting self-efficacy. In women from a parenting intervention program (n = 20), child sexual abuse was related to lower parenting self-efficacy and more permissive parenting. In women at a domestic violence shelter (n = 45), child sexual abuse was related to current sexual coercion of the partner, and authoritative parenting was related to higher parenting self-efficacy. These results indicate that having a history of child sexual abuse should be taken into consideration when dealing with mothers in violent relationships. Adapted from the source document.

Physical Health Effects of Intimate Partner Abuse

Author: Sillito, Carrie LeFevre11 University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1223126569?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although intimate partner violence has been recognized as both a social problem and health issue, the extent to which it is a health issue for both males and females in the general population is largely unknown. This longitudinal research uses data from the National Survey of Family and Households (1987-2003). Random effects logistic regression models are used to assess physical health outcomes of exposure to intimate partner abuse for males and females. Results indicate that females are significantly more likely to report poor health if exposed to intimate partner abuse. The same is not true for males. Findings of this research indicate a need to explore further sex differences in violence outcomes. These findings are likely to be of interest to those who study families, intimate partner abuse, and health.

The Prevalence of Mental Health Problems in Men Arrested for Domestic Violence

Author: Shorey, Ryan C1; Febres, Jeniimarie; Brasfield, Hope; Stuart, Gregory L1 Department of Psychology, University of Tennessee -- Knoxville, 204 Austin Peay Building, Knoxville, TN, USA rshorey@utk.edu

Abstract: The problem of male perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV) is widespread. In an effort to identify risk factors for perpetrating IPV, researchers have examined mental health problems among perpetrators. However, the majority of research in this area has examined personality psychopathology and/or limited their investigation to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression. Thus, the present study examined self-reported Axis I psychopathology among men arrested for domestic violence (N=308). Results replicated past research showing high rates of PTSD and depression. In addition, the prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social phobia, and alcohol and drug disorders were very high. All types of mental health problems were positively associated with aggression perpetration. Males meeting probable diagnostic classification reported significantly more frequent aggression than males not meeting diagnostic classification, even after controlling for social desirability. Directions for future research and implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Implicit Theories in Intimate Partner Violence Offenders

Author: Weldon, Sarah1; Gilchrist, Elizabeth1 Department of Clinical Psychology, Medical School, University of Edinburgh, Teviot Place, Edinburgh, Scotland, EH8 9AG, UK sarah.weldon@nhs.net

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705447?accountid=14925

Abstract: Cognitive characteristics of intimate partner violence (IPV) offenders have received considerable attention recently. The implicit theories underlying these cognitions have yet to be evidenced using accounts of IPV males. In this study, interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyze interview transcripts of six IPV offenders currently serving a custodial sentence in a Scottish prison to identify potential implicit theories. Analyses resulted in the identification of 11 potential implicit theories of IPV: "violence is acceptable;" "grievance/revenge;" "need for control;" "real man;" "entitlement/women are objects;" "male sex drive is uncontrollable/policing partner;" "women are provoking;" "rejection/abandonment;" "women as supportive;" "external factors responsible;" and "nature of harm." The implicit theories are compared across other groups of offender and implications for offender interventions discussed. Adapted from the source document.

"What Fresh Hell Is This?" Victims of Intimate Partner Violence Describe Their Experiences of Abuse, Pain, and Depression

Author: Cerulli, Catherine1; Poleshuck, Ellen; Raimondi, Christina; Veale, Stephanie; Chin, Nancy1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364701552?accountid=14925

Abstract: Traditionally, professionals working with intimate partner violence (IPV) survivors view a victim through a disciplinary lens, examining health and safety in isolation. Using focus groups with survivors, this study explored the need to address IPV consequences with an integrated model and begin to understand the interconnectedness between violence, health, and safety. Focus group findings revealed that the inscription of pain on the body serves as a reminder of abuse, in turn triggering emotional and psychological pain and disrupting social relationships. In many cases, the physical abuse had stopped but the abuser was relentless by reminding and retraumatizing the victim repeatedly through shared parenting, prolonged court cases, etc. This increased participants' exhaustion and frustration, making the act of daily living overwhelming. Adapted from the source document.

What Happens Before Intimate Partner Violence? Distal and Proximal Antecedents

Author: Byun, Sung-hun11 School of Criminal Justice, Rutgers University, 123 Washington Street, 5th Floor, Newark, NJ, 07102, USA byunbee@rutgers.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705343?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although research on intimate partner violence (IPV) has emphasized the importance of building situational frameworks and event-based research, our knowledge of the contexts surrounding IPV is particularly limited for immigrants. The present study identifies the sequence of specific antecedents of IPV and their relationships with one another. This study is a content analysis of online postings on an anonymous internet forum for Korean married women living in the U.S. Ninety-five postings narrating IPV episodes from the direct experiences of the posters were selected. With a novel method named the "might-cause chain," violence was extracted from the narratives and then traced back to prior actions. Results suggest that environmental settings of IPV can be expanded from immediate proximal situations (triggers), through contingent pathways, to distal context. The roles of verbal exchange, alcohol, in-laws, and self-control, and the patterns of demand interactions, IPV cycles or continuums, and dispute-related violence are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This research examined the prevalence and correlates of intimate partner violence (IPV) among younger, middle-aged, and older Korean American women. Data were drawn from telephone interviews of a population-based, representative probability sample (N=592) of female adults of Korean descent residing in California, with a completion rate of 70 %. Data were grouped by age. In each group, psychological aggression was the most common type of IPV in the past year, followed by a moderate form of sexual coercion, while physical assault and injury were infrequent. Immigration stress was associated with psychological aggression in all three groups, and partner alcohol use was associated in none. Other predictors varied by group. Results suggest that psychological abuse is a serious issue, and that women's life stage is an important consideration in IPV among Korean Americans. Findings, which sometimes diverged from those of prior studies of this population, merit further investigation. Adapted from the source document.

Explaining the Relationship Between Insecure Attachment and Partner Abuse: The Role of Personality Characteristics

Author: Buck, Nicole ML1; Leenaars, Ellie PEM; Emmelkamp, Paul MG; van Marle, Hjalmar JC1 Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1223123629?accountid=14925

Abstract: Studies have found that male batterers are more often insecurely attached as compared with nonbatterers. However, it is still not clear how insecure attachment is related to domestic violence. Many studies compared batterers and nonbatterers regarding pathological personality characteristics that are related to attachment (e.g., dependency, jealousy) and generally found that batterers report more personality characteristics. However, these studies did not investigate which role these characteristics played in the relationship between insecure attachment and battering. The first aim of this study is to test which personality characteristics are good candidates to explain the relationship between insecure attachment and domestic violence. The second aim is to test whether personality characteristics are predictive of battering over and above attachment. Seventy-two mainly court-mandated family-only males who were in group treatment for battering are allocated to a securely and an insecurely attached group and compared with 62 nonbatterers. Using questionnaires, self-esteem, dependency, general distrust, distrust in partner, jealousy, lack of empathy, separation anxiety, desire for control, and impulsivity were assessed. This was the first study that examined distrust, separation anxiety, and desire for control in relation to battering. The results show that the relationship between insecure attachment and domestic violence can be explained by separation anxiety and partner distrust. Moreover, only partner distrust increased the risk for battering over and above insecure attachment. The findings suggest the presence of two subtypes among batterers based on attachment style, which has similarities to the family-only and dysphoric-borderline subtypes suggested by Holtzworth-Munroe and Stuart. Implications of the present findings for therapy are discussed.

Perceptions of Domestic Violence: The Effects of Domestic Violence Myths, Victim's Relationship With Her Abuser, and the Decision to Return to Her Abuser

Author: Yamawaki, Niwako1; Ochoa-Shipp, Monica; Pulsipher, Craig; Harlos, Andrew; Swindler, Scott1 Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705278?accountid=14925

Abstract: Researchers in this study examined the attitudes toward domestic violence, the victim, and her perpetrator. A total of 194 participants were randomly assigned to one of 4 hypothetical scenarios to evaluate how observers' perceptions were influenced by their own sex and myths about domestic violence, by the victim's decision to return to the abusive relationship, and by the relationship status of the victim (dating or married to the perpetrator). Results demonstrated significant main effects of participant's sex, domestic violence myths, and of the victim's relationship status and decision to return. That is, participants blamed the victim who reportedly returned to her abuser more than the victim about whom there is no such information. Further, participants with greater domestic violence myths tended to blame the victim more than those with less myths, and male participants blamed the victim and minimized the incident more than female participants. Implications, limitations of the study, and future research are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

The Effect of Intimate Partner Violence on Mental Health Status Among Women of Reproductive Ages: A Population-Based Study in a Middle Anatolian City

Author: Nur, Naim11 Cumhuriyet University, Sivas, Turkey

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705468?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence against women has been recognized as both a major public health problem and a human rights violation worldwide. Research has documented the association between physical/sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) and mental health, measured by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) among women in reproductive age. This study underlines that different types of IPV is independently associated with mental health status. Results also show effects of IPV on mental health may not only be immediate but also be long term. These findings suggest that efforts to identify women with mental health problems should include screening for the types and history of IPV victimization.

Self-Protective Behaviors and Injury in Domestic Violence Situations: Does It hurt to Fight Back

Author: Powers, Rachael A1; Simpson, Sally S1 University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364701511?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research examining the impact of self-protective behaviors on outcomes in nonsexual assaults involving intimates has focused solely on one mainstream sample (National Crime Victimization Survey) in which violence is a relatively rare event. Using the Women's Experience of Violence (WEV) project which collects data from a sample of incarcerated women, we explored the phenomenon of self-protective behaviors to assess whether their use impacts the probability and severity of subsequent injury during a domestic violence incident. In addition to utilizing a unique sample, we considered an alternative operationalization of self-protective behaviors that separates physical and verbal responses to include whether the behavior involved an element of force. Results suggest some similarities between a mainstream sample and our marginalized sample. Namely, the frequency in which they utilize countermeasures and the effect of "fighting back" appear to be consistent with previous research. However, the more nuanced categorization of self-protective behaviors demonstrates the importance of considering whether the strategy was forceful when examining women's responses to violence.

Social Norms for Intimate Partner Violence in Situations Involving Victim Infidelity

Author: Witte, Tricia H1; Mulla, Mazheruddin M1 Birmingham-Southern College, Birmingham, AL, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1270182438?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study investigated perceived descriptive norms (i.e., perceived prevalence) for male-to-female intimate partner violence (IPV) following victim infidelity (i.e., girlfriend had sex with another man). While watching a video-taped vignette of a young, dating couple in an argument that escalated to male-to-female violence, male participants were asked various questions to assess perceived descriptive norms at several time points during the escalating argument. Half of the participants were told that the victim in the video was unfaithful. Results suggested that while participants did believe that it was much more common for their male friends and for typical male students to aggress against unfaithful girlfriends compared to faithful girlfriends, these differences were less pronounced as the aggression intensified. When testing whether perceived norms for IPV were related to participants' purported risk of engaging in IPV, a clear pattern appeared: For the no-infidelity condition, IPV perceived norms for male friends and perceived norms for typical male students were each significantly related to participants' likelihood of engaging in IPV, such that the higher the estimated norm, the higher the participants' risk. However, for the infidelity condition, only perceived norms for male friends were related to the risk of engaging in IPV. Findings have important implications for social norms-based intervention and prevention programs for IPV on college campuses.

Intimate Partner Violence and Belief Systems in Liberia

Author: Allen, Mary1; Devitt, Catherine1 University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705216?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence is endemic in parts of the African continent. A small scale survey (n = 229) was conducted in 2009 in Northern Liberia, West Africa, to determine the prevalence and nature of intimate partner violence, and the cultural beliefs and gender norms that underpin respondent experiences and views towards intimate partner violence. Results show widespread experience of intimate partner violence among the respondent group, including physical abuse, sexual and verbal, and economic abuse. Acceptance of the situation was identified by most respondents as a way of responding to violence, and arises from the lack of financial and legal supports for women within the community. Despite the range of abuses experienced, beliefs about the power position of men in Liberian society provide evidence to reflect the predominance of certain cultural beliefs in framing respondents' perceptions of gender relations. The article concludes with a discussion on the possible impact of Liberia's recent conflict in contributing to the perpetuation and normalization of intimate partner violence. Further large scale research in this area is required. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Relationships Between Maternal Emotion Regulation, Parenting, and Children's Executive Functioning in Families Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Samuelson, Kristin W1; Krueger, Casey E; Wilson, Christina1 Alliant International University, San Francisco, CA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364701434?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recently researchers have begun to explore the extent to which children's cognitive development is influenced by experiences in the family environment. Assessing mother-child dyads exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV), a population at risk for emotional and neurocognitive problems, we examined relationships between maternal emotional regulation, parenting, and children's executive functioning (including working memory, inhibitory control, cognitve flexibility and set shifting, and planning). Positive parenting practices, as reported by the children, were correlated with children's planning and problem solving performance. Controlling for children's own emotion regulation and gender, mothers' self-reported emotion regulation abilities predicted children's performance on a task of cognitive flexibility. Girls exhibited superior emotion regulation and executive functioning performance compared to boys, and mothers of girls reported better emotion regulation abilities compared to mothers of boys. These findings add to a nascent literature suggesting that parenting and parental emotional functioning may play important roles in children's neurocognitive functioning. In addition, they help to explain the mechanisms by which children exposed to IPV experience executive functioning deficits. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Women's Early Relational Experiences That Lead to Domestic Violence

Author: Keeling, June1; Fisher, Colleen1 University of Chester, Chester, United Kingdom

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322723676?accountid=14925

Abstract: Many perpetrators of domestic violence engage in a perpetual cycle of forming sequential relationships while repeating violent behavior. Their methods of manipulation successfully dominate a partner, the outcome of the relationship being control and violence. This research study was influenced by a feminist standpoint epistemology, and was focused on the narratives of 15 women who chose to talk in great detail about the transition in their respective relationship from love to violence. The findings revealed three tactics, termed the princess effect, feeling vulnerable, and commitment, which were deployed by male perpetrators in the early stages of a relationship. The purpose of these tactics was to successfully engage and retain women, to then exert control, inflict violence, and subjugate them. A description of the initial act of physical violence is provided, revealing the impact of these tactics in meeting the ends intended by the perpetrator.

The Supportive Process for Ending Intimate Partner Violence After Pregnancy: The Experience of Nicaraguan Women

Author: Salazar, Mariano1; Hogberg, Ulf; Valladares, Eliette; Oehman, Ann1 Center for Demography and Health Research, Nicaraguan National Autonomous University, Leon, Nicaragua, Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Epidemiology and Global Health, Umea University, Sweden

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1431794104?accountid=14925

Abstract: This grounded theory study found that Nicaraguan mothers exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy eventually acted to protect their children and themselves. They experienced ending abuse as an empowerment process characterized by a cognitive change in women's attitudes toward partner abuse and the emergence of help-seeking strategies that lead to ending violence with or without ending the relationship. This process was facilitated by a supportive environment that challenged abusive behaviors as well as being asked about abuse during their last pregnancy. Although environmental changes can facilitate ending abuse, Nicaragua's public institutions must be strengthened to reach women in need.

Recovery: Resilience and Growth in the Aftermath of Domestic Violence

Author: Anderson, Kim M1; Renner, Lynette M; Danis, Fran S1 University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1431803158?accountid=14925

Abstract: This mixed-methods study explored the recovery process and outcomes for 37 women formerly in an abusive intimate partner relationship. Standardized measures of current psychosocial functioning indicated participants were largely asymptomatic for posttraumatic stress disorder and had relatively strong resilience. Qualitative analysis revealed how social and spiritual support was instrumental to participants' recovery, growth, and resilience. Implications for helping professionals include gaining a more comprehensive understanding of recovery from domestic violence. This type of knowledge may contribute to interventions that build on women's strengths and resourcefulness.

Sexual Victimization and Family Violence Among Urban African American Adolescent Women: Do Violence Cluster Profiles Predict Partner Violence Victimization and Sex Trade Exposure?

Author: Kennedy, Angie C1; Bybee, Deborah; Kulkarni, Shanti J; Archer, Gretchen1 School of Social Work, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494300414?accountid=14925

Abstract: Guided by an intersectional feminist perspective, we examined sexual victimization, witnessing intimate partner violence (IPV) in the family, and familial physical abuse among a sample of 180 urban African American adolescent women. We used cluster analysis to better understand the profiles of cumulative victimization, and the relationships between profiles and IPV victimization and personal exposure to the sex trade. Just under one third of the sample reported sexual victimization, with cooccurrence with both forms of family violence common. The cluster profile with high levels of severe family violence was associated with the highest rate of IPV victimization and sex trade exposure.

Risk and Protective Factors for Physical and Emotional Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in a Community of Lima, Peru

Author: Mayorga, Magaly Noblega11 Universidad de San Martin de Porres, Lima, Peru

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1316509280?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article shows risk and protective factors for both physical and emotional intimate partner violence (IPV) against women. The study was carried out in a shanty town of Lima, Peru, which has a strong community organization. One hundred ninety-two women between 25 and 59 years old (M = 34.09, SD = 6.5) were interviewed; 44.3% had secondary education, 75.5% were housewives, and 94% lived with their partner. The measurement instrument was a survey especially developed for this project to explore occurrence of physical and emotional IPV and to identify factors associated with them; factors were classified in individual and relational levels according to the ecological nested model (ENM). A logistic regression analysis was used to test the associations; the results showed that for emotional IPV, men's assertiveness was a protective factor, whereas their emotional instability and jealousy were risk factors. For physical IPV, there were no identified risks or protective factors. These results are presented and discussed.

Who Gets Blamed for Intimate Partner Violence? The Relative Contributions of Perpetrator Sex Category, Victim Confrontation, and Observer Attitudes

Author: Stewart, Cindy1; Moore, Todd; Crone, Travis; DeFreitas, Stacie Craft; Rhatigan, Deborah1 University of Houston-Downtown, Houston, TX, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705529?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study examined the effects of perpetrator sex category, victim confrontation, observer sex category, and observer attitudes on attributions of blame and behavioral stability for partner violence. Data were collected from 728 college-aged students enrolled at 2 universities in the United States. Results demonstrated that males and females attributed less blame and behavioral stability to female perpetrators than male perpetrators, especially if the perpetrator was provoked. Moreover, attitudes toward women and violence were important for predicting attributions, and some of the evidence for observer effects was reduced to nonsignificance once these variables were added to the model.

Dating Violence Policy: Making the Grade

Author: Hoefer, Richard1; Black, Beverly; Salehin, Mashooq1 Roy E. Dulak Professor for Community Practice Research, School of Social Work, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019 rhoefer@uta.edu

Abstract: Dating violence rates affect an unacceptably high percentage of youth. This paper tests a model to understand the considerable variation in state dating violence policy comprehensiveness. Independent variables in the model are state political culture, partisan control of political institutions, prevalence of dating violence, and median household income. Bivariate results show partial support for preliminary hypotheses. Regression analysis indicates that strength of Democratic Party control of governmental institutions is the only variable in the model that achieved statistical significance. Implications and recommendations for future research are provided. Adapted from the source document.

Indeterminate Responses to Attitudinal Questions About Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Rural Bangladesh

Author: Yount, Kathryn M1; Halim, Nafisa; Head, Sara; Schuler, Sidney Ruth1 Hubert Department of Global Health and Department of Sociology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA, kyount@emory.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1316439001?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using data from 165 participants in a survey experiment in six Bangladeshi villages, we explored the levels and correlates of women's indeterminate responses to a five-part attitudinal question on intimate partner violence (IPV) against women from the 2007 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. Over 80 % had indeterminate responses to all five parts of the question. Indeterminate responses included silence or initial non-response (53-58 %), misunderstanding the question (30-37 %), and conditional opinions (7-13 %). The percentages of women who justified IPV were lower when indeterminate responses were permitted (7-12 %) than when they were not (37-57 %). Older women ( greater than or equal to 26 years) with less schooling ( less than or equal to 2 grades) whose husbands were older ( greater than or equal to 36 years), had less schooling ( less than or equal to 8 grades), and were at least 7 years older than the respondent often had higher odds of giving indeterminate responses. Husbands' attributes and spousal age gaps were most consistently associated with women's indeterminate responses. Latent power, or fears of expressing transgressive views, may underlie women's indeterminate responses to attitudinal questions about IPV against women. Recommendations for further research are discussed.

Abstract: Japanese women suffer domestic violence by their significant male other but by cultural tradition lack the necessary support which relegates in myth. Members of the Japanese community both at home and abroad are no exception. Domestic violence in Japan is in fact committed for purposes of control by one partner of the other. Subsequently domestic violence is a problem which appears non-existent in the Japanese community at the expense of its victims. Real life contradictions, pertaining to domestic violence events among the Japanese are sustained not only by tradition but limited discourse as well. Therefore, accounts of domestic violence among the Japanese necessitate investigation of the pathology where it occurs regardless of culture, shame or demographic category.

Intimate Partner Violence in Colombia: Who Is at Risk?

Author: Friedemann-Sanchez, Greta1; Lovaton, Rodrigo1 University of Minnesota

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1315600923?accountid=14925

Abstract: The role that domestic violence plays in perpetuating poverty is often overlooked as a development issue. Using data from the 2005 Demographic Health Survey, this paper examines the prevalence of intimate partner violence in Colombia. Employing an intrahousehold bargaining framework and a bivariate probit model, it assesses the prevalence of and risk factors for physical and emotional intimate partner violence, including such variables as income, education, gender-based intrahousehold decision making, employment, migration related to armed conflict and child maltreatment. The findings of the study particularly underscore the effects of early childhood maltreatment on domestic violence and the need for policy measures that span the life cycle and include families. Its recommendations for policy makers and researchers take into consideration practical, theoretical and methodological issues. Adapted from the source document.

Making Sense of Intimate Partner Violence in Late Life: Comments From Online News Readers

Author: Brossoie, Nancy; Roberto, Karen A; Barrow, Katie M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554417?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to gain insight into public awareness of intimate partner violence (IPV) in late life by how individuals respond to incidents of IPV reported in the newspaper. Using grounded theory techniques, online news items covering 24 incidents of IPV in late life, and the reader comments posted to them were analyzed. The news items were examined for incident details, story framing, and reporting style. An open coding process (Charmaz, K. [2006]. Constructing grounded theory: A practical guide through qualitative analysis. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.) was used to generate a comprehensive understanding of themes and patterns in the comments posted by readers. Few posters indicated that incidents were episodes of IPV. As many posters struggled to make sense of incidents, they attempted to remove guilt from the perpetrator by assigning blame elsewhere. Comments were influenced by personal assumptions and perspectives about IPV, relationships, and old age; reporting style of the news items; and comments posted by other posters. Altering public views of IPV in late life requires raising awareness through education, reframing the ways in which information is presented, and placing greater emphasis on the context of the violence. By engaging interactive news media, reporters, participatory journalists, and policymakers can enhance public recognition and understanding of IPV in late life. Adapted from the source document.

The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Low-Income Women's Economic Well-Being: The Mediating Role of Job Stability

Author: Adams, Adrienne E1; Tolman, Richard M; Bybee, Deborah; Sullivan, Cris M; Kennedy, Angie C1 Department of Psychology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1431808487?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study sought to extend our understanding of the mechanisms by which intimate partner violence (IPV) harms women economically. We examined the mediating role of job instability on the IPV-economic well-being relationship among 503 welfare recipients. IPV had significant negative effects on women's job stability and economic well-being. Job stability was at least partly responsible for the deleterious economic consequences of IPV, and the effects lasted up to three years after the IPV ended. This study demonstrates the need for services and policies that address barriers to employment as a means of improving the economic well-being of low-income women with abusive partners.

Abstract: Research from Rakai, Uganda, suggests intimate partner violence (IPV) is common and attitudes condoning it are widespread. We used a public health approach to develop and implement an evidence-based IPV prevention intervention named the Safe Homes and Respect for Everyone (SHARE) Project. SHARE was designed on the Transtheoretical Model of behavior change and adapted IPV prevention strategies from Raising Voices and Stepping Stones. SHARE was implemented in four regions of Rakai. This article describes the design and implementation of SHARE, provides details on strategies and activities used, discusses challenges and lessons learned, and provides recommendations for other violence prevention programmers.

Clinical and Mental Health Correlates and Risk Factors for Intimate Partner Violence among HIV-Positive Women in an Inner-City HIV Clinic

Author: Illangasekare, Samantha; Tello, Monique; Hutton, Heidi; Moore, Richard; Anderson, Jean; Baron, Jillian; Chander, Geetanjali

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1373430377?accountid=14925

Abstract: Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious health concern for women in the United States, and HIV-positive women experience more frequent and severe abuse compared with HIV-negative women. The goals of this study were to determine the prevalence of IPV among HIV-infected women receiving care in an urban clinic and to determine the HIV clinical and mental health correlates of IPV among HIV-positive women. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 196 women visiting an inner-city HIV clinic. Women were eligible if they were 18 years of age or older, English speaking, and received both HIV primary and gynecologic care at the clinic. The survey queried demographics, drug and alcohol history, depressive symptoms, and IPV, using the Partner Violence Scale. Antiretroviral therapy (ART), CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, and appointment adherence were abstracted from clinical records. Findings: Overall, 26.5% of women reported experiencing IPV in the past year. There were no differences in sociodemographics, substance use, ART prescription, CD4 count, or HIV-1 RNA level between women who experienced IPV and those who had not. Women with mild and severe depressive symptoms were significantly more likely to report IPV compared with those without, with adjusted odds ratios of 3.4 and 5.5, respectively. Women who missed gynecologic appointments were 1.9 times more likely to report experiencing IPV. Conclusions: IPV is prevalent among women presenting for HIV care, and depressive symptoms or missed gynecologic appointments should prompt further screening for IPV.

'Until People Are Given the Right to Be Human Again': Voices of American Indian Men on Domestic Violence and Traditional Cultural Values

Author: Matamonasa-Bennett, Arieahn

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1531931951?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence is a serious social problem in contemporary American Indian communities and has been identified by the National Congress of American Indians as one of the most important issues facing American Indians now and in the future. Examining domestic violence in American Indian communities is critically important for the creation and evaluation of prevention and intervention strategies to prevent further suffering of its victims. Here, Matamonasa-Bennett tries to discover the perspectives and cultural dynamics of men from a single cultural community representing different generations who had reported experiences with domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

Aboriginal Women's Perceptions and Experiences of a Family Violence Transitional Accommodation Service

Author: Wendt, Sarah; Baker, Joanne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1542000993?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents a qualitative study of Aboriginal women's perceptions and experiences of a transitional housing program in South Australia that was established to assist long-term homelessness and family violence. The aim of the study was to explore the experiences and service outcomes for Aboriginal women and their children and to identify both facilitators and barriers to the effective operation of the program. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 13 Aboriginal women and thematic analysis was used to report their collective stories. The women's stories showed individualised, flexible, and open-ended support as well as practical outcomes of stable, safe housing for themselves and their children were particularly valued. The women reported that these features of the program augmented feelings of strengthened confidence and self-efficacy. The authors argue the domestic and family violence sector has the opportunity to learn from the perceptions and experiences of Aboriginal women, particularly allowing time and commitment to working long-term with families. 13.

The Intimate Partner Violence Stigmatization Model and Barriers to Help Seeking

Author: Overstreet, Nicole M1; Quinn, Diane M1 Yale University nicole.overstreet@yale.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705044?accountid=14925

Abstract: The intimate partner violence (IPV) stigmatization model identifies how three stigma components hinder IPV help-seeking behaviors: cultural stigma, stigma internalization, and anticipated stigma. Cultural stigma highlights societal beliefs that delegitimize people experiencing abuse. Stigma internalization involves the extent to which people come to believe that the negative stereotypes about those who experience IPV may be true of themselves. Anticipated stigma emphasizes concern about what will happen once others know about the partner abuse (e.g., rejection). We provide an integrative literature review that supports the IPV stigmatization model and its role in reducing help-seeking behaviors. Adapted from the source document.

Laying Down the Family Burden: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Resilience in the Midst of Family Violence

Author: Kassis, Wassilis1; Artz, Sibylle; Moldenhauer, Stephanie1 School of Educational Sciences, University of Osnabrueck, Osnabrueck, Germany wkassis@uos.de

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417520805?accountid=14925

Abstract: Questionnaire data from a cross-sectional study of a randomly selected sample of 5,149 middle-school students from four EU countries (Austria, Germany, Slovenia, and Spain) were used to explore the effects of family violence burden level, structural and procedural risk and protective factors, and personal characteristics on adolescents who are resilient to depression and aggression despite being exposed to domestic violence. Using logistic regression to identify resilience characteristics, our results indicate that structural risks like one's sex, migration experience, and socioeconomic status were not predictive of either family violence burden levels or resilience. Rather, nonresilience to family violence is derived from a combination of negative experiences with high levels of family violence in conjunction with inconsistent parenting, verbally aggressive teachers, alcohol and drug misuse and experiences of indirect aggression with peers. Overall, negative factors outweigh positive factors and play a greater role in determining the resilience level that a young person achieves. Adapted from the source document.

Sexual and dating violence among adolescents and young adults in Chile: a review of findings from a survey of university students

Author: Lehrer, Jocelyn A1; Lehrer, Evelyn L; Koss, Mary P1 Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health, University of California, San Francisco, USA jlehrer1@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429640048?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper synthesises and discusses results from the 2005 Survey of Student Well-Being, a closed-ended questionnaire administered to students attending general education courses at a major public university in Santiago (n = 484 women, 466 men). The survey included questions on sexual violence (SV) and dating violence (DV), public health problems that have received little attention in Chile and other Latin-American countries. This paper highlights key findings from a series of papers based on these data, noting lessons learned in the Chilean context that may be useful for other Latin-American countries. Important gaps in the international literature on SV and DV are also discussed. A central finding is the high prevalence of SV and DV in this sample of university students, warranting further public health attention to these problems. Potentially, the findings will contribute to changes in awareness, policy and practice along similar lines to efforts that transformed the US landscape regarding SV and DV on college campuses in the 1980s. Adapted from the source document.

Family violence towards the elderly in Spain

Author: Ibanez, Jorge Gracia11 Laboratorio de Sociologia Juridica, Facultad de Derecho, C/Pedro Cerbuna, 12, 50009 Zaragoza, Espagne jgraiba@unizar.es

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417527139?accountid=14925

Abstract: After a brief review of key elements in the theoretical and conceptual framework about elder abuse, the methodology, main results and conclusions of a study about family violence against the elderly people are reported. Applying socio-legal analysis, some questions about the social, legal and institutional response to family elder abuse in Spain and the Comunidad Autonoma of Aragon are discussed. This is a kind of aging people's human rights violation that still remains socially hidden, understudied, and generally speaking poorly tackled in social and domestic violence prevention policies. Adapted from the source document.

Civil Legal Services and Domestic Violence: Missed Service Opportunities

Author: Hartley, Carolyn Copps; Renner, Lynette M; Mackel, Shellie

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704982?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence can have a negative effect on multiple areas of a woman's life. While much focus has been on criminal legal interventions for domestic violence, civil legal services can provide a unique constellation of responses to the needs of women who experience domestic violence, which may be unfamiliar to many social workers. Civil legal services can greatly improve a woman's circumstances when targeting material needs such as housing, employment, and economic conditions. This article describes the differences in focus and impact of criminal and civil legal interventions for domestic violence, provides an in-depth illustration of how civil legal services can address a myriad of needs for women who experience domestic violence, and addresses the role social workers can play in assisting clients in the civil legal process. Adapted from the source document.

Validation of a Measure of Intimate Partner Abuse (Relationship Behavior Rating Scale-Revised) Using Item Response Theory Analysis

Author: Beck, Connie J A1; Menke, J Michael; Figueredo, Aurelio Jose1 Department of Psychology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA beck@u.arizona.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429630314?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is a need for a screening instrument to provide insight into intimate partner abuse (IPA) to inform legal decisions in child custody, divorce, child welfare, and criminal cases. This study is the third validation of the Relationship Behavior Rating Scale-Revised (RBRS-R) for concurrent validity with the widely used Conflict Tactics Scales 2 (CTS2). Item response theory results show that the RBRS-R compares favorably to the CTS, but also provides a higher degree of resolution than the CTS2 with respect to additional elements of IPA that can be manifested in different situations or individuals. This additional information might be very important in determining the safest legal process (mediation versus traditional litigation) and appropriate case outcomes to protect victims of violence. Adapted from the source document.

Practitioner Perspectives of the Economic Coping Experiences of Women of Domestic Violence Abuse

Author: Haeseler, Lisa Ann11 Community Outreach Consultant, Leadership Headquarters, Angola, New York, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554423?accountid=14925

Abstract: Through this case study the author investigates women's coping experiences with economic challenges in the spectrum of domestic violence abuse. Women of abuse cope with financial difficulties compounded by other ecologically contributing factors. Eight non-abused, social service practitioners from four different agencies, two providers per agency, described the economic coping experiences of women of abuse they serve. Comprehensive and interdisciplinary care is necessary to meet women's multifaceted, complex economic needs. Study results corroborate with research. Service delivery of care for women of abuse coping with family, schooling, and economic hardships are enhanced through schools and service agencies working together, collaborating networking, and sharing of resources in order to better advocate for women and children.

Themes of Coping in the Spectrum of Domestic Violence Abuse: A Review of the Literature

Author: Haeseler, Lisa Ann11 Community Outreach Consultant, Leadership Headquarters, Angola, New York, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554206?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women's coping experiences in the spectrum of domestic violence abuse are complex and multifaceted. The spectrum stages of abuse include when a woman is in, out, or returning to the abuse situation. In this article the author discusses the obstacles with which women cope and the service delivery initiatives to better serve women. The themes of women's coping in the spectrum of abuse for this research review include psycho-physiological, economic, education, family, and childcare factors. Service practitioners must fully recognize the factors with which women of abuse cope. Included are suggestions for service professionals aiding women to improve services as women utilize multiple services simultaneously. Adapted from the source document.

Women's Coping Experiences in the Spectrum of Domestic Violence Abuse

Author: Haeseler, Lisa Ann11 Community Outreach Consultant, Leadership Headquarters, Angola, New York, USA

Abstract: Through this phenomenological case study the author investigates the experience of coping by women in the spectrum of domestic violence abuse. An ecological view of women's coping is critically reviewed. Women of abuse cope with many factors simultaneously in their lives as there are numerous, multifaceted, and diverse issues that comprise and contribute to an abusive situation. Eight providers from four different agencies, two providers per agency, describe the coping experiences of women both in and out of the abusive situation. Study results corroborate with research and demonstrate that women's coping, both in and out of the abusive relationship is unique and complex. Adapted from the source document.

Experiences of Marriage and Family Therapists Working with Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Karakurt, Gunnur1; Dial, Shannon; Korkow, Hannah; Mansfield, Ty; Banford, Alyssa1 Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364701940?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of our study was to explore the experiences of marriage and family therapists in working with violent couples. In particular, we focused on therapists' questions and feelings of competency pertaining to violence assessment and treatment, the difficulties they face during their practices, and the factors that affect their practice. Data for this study were collected via a focus group that lasted approximately 1 hour. The participants included five marriage and family therapists. A set of questions were used to explore experiences of therapists who were working with clients who are experiencing domestic violence. The research team recorded the answers to these questions as well as associated discussion. A grounded theory approach was used to analyze the data. Six themes were derived from the coded data: acknowledgment and reliance on systemic foundations, therapist factors, assessment, treatment considerations, sex of batterers, and training in marriage and family therapy programs. Adapted from the source document.

Use of a Social-Ecological Framework to Understand How and Under What Conditions Family Violence Exposure Affects Children's Adjustment

Author: Low, Sabina1; Mulford, Carrie1 School of Social and Family Dynamics, Arizona State University, P.O. Box 873701, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA Sabina.low@asu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1373429895?accountid=14925

Abstract: The proportion of children experiencing violence in the home is disturbingly high, with many also being victims of violence outside the home. Therefore, smaller, innovative or preliminary studies were invited in order to better understand how exposure to violence across different ecologies independently or interactively influences the risk for maladaptive outcomes. This special issue is predicated on the notion that risk for maladaptive outcomes is contextualized by one's individual traits (e.g., self-regulatory capacities), characteristics of the abuse (e.g., duration), exposure to multiple forms of violence (both within and outside the home), as well as parenting and familial resources (e.g., parents' mental health and abuse history, familial social support). Two of the articles focus on dual victimization in the home, two address factors that modify the relation between child sexual abuse and adjustment, and the last two articles focus on mediators of the relationship between abuse or exposure to IPV and adjustment. Taken together, these articles reflect efforts at elucidating modifiable targets for prevention and intervention purposes, as well as qualities of the individual, family, or the abuse that may aid in tailoring interventions to be maximally effective. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Risk for Child Neglect during Early Childhood in a Community Sample of Fragile Families

Author: Nicklas, Eric1; Mackenzie, Michael J1 Columbia University School of Social Work, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY, 10025, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1373429999?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study explores the relationship between child neglect and intimate partner violence (IPV) in a longitudinal community sample of 1,740 families with young children, with a special focus on the association between specific typologies of both neglect behaviors and IPV. We focused on families followed across early childhood, because infants and toddlers are at the greatest risk of exposure to neglect (the most prevalent type of child maltreatment), and this period spanning the transition to parenthood presents heightened risk for IPV. We found evidence that coercive IPV is an important driver of the connections between IPV and subsequent neglect through affecting the mother's well-being and ability to provide basic care and nurturance. Implications for intervention and future work addressing definitions and pathways to neglect are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Exposure to Maternal- and Paternal-Perpetrated Intimate Partner Violence, Emotion Regulation, and Child Outcomes

Author: Harding, Hilary G1; Morelen, Diana; Thomassin, Kristel; Bradbury, Laura; Shaffer, Anne1 Department of Psychology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA hilary.harding@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1373430071?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study examined the relationship of maternal- and paternal-perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV) to children's internalizing and externalizing symptomatology. Mother-child dyads (N=53; child ages 8-11) reported maternal- and paternal-perpetrated IPV exposure and measures of child symptomatology. Results demonstrated that: (a) maternal- and paternal-perpetrated IPV have similar but not identical relations with child outcomes, (b) mothers' and children's reports of paternal-perpetrated IPV were positively related, (c) mother and child report of maternal- and paternal-perpetrated IPV related to child emotional and behavior problems, and (d) emotion dysregulation mediated the link between IPV exposure and child outcomes. Notably, findings differed by reporters. Results support emotion dysregulation as one mechanism through which IPV exposure may lead to child behavior problems, with implications for clinical intervention. Adapted from the source document.

Cognitive Mechanisms of the Transmission of Violence: Exploring Gender Differences among Adolescents Exposed to Family Violence

Author: Calvete, Esther1; Orue, Izaskun1 Department of Personality, Psychological Assessment and Treatment, University of Deusto, Apdo. 1, 48080, Bilbao, Spain, esther.calvete@deusto.es

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1320646968?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study focuses on the mechanisms through which exposure to family violence leads to aggressive behavior in adolescents who were the victims of abuse and neglect. A sample of 166 adolescents from residential child welfare and protection centers for victims of abuse and neglect completed measures of victimization and witnessing violence at home, three schemas (justification of violence, mistrust, and grandiosity), aggressiveness (proactive and reactive), and depression. The results showed that witnessing family violence is more intensely associated with aggressiveness than victimization, and that part of this association is mediated by schemas of justification of violence and grandiosity. Victimization was associated with less aggressiveness and more depression, through the schema of mistrust. In girls exposure to family violence was more intensely associated with aggressiveness.

Behavioral and Attitudinal Factors Differentiating Male Intimate Partner Violence Perpetrators With and Without a History of Childhood Family Violence

Author: Lee, Rosalyn D1; Walters, Mikel L; Hall, Jeffrey E; Basile, Kathleen C1 Division of Violence Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1373430045?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study utilized a sample of men (N=340) charged with assault against a female partner to assess differences among IPV perpetrators with and without a history of childhood family violence on factors such as angry, controlling and violent behaviors, substance use related behaviors, and attitudes towards women. Over two-thirds of the sample reported childhood exposure to maltreatment or witnessing IPV. Chi-square analyses and t-tests indicated significant differences between perpetrators with and without a history of family violence on eight of eleven measures. Findings suggest perpetrators with a family violence history more strongly endorse ideas that present women and feminine attributes in a negative light. This research demonstrates that while exposure to family violence during childhood is not necessary for IPV to occur, its presence may be a marker for more severe attitudinal and behavioral problems. Findings highlight the need for primary prevention efforts and can inform secondary prevention strategies. Adapted from the source document.

Lifting the Domestic Violence Cloak of Silence: Resilient Australian Women's Reflected Memories of their Childhood Experiences of Witnessing Domestic Violence

Author: O'Brien, Kristy L1; Cohen, Lynne; Pooley, Julie Ann; Taylor, Myra F1 Lifespan Resilience Research Group, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1373430141?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recognition is growing that childhood witnessing of domestic violence is tantamount to child abuse due to the damage the experience may have on the witnessing child's long-term emotional and social wellbeing. This paper helps to lift the cloak of silence that surrounds the child witnessing phenomenon by presenting the recollected adult memories of six female former child witnesses. Utilizing a mixed case-study and consensual qualitative research design, the study's findings reveal that the potential threat to a child witness's immediate and long-term wellbeing can be mediated through the progressive development of a range of adaptive coping strategies. Of these, the strategy of establishing a safe place and a supportive relationship outside of the abusive nuclear family home seems pivotal to the witnessing child's resilient ability to move on and lead a 'rewarding' adult life. The paper closes with a discussion on how the research findings can be progressed. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Reported by Lesbian-, Gay-, and Bisexual-Identified Individuals Living in Canada: An Exploration of Within-Group Variations

Author: Barrett, Betty Jo1; St Pierre, Melissa1 University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada bbarrett@uwindsor.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417523710?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although research has examined intimate partner violence (IPV) within lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) communities, contradictory evidence exists regarding variations in IPV within this diverse population. Using data from a nationally representative Canadian survey, we examined differences in rates and severity of LGB IPV based on sexual orientation, gender, sociodemographic factors, and previous experiences of discrimination. Individuals who were bisexual, younger, currently single, less educated, and who experienced physical/mental limitations were more likely to experience IPV. Compared to gays and lesbians, bisexuals reported more incidents of violence and higher rates of injury. Implications for research and theory development are provided. Adapted from the source document.

Effect of Type and Severity of Intimate Partner Violence on Women's Health and Service Use: Findings From a Primary Care Trial of Women Afraid of Their Partners

Author: Hegarty, Kelsey L1; O'Doherty, Lorna J; Chondros, Patty; Valpied, Jodie; Taft, Angela J; Astbury, Jill; Brown, Stephanie J; Gold, Lisa; Taket, Ann; Feder, Gene S; Gunn, Jane M1 The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) has major affects on women's wellbeing. There has been limited investigation of the association between type and severity of IPV and health outcomes. This article describes socio-demographic characteristics, experiences of abuse, health, safety, and use of services in women enrolled in the Women's Evaluation of Abuse and Violence Care (WEAVE) project. We explored associations between type and severity of abuse and women's health, quality of life, and help seeking. Women (aged 16-50 years) attending 52 Australian general practices, reporting fear of partners in last 12 months were mailed a survey between June 2008 and May 2010. Response rate was 70.5% (272/386). In the last 12 months, one third (33.0%) experienced Severe Combined Abuse, 26.2% Physical and Emotional Abuse, 26.6% Emotional Abuse and/or Harassment only, 2.7% Physical Abuse only and 12.4% scored negative on the Composite Abuse Scale. A total of 31.6% of participants reported poor or fair health and 67.9% poor social support. In the last year, one third had seen a psychologist (36.6%) or had 5 or more general practitioner visits (34.3%); 14.7% contacted IPV services; and 24.4% had made a safety plan. Compared to other abuse groups, women with Severe Combined Abuse had poor quality of life and mental health, despite using more medications, counseling, and IPV services and were more likely to have days out of role because of emotional issues. In summary, women who were fearful of partners in the last year, have poor mental health and quality of life, attend health care services frequently, and domestic violence services infrequently. Those women experiencing severe combined physical, emotional, and sexual abuse have poorer quality of life and mental health than women experiencing other abuse types. Health practitioners should take a history of type and severity of abuse for women with mental health issues to assist access to appropriate specialist support.

Abstract: Intimate partner violence, including threats, stalking, emotional, physical, and sexual assault by a spouse or partner, has significant influences on the well-being of women of all racial and social backgrounds. This study of a nationally representative sample of women from varying racial and ethnic groups examined specific types of violent acts on health and well-being. An association between intimate partner violence and poor physical and mental health was found. Types of partner violence also had different associations with the well-being of women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Social and demographic factors played an important role in moderating women's outcomes. Suggestions for future studies are discussed.

Adolescent Beliefs About the Acceptability of Dating Violence: Does Violent Behavior Change Them

Author: Mueller, Victoria1; Jouriles, Ernest N; McDonald, Renee; Rosenfield, David1 Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704545?accountid=14925

Abstract: This longitudinal study examined the interplay between teens' beliefs about the acceptability of dating violence and dating violence perpetration. The final sample included 82 teens aged 14 to 17 years. Families were recruited from truancy courts and juvenile probation and victim services offices. Teens participated in a baseline and a follow-up assessment spaced 3 months apart. At each assessment, teens reported on their beliefs about dating violence acceptability and their dating violence perpetration. Dating violence perpetration at baseline predicted beliefs accepting of violence at follow-up, after accounting for baseline levels of beliefs. Beliefs at baseline, however, did not predict dating violence perpetration at follow-up. Dating violence perpetration may lead to beliefs more accepting of such violence.

Internet access and use in domestic violence shelters: Policy, capacity, and management barriers

Author: Westbrook, Lynn

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1373429166?accountid=14925

Abstract: Summary: Domestic violence agency administrators struggle to incorporate the Internet safely and effectively into their intimate partner violence (IPV) services. This study utilizes two data gathering tools to identify administrative concerns and web content in the 91 Texas shelters. The first research stage employed a mixed-methods questionnaire (89% response rate) to identify managers' Internet use patterns and managerial needs. In the second stage, all shelter web sites (65) were submitted to a multi-context content analysis. Findings: Overall, findings indicate that administrators see a serious need for basic administrative support tools (e.g. policies and training materials) and the development of cyber-safety resources (e.g. online stalking tips). Administrators view the Internet's potential for increasing staff efficiency and clients' sense of self-efficacy as worthwhile. Questionnaire findings indicate that 66 percent of directors need a means of helping clients learn to do their own information-seeking, only 54 percent have a written policy, and 46 percent have no in-house training at all. Web site findings indicate that 61 percent of the sites lacked minimal cyber-safety information despite administrative concerns about cyber-stalking. Applications: IPV shelter administrators' two Internet utility criteria, service priorities and resources, privilege implementation barriers and ignore the embedded expectations of communication and resource support. By shifting from a shelter-based Internet perspective to a user-generated perspective, administrators can integrate clients' expectations with the shelter's options. The resultant conceptual framework for Internet integration posits the lived information experience as managers' basis for shaping social communication, resource generation, information seeking, and decision-making.

Using Standardized Clients to Train Social Workers in Intimate Partner Violence Assessment

Author: Forgey, Mary Ann; Badger, Lee; Gilbert, Tracey; Hansen, Johna

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1542000864?accountid=14925

Abstract: Evidence-based assessment in intimate partner violence (IPV) is critical to the accurate understanding of risk and to the development of interventions that increase safety. In this study, standardized clients (actors) were used to train Army civilian social workers in evidence-based assessment of IPV and in the evaluation of the curriculum's effectiveness. Participation in this training curriculum increased the following: the participants' knowledge about the empirical basis for content areas explored in IPV assessment, their exploration of content critical to an IPV assessment interview, and their interviewing process skills. The results support the effectiveness of using standardized clients in IPV assessment training and evaluation. Adapted from the source document.

Covert Wars in the Bedroom and Nation: Motherwork, Transnationalism, and Domestic Violence in Black Widow's Wardrobe and Mother Tongue

Author: Johnson, Leigh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1373428600?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article argues that, as a tool for social justice and resistance, the concept of motherwork can be usefully applied to two texts by Chicana writers-Lucha Corpi's Black Widow's Wardrobe and Demetria Martinez's Mother Tongue. The essay draws on Patricia Hill Collins's theory of motherwork and survival for women of color to show how characters in the novels confront violence by doing motherwork. The article employs a transnational reading of the texts to argue that in this context domestic violence has a double meaning-that of the home and that of the nation. The article addresses motherwork generally, turns to hemispheric and transnational concerns, and concludes with a discussion of domestic violence and the motherwork that emerges in opposition to it.

Identifying the Barriers to Women's Agency in Domestic Violence: The Tensions between Women's Personal Experiences and Systemic Responses

Author: Aldridge, Jo

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1559005548?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite advances in knowledge and understanding about the impacts of domestic violence on women's lives, global research on violence against women shows there is a need for research that not only places women centre stage in research praxis, but also that involves them more collaboratively in genuine dialogue about their experiences, including their agentic stances. This is especially the case for marginalised and socially excluded women victims of domestic violence, such as those who are not known or do not present to services and who survive abusive relationships alone or with little outside support. Evidence from two studies reported here-secondary analysis of women with severe and enduring mental health problems and a collaborative narrative project with unsupported women victims of domestic violence-suggest that women's capacity for agency are compromised by a number of critical factors, and that these are also reflected in the tensions between micro-macro analyses and understanding of the impact of domestic violence on women. This article considers the barriers to women's agency from the women's perspective and in the context of broader, systemic dynamics, including the denial or obscuring of abuse by governments and states and the consequences of stringent fiscal retrenchment that put women at increased risk of domestic violence.

The Othering of Domestic Violence: The EU and Cultural Framings of Violence against Women

Author: Montoya, Celeste1; Agustin, Lise Rolandsen1 University of Colorado Boulder

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1622297488?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence against women is a universal problem, affecting women at all levels of society; however, differently situated women have unique experiences with violence. Theoretically, this calls for the necessity to balance universality with intersectionality. Analyzing EU policy texts, we argue that the recognition of different forms of violence has led to an increased tendency toward culturalization, i.e. articulating culture as the only explanation behind certain forms of violence or focusing exclusively on culturalized forms of violence. While largely ignoring the gendered nature of violence, cultural framings of violence also create a dichotomy between 'insiders' (non-violent Europeans) and 'outsiders' (violent others). Adapted from the source document.

Use of Mental Health Services by Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Edmond, Tonya1; Bowland, Sharon; Yu, Mansoo1 George Warren Brown School of Social Work, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1373429394?accountid=14925

Abstract: Fifty women survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) were recruited from a legal advocacy program to participate in a study designed to assess current rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and alcohol and substance abuse among a sample of abused women and to examine the types of services survivors of IPV had used in the previous 12 months. In addition, the authors sought to understand how the presence of substance abuse, PTSD, and/or depression affects access and utilization of services by IPV survivors. Fifty-four percent of these IPV survivors were experiencing either PTSD, clinical depression, or both. While women with either PTSD or depression used a significantly larger number of services overall, the majority had not used any mental health services, even though they frequently reported services were accessible. Given the high rates of PTSD and depression in this sample, these abused women were clearly not receiving adequate mental health care. Furthermore, many reported having trouble accessing housing, legal services, crisis lines, and medical care-services that are fundamental to safety. Practitioners working with abused women should assess for PTSD and depression, and be prepared to either treat each condition or provide effective referrals. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Substance Use Among Hawai'i Youth: An Analysis of Recent Data From the Hawai'i Youth Risk Behavior Survey

Author: Zaha, Rebecca1; Helm, Susana; Baker, Charlene; Hayes, Donald1 The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705012?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: This study explored the relationship between adolescent substance use and intimate partner violence (IPV). Method: A secondary data analysis was conducted using the statewide Hawai'i Youth Risk Behavior Survey data for the years 2005, 2007, and 2009. Public school students (n = 4,364) attending medium to large school districts in Hawai'i participated. Prevalence estimates and regression models of covariates were calculated. Results: Results indicated that IPV victimization and substance use are prevalent among Hawai'i youth. Odds ratio calculations indicated that substance use (specifically multiple drug use) is associated with an increased likelihood of reporting IPV victimization. Conclusions: Curricula and programming to prevent drug use among Hawai'i youth must incorporate IPV prevention, and vice versa. Adapted from the source document.

Birthplace, Culture, Self-Esteem, and Intimate Partner Violence Among Community-Dwelling Hispanic Women

Author: Gonzalez-Guarda, Rosa M1; Vermeesch, Amber L; Florom-Smith, Aubrey L; McCabe, Brian E; Peragallo, Nilda P1 University of Miami School of Nursing and Health Studies, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463028309?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to explore variations in demographics, culture, self-esteem, and intimate partner violence among Hispanic women according to birthplace, and to identify factors associated with these differences in intimate partner violence (IPV). Baseline data from a randomized control trial testing the efficacy of an HIV prevention program were used. Path analyses identified differences in IPV between Colombian women and women from other Central/South American countries. Self-esteem was the only factor associated with these differences. Interventions addressing the unique needs of Hispanic women from different subgroups are needed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Maternal Childhood Abuse, Intimate Partner Violence, and Child Psychopathology: The Mediator Role of Mothers' Mental Health

Author: Miranda, Jenniffer K1; de la Osa, Nuria; Granero, Roser; Ezpeleta, Lourdes1 Unit of Epidemiology and Diagnosis in Developmental Psychopathology, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463026391?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the mediator role of mothers' mental health in the relationship among maternal childhood abuse (CA), intimate partner violence (IPV), and offspring's psychopathology, and explored whether mediational pathways were moderated by children's sex. Participants were 327 Spanish outpatient children, 8 to 17 years old, and their mothers. Mothers' global psychological distress and depressive symptoms mediated the associations between mothers' violence history and children's externalizing problems. However, only depressive symptoms fully mediated these relationships. Children's sex did not have a moderating role in adjusted paths. Mothers' depressive symptoms are an important mechanism by which maternal violence experiences could affect externalizing problems in Spanish children.

Subjection, Subjectivity, and Agency: The Power, Meaning, and Practice of Mothering Among Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Abuse

Author: Semaan, Ingrid1; Jasinski, Jana L; Bubriski-McKenzie, Anne1 University of Connecticut, CT, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463024918?accountid=14925

Abstract: Drawing on in-depth interviews with mothers who were abused by intimate partners, we argue that mothering can be a source of empowerment that helps battered women both care for their children and survive and assert themselves. Women in the study sample described a violation of some aspect of their mothering as the reason they left their partners. However, narrative analysis exposed contradictions in participants' stories, revealing multiple factors that shaped their decisions to leave. Although motherhood was significant for the women who participated in the study, it was not their only motivation for ending their relationships with abusive partners.

Intimate Partner Violence and Mental Health Among Italian Adolescents: Gender Similarities and Differences

Author: Romito, Patrizia1; Beltramini, Lucia; Escriba-Agueir, Vicenta1 University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1320965784?accountid=14925

Abstract: Only a few studies have analyzed the health impact of intimate partner violence (IPV) on male and female adolescents, taking into account other kinds of violence that can affect their health. In this study, 43.7% of female adolescents and 34.8% of males reported IPV; females reported more psychological and sexual IPV, with no differences for physical IPV. Controlling for family and sexual violence and other confounding factors, female adolescents exposed to IPV had significantly higher adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for depression, panic attacks, eating problems, and suicidal ideation. For male adolescents, only the OR of eating problems almost reached statistical significance.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to describe sexual risk behavior among 239 couples during pregnancy and to examine the relationship of sexual risk behavior with HIV serostatus and intimate partner violence. One-third (31.8 %) of pregnant women and 20.9 % of male partners were HIV positive. HIV risk factors included lack of knowledge of partners' HIV serostatus, unprotected sexual intercourse and multiple sexual partners. Among men, multivariate logistic regression identified awareness of HIV negative partner status, multiple sexual partners and low levels of partner violence and among women Zulu or Swati ethnicity were associated with unprotected intercourse. HIV positive concordance was associated with protected sex and in multilevel analysis of couples HIV positive status and awareness of the partner's HIV positive status were associated with protected sex. High levels of HIV risk behaviour was found among couples during pregnancy calling for HIV risk reduction interventions.Original Abstract: La meta de este estudio fue describir la conducta sexual de riesgo de 239 parejas durante el embarazo, y examinar la relacion entre la conducta sexual de riesgo y VIH serostatus y la violencia domestica. Un tercio (31.8 %) de las mujeres embarazadas y 20.9 % de las parejas masculinas eran VIH positivo. Los factores de riesgo de VIH incluyeron falta de conocimiento de VIH serostatus de la pareja, relacion sexual sin proteccion y parejas sexuales multiples. Entre los hombres, regresion logistica multivariable identifico conciencia del estado de VIH negativo de la pareja, parejas sexuales multiples y niveles bajos de violencia domestica, y entre mujeres, la etnicidad Zulu o Swati fue asociada con relacion sexual sin proteccion. Concordancia de VIH positivo fue asociada con sexo con proteccion, y en analisis de multiniveles de parejas, el estado VIH positivo y la conciencia del estado VIH positivo de la pareja fueron asociados con sexo con proteccion. Altos niveles de conducta de riesgo de VIH fueron encontrados entre parejas durante el embarazo, pidiendo intervenciones para reducir el riesgo de VIH.

A Survey Experiment of Women's Attitudes About Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Rural Bangladesh

Author: Yount, Kathryn M1; Halim, Nafisa; Schuler, Sidney Ruth; Head, Sara1 Hubert Department of Global Health and Department of Sociology, Emory University, 1518 Clifton Rd. NE, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA kyount@emory.edu

Abstract: According to the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in poorer countries, 50 % of women of reproductive age report that wife hitting or beating is justified. Such high rates may result from structural pressures to adopt such views or to report the perceived socially desirable response. In a survey experiment of 496 ever-married women aged 18-49 years in rural Bangladesh, we compared responses to attitudinal questions that (1) replicated the 2007 Bangladesh DHS wording and portrayed the wife as transgressive for unstated reasons with elaborations depicting her as (2) unintentionally and (3) willfully transgressive. The probabilities of justifying wife hitting or beating were consistently low for unintended transgressions (.01-.08). Willful transgressions yielded higher probabilities (.40-.70), which resembled those based on the DHS wording (.38-.57). Cognitive interviews illustrated that village women held diverse views, which were attributed to social change. Also, ambiguity in the DHS questions may have led some women to interpret them according to perceived gender norms and to give the socially desirable response of justified. Results inform modifications to these DHS questions and identify women for ideational-change interventions. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence in Interracial and Monoracial Couples

Author: Martin, Brittny A1; Cui, Ming; Ueno, Koji; Fincham, Frank D1 The Florida State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1567044847?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study, using a nationally representative sample, investigated intimate partner violence (IPV) in interracial and monoracial relationships. Regression analyses indicated that interracial couples demonstrated a higher level of mutual IPV than monoracial White couples but a level similar to monoracial Black couples. There were significant gender differences in IPV, with women reporting lower levels of victimization than men. Regarding relationship status, cohabiting couples demonstrated the highest levels of IPV, and dating couples reported the lowest levels. Regarding interactions among couple racial composition, relationship status, and respondents' gender, an interaction between racial composition and relationship status was found. Implications for practitioners and directions for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The aim of the article is to explore the nature of domestic violence and responses to it among a cross-section of women who sought help at a Family Counselling Centre in Bengaluru. They were interviewed with the help of an in-depth interview guide for qualitative data. The women interviewees described their experiences, their reasons for staying on in abusive relationships, suffering violence at the hands of husbands and other family members, their future plans and the alternatives open to them. Interventions by agencies meant to help them have a vital role to play and must offer a wide range of services. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

Child Abuse as a Catalyst for Wife Abuse

Author: Emery, Clifton R1; Kim, Jaeyop; Song, Hyun-a; Song, AhYoung1 School of Social Work, Yonsei University, Appenzeller 214 Shinchon-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, South Korea cemery@yonsei.ac.kr

Abstract: This paper draws on Matza's (1964/1990) theory of deviance to propose that the father's current abuse of the child moderates the relationship between father's patriarchal beliefs and current perpetration of husband violence in South Korea. Drawing on Matza's concept of neutralizing beliefs, the paper argues that child abuse potentiates patriarchal beliefs, allowing husbands to extend rationalizations for child abuse to rationalizations for wife abuse, resulting in an interaction effect. The paper tests this hypothesized interaction effect using data from a nationally representative sample of 585 South Korean men. The paper then tests a competing alternative hypothesis that any type of violence (including violence outside the family) by the father acts as a moderator. Support is found for the child abuse as moderator hypothesis but not for the competing hypothesis. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Among Hispanics: A Review of the Literature

Author: Cummings, Amanda M1; Gonzalez-Guarda, Rosa M; Sandoval, Melanie F1 School of Nursing and Health Studies, University of Miami, Miami, USA amandamcummings@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429629194?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper analyzed the existing literature on risk and protective factors for intimate partner violence among Hispanics using the four-level social-ecological model of prevention. Three popular search engines, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Google Scholar, were reviewed for original research articles published since the year 2000 that specifically examined factors associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) among Hispanics. Factors related to perpetration and victimization for both males and females were reviewed. Conflicting findings related to IPV risk and protective factors were noted; however, there were some key factors consistently shown to be related to violence in intimate relationships that can be targeted through prevention efforts. Future implications for ecologically-informed research, practice, and policy are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Male Victims of Domestic Violence

Author: Drijber, Babette C1; Reijnders, Udo JL; Ceelen, Manon1 Department of Forensic Medicine, Municipal Public Health Service, pobox 2200, 1000 CE, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, bcbabs@hotmail.com

Abstract: Most studies regarding DV focused mainly on female victims. To gain more insight into the problems male victims encounter, this study investigated the characteristics of this group in the Netherlands. Adult male victims of DV filled out an online questionnaire regarding the characteristics of the abuse (N=372). When men are victims of DV, they are physically as well as psychologically abused with the female (ex)-partners often being their perpetrator. The most important reason for men not to report the abuse is the belief the police would not take any action. Our findings suggest society should be aware that men are also victims of DV and feel the need to talk about it and desire support.

Abstract: Increasing evidence indicates that children are at risk of homicide in the context of domestic violence. Using a retrospective case analysis of 84 domestic homicide cases, this study sought to identify the unique factors that place a child at risk of homicide. Three groups of domestic homicide cases in which there were no children in the home (No Child in the Home, n=44), a child was targeted (Child Target, n=13), and a child was present, but not targeted (No Child Target, n=27) were compared. Overall, there were no significant differences amongst cases involving children (targeted or not) on major factors except for the higher number of agencies involved with couples with children. Few cases had risk assessment or safety plans completed. Despite the study limitations, the findings speak to the need for professionals to assess child risk and include children in safety planning in all cases of domestic violence.

Abstract: Parenting characteristics can have a significant influence on how children are affected by family violence. The purpose of this study was to explore the role women's parenting stress plays in the relationship between exposure to physical and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) and children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Data for this study were taken from three waves of the Illinois Families Study. The final sample included 1,653 children from 805 families. Structural equation modeling analyses were conducted across two developmental stages in order to better understand the unique relationships based on child development. For children ages 6-12 years, parenting stress mediated the relationship between exposure to psychological IPV and internalizing behaviors. No direct or indirect pathways between exposure to IPV and children's behavior problems were found among adolescents ages 13-17. Implications for social service interventions with children and families exposed to violence are included.

Status Compatibility and Help-Seeking Behaviors Among Female Intimate Partner Violence Victims

Author: Kaukinen, Catherine Elizabeth1; Meyer, Silke; Akers, Caroline1 University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704691?accountid=14925

Abstract: Given the far-reaching social, personal, and economic costs of crime and violence, as well as the lasting health effects, understanding how women respond to domestic violence and the types of help sought are critical in addressing intimate partner violence. We use a nationally representative dataset (Canadian General Social Survey, Personal Risk, 1999) to examine the help-seeking behaviors of female intimate partner violence victims (N = 250). Although victims of violent crime often do not call the police, many victims, particularly women who have been battered by their partner rely on family, friends, social service, and mental health interventions in dealing with the consequences of violent crime. We examine the role of income, education, and employment status in shaping women's decisions to seek help, and we treat these economic variables as symbolic and relative statuses as compared to male partners. Although family violence researchers have conceptualized the association between economic variables and the dynamics of intimate partner violence with respect to the structural dimensions of sociodemographic factors, feminist researchers connect economic power to family dynamics. Drawing on these literatures, we tap the power in marital and cohabiting relationships, rather than treating these variables as simply socioeconomic resources. Controlling for other relevant variables we estimate a series of multivariate models to examine the relationship between status compatibilities and help-seeking from both formal and informal sources. We find that status incompatibilities between partners that favor women increase the likelihood of seeking support in dealing with the impact of violence.

We Are Not Joking: Need for Controls in Reports of Dating Violence

Author: Fernandez-Gonzalez, Liria1; O'Leary, K Daniel; Munoz-Rivas, Marina Julia1 Universidad Autononoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704813?accountid=14925

Abstract: Underreporting of intimate partner aggression is an important issue in the interpretation of self-reports of such aggression, especially by males. However, both males and females are less likely to report negative behaviors about themselves than about their partners. With 863 adolescents from Madrid, social desirability had a small but significant association with reports of dating aggression, but covariance corrections for social desirability did not alter the conclusions about such aggression. Using uncorrected or corrected means for social desirability, males engage in more sexual aggression against their partners and females engage in more psychological and physical aggression. Maximal dyadic reports based on reports by either self or partner significantly increased the rates of aggression, although conclusions about perpetration and victimization did not differ with this correction. Rates of aggression dropped roughly half when corrected for aggression in a joking context, but more females still reported engaging in physical aggression against their partners. The corrections one wishes to use depend upon the sample under study-i.e., adolescent versus adult populations-and one's research or clinical question, but the use of social desirability controls seems ill-founded. Finally, there is a need for in-depth interviews with both partners in dating relationships to determine more about the contextual factors associated with dating aggression and to assist in knowing what correction factors seem most valid.

A Preliminary Investigation of the Influence of Subjective Norms and Relationship Commitment on Stages of Change in Female Intimate Partner Violence Victims

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women is a prevalent and serious problem throughout the world, causing devastating mental and physical health problems for victims. Recent research has begun to focus on factors that may influence women's decisions to stay or leave their abusive partners, as interventions for batterers has only resulted in minimal success in reducing IPV. Therefore, this study preliminarily examined the influence of women's perceptions of their social network members' subjective norms and their relationship commitment on stages of change to end an abusive relationship among a community sample of female IPV victims (N = 84). Results showed that subjective norms and women's relationship commitment were associated with women's stages of change. Relationship commitment did not mediate the relation between subjective norms and stages of change. These findings indicate that a number of factors contribute to women's stay/leave decision-making process, and close social network members could be included in interventions designed to keep women safe.

A Longitudinal Examination of Offending and Specialization Among a Sample of Massachusetts Domestic Violence Offenders

Author: Richards, Tara N1; Jennings, Wesley G; Tomsich, Elizabeth A; Gover, Angela R1 Appalachian State University, Boone, NC, USA

Abstract: A paucity of existing research focuses on longitudinal examinations of criminal trajectories among reoffenses committed by domestic violence offenders. Specifically, few studies have longitudinally assessed whether domestic violence offenders specialize, recidivating in domestic violence assault, or generalize, committing a range of personal and property crimes. Acknowledging these research deficiencies, the current study uses longitudinal data from a cohort of 317 batterers who were processed in a domestic violence court to investigate the trajectories of domestic violence arrests and nondomestic violence arrests over a 10-year period. The degree of overlap between domestic and nondomestic violence arrest trajectory groups is examined through a cross-tabulation and chi-square analysis. Logistic and multinomial regression models are applied to identify risk factors that distinguish trajectory groups. A PROC TRAJ procedure identifies two trajectory groups for domestic violence arrests (low and high rate) and three trajectory groups for nondomestic violence arrests (very low, low, and high rate). Results indicate that specialization among domestic violence offenders is rare-prior alcohol and drug crimes predict membership in the high-rate domestic violence arrest trajectory group and prior domestic violence arrests predict membership in both the low-rate and high-rate nondomestic violence arrest trajectories. Implications for future research and policy are discussed in this article.

Sexual Orientation Disparities in Substance Misuse: The Role of Childhood Abuse and Intimate Partner Violence Among Patients in Care at an Urban Community Health Center

Author: Reisner, Sari L1; Falb, Kathryn L; Van Wagenen, Aimee; Grasso, Chris; Bradford, Judith1 The Fenway Institute, Fenway Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA sreisner@fenwayhealth.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364703638?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined disparities in lifetime substance misuse by sexual orientation among 2,653 patients engaged in care at an urban community health center in Boston, MA, as well as the potential mediating roles of childhood abuse <age 15 (CA) and intimate partner violence (IPV). Violence indicators were highly associated with substance misuse, as was identifying as a sexual minority compared to heterosexual. CA and IPV experiences partly explained disparities in substance abuse by sexual orientation with differences seen by sex. Clinicians should assess history of CA and IPV among sexual minorities presenting with a history of substance abuse disorders. The study's limitations are noted. Adapted from the source document.

PTSD Symptoms in Young Children Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Levendosky, Alytia A1; Bogat, GAnne; Martinez-Torteya, Cecilia1 Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1325475707?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) places infants and young children at risk for development of trauma symptoms. However, this is an understudied consequence of IPV because young children pose particular difficulties for assessment of trauma symptoms. The authors collected maternal reports on mothers' and children's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and IPV yearly, from ages 1 to 7. Approximately half of the children exposed to IPV at each time period developed some trauma symptoms, and frequency of IPV witnessed was associated with PTSD symptoms. Maternal and child PTSD symptoms were correlated, suggesting that young children may be particularly vulnerable to relational PTSD due to their close physical and emotional relationship with their parents.

Iraqi American Refugee Youths' Exposure to Violence: Relationship to Attitudes and Peers' Perpetration of Dating Violence

Abstract: This exploratory study examines the relationships between exposure to violence in the community, school, home and dating relationships among Iraqi American youth. As Iraqi American youth are traditionally not allowed to date, dating violence measures focused on attitudes about and perceptions of abuse occurring in the relationships of friends. The number of friends known who were secretly dating was the most significant predictor of acceptability of dating violence and perceived prevalence of abuse. Youth who experienced child abuse perceived higher rates of dating violence among their peers. Findings highlight the complexities of prevention and intervention of teen dating violence within secretive relationships. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Framing Deadly Domestic Violence: Why the Media's Spin Matters in Newspaper Coverage of Femicide

Author: Gillespie, Lane Kirkland1; Richards, Tara N; Givens, Eugena M; Smith, M Dwayne1 Boise State University, Boise, ID, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463020240?accountid=14925

Abstract: The news media play a substantial role in shaping society's perceptions of social issues, including domestic violence. However, minimal research has been conducted to examine whether news media frame stories of femicide within the context of domestic violence. Using frame analysis, the present research compares newspaper articles representing 113 cases of femicide that define the murder as domestic violence to a random sample of 113 cases without coverage defining the femicide as domestic violence. Findings indicate that both groups are represented by multiple frames, including a previously unidentified frame that places the femicide in the context of domestic violence as a social problem.

Men's Beliefs and Attitudes Toward Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Pakistan

Author: Zakar, Rubeena1; Zakar, Muhammad Zakria; Kraemer, Alexander1 University of the Punjab, New Campus, Lahore, Pakistan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1325475681?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article documents the beliefs and attitudes of men toward intimate partner violence in Pakistan. Men's beliefs and attitudes toward partner violence are shaped by the life-long process of gender socialization, where the role of wife is projected as submissive and docile. Drawing on eight in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted in Lahore and Sialkot, this article presents how men perceive and justify partner violence within the context of Pakistani society. The data show that the construct of "ideal wife" inculcated among men fits into Foucault's notion of "docile bodies," which are subjected to control, discipline, and violent punishment.

Forced Sexual Initiation, Sexual Intimate Partner Violence and HIV Risk in Women: A Global Review of the Literature

Author: Stockman, Jamila K1; Lucea, Marguerite B; Campbell, Jacquelyn C1 Division of Global Public Health, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, MC 0849, La Jolla, CA, 92093-0849, USA jstockman@ucsd.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667948169?accountid=14925

Abstract: Coerced or forced sexual initiation and sexual intimate partner violence (sexual IPV) contribute significantly to a woman's risk for HIV infection. This review systematically examines global research (n = 21 studies) published since 2000 on the role of coerced/forced sexual initiation and sexual IPV on HIV risk in women. In predominantly low- and middle-income countries, coerced/forced sexual initiation was associated with HIV/STIs, multiple and high-risk sex partners, and no condom use. Most studies using behaviorally specific terms for sexual IPV found strong associations between sexual IPV and HIV risk behaviors. In contrast, studies using less specific definitions often failed to find these significant associations. To develop more comprehensive HIV prevention programs, future efforts should integrate behaviorally specific terms into assessing prevalence of sexual IPV and its association with HIV risk, consider cultural differences, and identify causal pathways between coerced or forced sexual initiation, HIV risk behaviors and HIV/STI infection.

Family Law Proceedings, Domestic Violence and the Impact upon School: A Neglected Area of Research

Author: Eriksson, Maria1; Bruno, Linnea; Nasman, Elisabet1 Department of Sociology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322720041?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this article is to open up a discussion about an unexplored area of children's lives at school. While there has been considerable discussion of issues about child protection and the cooperation between school and social services in that context, studies on the intersection between school and family law proceedings seem virtually non-existent. This is also the case when it comes to family law proceedings and different forms of childhood adversity. Drawing upon previous and ongoing research on family law and domestic violence in Sweden, together with a number of other existing studies on children and domestic violence, this article outlines the potential impact of family law proceedings upon school as well as issues requiring further research exploration. Adapted from the source document.

When Home Is No Longer "Sweet": Family Violence and Sharia Court-Annexed Mediation in Indonesia

Author: Syukur, Fatahillah Abdul; Bagshaw, Dale Margaret

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364703334?accountid=14925

Abstract: Sharia court-annexed mediation was first implemented in the Indonesian judiciary system in 2008. The majority of mediators in Sharia courts are male judges who are obligated by civil procedure law to initially settle disputes amicably prior to the litigation process. The authors argue that court-annexed mediation has the potential to be the champion of Indonesian legal reform as it has similar characteristics to musyawarah, the indigenous way of resolving conflicts. However, given the prevalence of violence against women in disputes arising from separation and divorce, mediators must have appropriate awareness, knowledge, skills, and techniques to identify, understand, and handle these cases. .

The sociological significance of domestic violence: Tensions, paradoxes and implications

Author: Hearn, Jeff11 Hanken School of Economics, Finland; Linkoping University, Sweden; University of Huddersfield, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364702351?accountid=14925

Abstract: Sociology and sociological theory has been effective in analyzing societal and institutional conflict and violence, but less so the specifics of interpersonal violence. This article examines the sociological significance of domestic violence. This relationship, or sometimes its neglect, is underlain by several tensions and paradoxes, which in turn have broader implications for sociology and sociological theory. These matters are examined through: the possible paradox of violence and intimacy in the phenomenon of domestic violence; the importance of the naming and framing of such violence; explanation, responsibility and agency; and gender, hegemony and discourse in men's violence to known women, as part of a multifaceted power approach.

Early Marriage, Marital Relations and Intimate Partner Violence in Ethiopia

Author: Erulkar, Annabel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299288?accountid=14925

Abstract: A considerable proportion of women worldwide are married during childhood. Although many studies have examined early marriage (before age 18), few have compared outcomes or correlates among girls married during different stages of adolescence or have focused on girls married very early (before age 15). Data from a population-based survey conducted in 2009-2010 in seven Ethiopian regions were used to examine early marriage among 1,671 women aged 20-24. Seventeen percent of respondents had married before age 15 and 30% had married at ages 15-17. Most of those who married before age 18 had never been to school. Compared with young women who had married at ages 18-19, those married before age 15 were less likely to have known about the marriage beforehand (odds ratio, 0.2) and more likely to have experienced forced first marital sex (3.8). Educational attainment was positively associated with foreknowledge and wantedness of marriage and with high levels of marital discussions about fertility and reproductive health issues. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This study manipulated the race of the defendant and the victim (White/White, White/Asian, Asian/Asian, and Asian/White) in a domestic violence case to examine the potential prejudicial impact of race on juror decision making. A total of 181undergraduate students read a trial transcript involving an allegation of spousal abuse in which defendant and victim race were manipulated using photographs. They then provided a verdict and confidence rating, a sentence, and responsibility attributions, and completed various scales measuring attitudes toward wife abuse and women. Findings revealed that female jurors were harsher toward the defendant than were male jurors. When controlling for attitudes toward Asians, jurors found the defendant guilty more often in cases involving interracial couples, as compared to same-race couples. Path analyses revealed various factors and attitudes involved in domestic violence trial outcomes. Findings contribute to the scarce literature on legal proceedings involving Asians, particularly in domestic violence cases. Outcomes also provide a model for relevant factors and characteristics of jurors in domestic violence cases. Roadblocks inherent in jury research are also discussed.

Rural Australian Women's Legal Help Seeking for Intimate Partner Violence: Women Intimate Partner Violence Victim Survivors' Perceptions of Criminal Justice Support Services

Author: Ragusa, Angela T11 Charles Sturt University, Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438557469?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a widespread, ongoing, and complex global social problem, whose victims continue to be largely women. Women often prefer to rely on friends and family for IPV help, yet when informal support is unavailable they remain hesitant to contact formal services, particularly legal support for many reasons. This study applies a sociological lens by framing the IPV and legal help-seeking experiences of rural Australian women gained from 36 in-depth face-to-face interviews as socially contextualized interactions. Findings reveal police and court responses reflect broader social inequalities and rurality exacerbates concerns such as anonymity and lack of service. Cultural differences and power imbalances between survivors and formal support providers are manifested to inform future research seeking to improve survivors' willingness to engage and satisfaction with formal services. Finally, the important role police and the criminal justice system play in de-stigmatizing IPV and legitimating its unacceptability is argued a crucial, yet unrecognized, key to social change.

Fathers' Emotional Awareness and Children's Empathy and Externalizing Problems: The Role of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Maliken, Ashley C1; Fainsilber Katz, Lynn1 University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438555324?accountid=14925

Abstract: Emerging evidence suggests that fathers, more so than mothers, socialize emotions in a gender-stereotyped manner. Gender-stereotyped emotion socialization may be particularly pronounced in men perpetrating intimate partner violence (IPV), and may be detrimental to child adjustment, particularly for boys. This study explored the relation between fathers' socialization of children's emotions and child adjustment in families where IPV is present. We hypothesized that in families where there is IPV, fathers' awareness of their children's sadness and fear will be associated with negative child outcomes. Participants were 74 families recruited for a longitudinal study. Interview and questionnaire measures were used to assess IPV and fathers' emotional awareness when children were 5 years old. Child adjustment was measured when children were 16 years old. Results suggested that in families where there is IPV, fathers who were more aware of their children's fear had children who showed lower levels of empathy and higher levels of externalizing problems than children whose fathers were less aware of their fear, specifically for boys. Results are discussed in terms of gender socialization in families where there is IPV. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Domestic Violence in India: Insights From the 2005-2006 National Family Health Survey

Author: Kimuna, Sitawa R1; Djamba, Yanyi K; Ciciurkaite, Gabriele; Cherukuri, Suvarna1 East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1320861311?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article assesses the prevalence and risk factors of domestic violence in India. The study uses the 2005-2006 India National Family Health Survey-III (NFHS-III) and focuses on the 69,484 ever-married women ages 15 to 49 from all regions, who were administered the domestic violence module. The results show that 31% of respondents experienced physical violence in the past 12 months before the survey; the corresponding figure for sexual violence was 8.3%. The multivariate logistic regression results show key determinants of physical and sexual violence. Some of the most salient findings are that urban residence, household wealth, affiliation with Christian religious denominations, wife's age at marriage and education are associated with lower risk of physical and sexual violence. In contrast, being employed and being the wife of a man who drank alcohol increased the odds of experiencing both physical and sexual violence. Moreover, respondents who believed that wife-beating was justified under certain circumstances were more likely to experience domestic violence. These results and significant regional differences observed in this study suggest that gender role conditioning and cultural norms both contribute to domestic violence. Interventions, therefore, need to go beyond the institutional and legal levels to include cultural capital, which addresses partner and relationship issues.

Intimate Partner Violence and Welfare Participation: A Longitudinal Causal Analysis

Author: Cheng, Tyrone C11 University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438555679?accountid=14925

Abstract: This longitudinal study examined the temporal-ordered causal relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV), five mental disorders (depression, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic attack, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), alcohol abuse/dependence, drug abuse/dependence, treatment seeking (from physician, counselor, and self-help group), employment, child support, and welfare participation. It was a secondary data analysis of records of 571 women; the records were extracted from the study "Violence Against Women and the Role of Welfare Reform" (VAWRWR). Results from generalized estimating equations (GEE) showed that experiencing controlling behaviors reduced likelihood of welfare participation whereas experiencing physical abuse increased it. Significant impact on welfare participation was wielded by panic attack, drug abuse/dependence, and employment; treatment seeking and child support made no significant impact. The study found no significant mediating effect wielded by panic attack, drug abuse/dependence, employment, or child support on welfare participation's relationship to controlling behaviors or physically abusive behaviors experienced. Implications for intervention are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Prevalence and Risk Factors for Domestic Violence Among Pregnant Women in Northern Nigeria

Author: Iliyasu, Zubairu1; Abubakar, Isa S; Galadanci, Hadiza S; Hayatu, Zainab; Aliyu, Muktar H1 Department of Community Medicine, Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554972?accountid=14925

Abstract: Many women experience domestic violence during pregnancy. The magnitude and risk factors for domestic violence during pregnancy are not well documented in many countries, including Nigeria. Using interviewer-administered questionnaires the authors investigated predictors of domestic violence during current pregnancy among women presenting for antenatal care at a tertiary care facility in northern Nigeria (n = 400). A total of 29 of 392 respondents (7.4%) experienced domestic violence during the current pregnancy. Of those who experienced violence, the majority (58.6%) reported being physically assaulted. Sexual violence was reported by only 4 respondents (13.8%). Financial and domestic issues were the major triggers of domestic violence. After adjusting for potential confounders, it was found that victims' educational attainment and occupation remained significant predictors of domestic violence. Higher educational attainment of women and their engagement in economic activity outside the home were associated with a decreased risk for domestic violence. There is a need for preventive, protective, and redress mechanisms to guard against domestic violence in Nigeria. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

The Association of Readiness to Change and Motivational Interviewing with Treatment Outcomes in Males involved in Domestic Violence Group Therapy

Author: Zalmanowitz, Sharla J1; Babins-Wagner, Robbie; Rodger, Susan; Corbett, Bradley A; Leschied, Alan1 Faculty of Education, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1318342652?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study investigated the impact of motivational interviewing (MI) and stage of change on a self-report measure of global functioning (Outcome Questionnaire [OQ 45.2]). Participants were men mandated to attend the Responsible Choices for Men (RCM) group therapy program following an incident of domestic violence. The study design utilized a quasi-experimental between-groups comparison utilizing data collected at three time points (pregroup, first group session, and final group session). One group of mandated program attendees received two sessions of MI (n = 106), whereas the comparison group did not (n = 106). Stage of change was assessed using the URICA-G and the URICA-DV (University of Rhode Island Change Assessment-Domestic Violence). Multilevel growth modeling indicated that stage of change has a significant relationship to global functioning. Discussion focuses on the potential benefits of MI as a pregroup treatment and the importance of accounting for individual readiness to change.

Physical Domestic Violence and Subsequent Contraceptive Adoption Among Women in Rural India

Author: Stephenson, Rob1; Jadhav, Apoorva; Hindin, Michelle1 Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1318228862?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between male to female physical domestic violence and contraceptive adoption among women in four economically and culturally distinct areas of India. Data from India's 1998-1999 National Family Health Survey-2 and a follow-up survey in 2002-2003 for which the same women in four states were reinterviewed are analyzed. The focus of the analysis is on how baseline exposure to physical domestic violence is associated with the intersurvey adoption of contraception. Women who experience physical violence from their husbands are significantly less likely to adopt contraception in the intersurvey period, although this relationship varies by State. This study builds upon previous work by using an indicator of physical domestic violence exposure that is measured before contraceptive adoption, thus allowing the identification of how exposure to violence shapes the adoption of contraception. The results demonstrate that for women living in Bihar and Jharkhand there is a clear negative relationship between physical domestic violence and a woman's adoption of contraception; this relationship was not found for women in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The results point to the need to include domestic violence screening and referral services into family planning services.

Directors' Opinions About Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Service Strategies That Help Survivors

Author: Macy, Rebecca J1; Rizo, Cynthia F; Johns, Natalie B; Ermentrout, Dania M1 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA

Abstract: Little evidence is available regarding recommended practices for domestic violence and sexual assault services. Although there is a literature concerned with these services, few studies have investigated recommended practices from the perspective of community providers. In addition, researchers have not yet investigated the utility of specific domestic violence and sexual assault service delivery strategies. To help address these knowledge needs, the authors investigated agency directors' perspectives on six types of services typically offered by domestic violence and sexual assault agencies including crisis, legal advocacy, medical advocacy, support group, individual counseling, and shelter. The authors also examined the extent to which directors' opinions about service delivery practices differed based on key agency's characteristics, specifically the services offered (i.e., domestic violence, sexual assault, or both) and agency location (i.e., rural, suburban, or urban). A sample of 97 (94% response rate) North Carolina agency directors completed a survey on recommended service delivery practices. The authors conducted descriptive analyses to identify directors' overall opinions about service delivery practices and used multivariate analysis of variance to examine whether directors' opinions about service delivery practices differed according to agency characteristics. Findings showed differences in directors' opinions about service delivery practices based on their agency's service location. Practice recommendations were garnered from the study's results.

Factors Mediating the Relationship Between Intimate Partner Violence and Chronic Pain in Chinese Women

Author: Tiwari, Agnes1; Fong, Daniel YT; Chan, Chee-Hon; Ho, Pak-Chung1 School of Nursing, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong

Abstract: There is increasing recognition that chronic pain is a problem affecting women survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV), and in Western literature evidence is emerging about significant factors mediating the relationship between IPV and chronic pain. However, little is known about the factors mediating IPV and chronic pain in Chinese women for whom prior research has shown that Chinese culture may influence their response to IPV. This study was conducted to assess the roles of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depressive symptoms, and IPV-related injury on the relationship between IPV and chronic pain in Chinese women, using structural equation modelling (SEM). Data were collected from 308 Chinese women survivors of IPV recruited at community setting (n = 228) and at domestic violence shelters (n = 82). Results showed that only the relationship between psychological abuse severity and chronic pain severity was mediated by PTSD symptom severity ( beta = .30, 95% CI = 0.14-0.45, p < .001). Furthermore, although depressive symptom severity was strongly correlated with PTSD symptom severity ( beta = .69, 95% CI = 0.61-0.76, p < .001), it was not found to be mediating the relationship between any types of IPV and chronic pain. Similarly, IPV-related injury severity was not shown to have a significant mediating effect on the relationship between IPV and chronic pain. The findings affirm the importance of recognizing the complex interrelationships among IPV, mental health symptoms, and physical health problems as well as the need for considering PTSD symptoms when designing interventions for abused Chinese women with complaints of chronic pain.

Sexual Orientation Disparities in History of Intimate Partner Violence: Results From the California Health Interview Survey

Author: Goldberg, Naomi G1; Meyer, Ilan H1 The Williams Institute, CA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1318230350?accountid=14925

Abstract: Few studies have examined history of intimate partner violence (IPV) among sexual minorities. We assessed prevalence and predictors of IPV using a probability sample of California residents ages 18 to 70. Lifetime and 1-year IPV prevalence was higher in sexual minorities compared with heterosexuals but this was significant only for bisexual women and gay men. IPV of bisexual women, but not gay men, occurred in a heterosexual relationship. We tested whether the higher prevalence of IPV in gay men and bisexual women was explained by two mental health indicators-psychological distress and binge drinking-but this hypothesis was not supported.

Implicit Theories of Relationships and Close Relationship Violence: Does Believing Your Relationship Can Grow Relate to Lower Perpetration of Violence

Author: Cobb, Rebecca A1; DeWall, C Nathan; Lambert, Nathaniel M; Fincham, Frank D1 Florida State University, Tallahassee, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705229?accountid=14925

Abstract: People differ in what they think makes for a successful relationship, but it is unclear how these beliefs relate to the perpetration of violence. Four studies (N = 2,591) examined the relationship between growth beliefs and the perpetration of violence in close relationships. Specifically, the current work tested the hypothesis that growth beliefs mitigate against close relationship violence, possibly due to increased satisfaction with sacrificing one's own self-interest for the betterment of the relationship. Studies 1 and 2 provided cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence that growth beliefs predicted less perpetration of close relationship violence. Studies 3 and 4 showed that the relationship between growth beliefs and lower perpetration of violence was mediated by satisfaction with sacrifice within one's relationship. All effects of growth beliefs remained significant after controlling for destiny beliefs. Discussion centers on the importance of implicit theories of relationships for understanding the perpetration of violence in close relationships.

Mixed-Gender Co-Facilitation in Therapeutic Groups for Men Who Have Perpetrated Intimate Partner Violence: Group Members' Perspectives

Author: Roy, Valerie1; Lindsay, Jocelyn; Dallaire, Louis-Francois1 Universite Laval valerie.roy@svs.ulaval.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463019253?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes a study that explored the use of mixed-gender co-facilitation in intimate partner violence groups, especially regarding its potential for gender role socialization. Using an interpretive approach, interviews with men from different mixed-gender co-facilitated groups in Canada were analyzed, with a focus on the men's perceptions of the co-facilitators' attitudes and behaviors in promoting therapeutic interactions. Analysis revealed these interactions were beneficial with respect to the men's problem with violence, group leader support, and group dynamics, and that the difficulties with the group process are not insurmountable. Implications for research and practice are explored and limitations are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Attitudes of Palestinian Physicians Toward Wife Abuse: Their Definitions, Perceptions of Causes, and Perceptions of Appropriate Interventions

Author: Haj-Yahia, Muhammad M11 Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463026553?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article presents results from a larger survey, which examined the attitudes and perceptions of Palestinian physicians (N = 396) toward wife abuse. The instrument was a self-administered questionnaire, with open-ended questions in which participants expressed their definitions of wife abuse, their perceptions of the causes of wife abuse, and their perceptions of appropriate interventions with wife abuse. The relevance of the sociocultural contexts of Palestinian society in particular and Arab societies in general to the participants' responses is highlighted in the article. The limitations of the study as well as implications for theory development, future research, and professional training are discussed.

Domestic Violence Against Single, Never-Married Women in the Occupied Palestinian Territory

Author: Assaf, Shireen1; Chaban, Stephanie1 University of Padova, Padova, Italy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463012842?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the association between decision-making power, with other background variables, and domestic violence against single, never-married women in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). Secondary analysis using data from a 2006 Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics domestic violence survey revealed that decision-making power and age were significant predictors of physical and psychological abuse. Relation to household head, refugee status, education, employment, and locality were not significant; region was only significant for psychological abuse. Further studies are needed to understand what factors allow single, never-married women to exercise decision-making power in the household and its association with domestic violence.

Intimate partner violence and HIV risk factors among African-American and African-Caribbean women in clinic-based settings

Author: Stockman, Jamila K1; Lucea, Marguerite B; Draughon, Jessica E; Sabri, Bushra; Anderson, Jocelyn C; Bertrand, Desiree; Campbell, Doris W; Callwood, Gloria B; Campbell, Jacquelyn C1 Division of Global Public Health, Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA jstockman@ucsd.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429624863?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite progress against intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV/AIDS in the past two decades, both epidemics remain major public health problems, particularly among women of color. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between recent IPV and HIV risk factors (sexual and drug risk behaviors, sexually transmitted infections [STIs], condom use, and negotiation) among women of African descent. We conducted a comparative case-control study in women's health clinics in Baltimore, MD, USA and St. Thomas and St. Croix, US Virgin Islands (USVI). Women aged 18-55 years who experienced physical and/or sexual IPV in the past two years (Baltimore, n=107; USVI, n=235) were compared to women who never experienced any form of abuse (Baltimore, n=207; USVI, n=119). Logistic regression identified correlates of recent IPV by site. In both sites, having a partner with concurrent sex partners was independently associated with a history of recent IPV (Baltimore, AOR: 3.91, 95% CI: 1.79-8.55 and USVI, AOR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.11-4.56). In Baltimore, factors independently associated with recent IPV were lifetime casual sex partners (AOR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.11-3.57), exchange sex partners (AOR: 5.26, 95% CI: 1.92-14.42), infrequent condom use during vaginal sex (AOR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.08-0.72), and infrequent condom use during anal sex (AOR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09-0.93). In contrast, in the USVI, having a concurrent sex partner (AOR: 3.33, 95% CI: 1.46-7.60), frequent condom use during vaginal sex (AOR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.06-3.65), frequent condom use during anal sex (AOR: 6.29, 95% CI: 1.57-25.23), drug use (AOR: 3.16, 95% CI: 1.00-10.06), and a past-year STI (AOR: 2.68, 95% CI: 1.25-5.72) were associated with recent IPV history. The divergent results by site warrant further investigation into the potential influence of culture, norms, and intentions on the relationships examined. Nonetheless, study findings support a critical need to continue the development and implementation of culturally tailored screening for IPV within HIV prevention and treatment programs.

Increasing Rejection of Intimate Partner Violence: Evidence of Global Cultural Diffusion

Author: Pierotti, Rachael S11 Population Studies Center, University of Michigan, 426 Thompson Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48106-1248 rpierot@umich.edu

Abstract: This study extends existing world society research on ideational diffusion by going beyond examinations of national policy change to investigate the spread of ideas among nonelite individuals. Specifically, I test whether recent trends in women's attitudes about intimate partner violence are converging toward global cultural scripts. Results suggest that global norms regarding violence against women are reaching citizens worldwide, including in some of the least privileged parts of the globe. During the first decade of the 2000s, women in 23 of the 26 countries studied became more likely to reject intimate partner violence. Structural socioeconomic or demographic changes, such as urbanization, rising educational attainment, increasing media access, and cohort replacement, fail to explain the majority of the observed trend. Rather, women of all ages and social locations became less likely to accept justifications for intimate partner violence. The near uniformity of the trend and speed of the change in attitudes about intimate partner violence suggest that global cultural diffusion has played an important role.

Testing the Link Between Child Maltreatment and Family Violence Among Police Officers

Author: Zavala, Egbert11 Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448996467?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to document the relationship between physical abuse during childhood and family violence among a group of police officers from the Baltimore Police Department in the United States. Analyzing data from the Police and Domestic Violence in Police Families in Baltimore, Maryland, 1997-1999, this study found a positive relationship between physical abuse and family violence toward spouses and children. Specifically, this study found that police officers who indicated that their parents where physical with them were more likely to report being physical with their spouse and children. They were also more likely to report yelling or shouting toward family members. This study shows a positive relationship between physical abuse and involvement in family violence, and increases our knowledge regarding the cycle of violence in police families. This study points to the need for better recognition of physical abuse and the negative consequences children are likely to endure.

Social context and drivers of intimate partner violence in rural Kenya: implications for the health of pregnant women

Author: Hatcher, Abigail M1; Romito, Patrizia; Odero, Merab; Bukusi, Elizabeth A; Onono, Maricianah; Turan, Janet M1 School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, USA hatchera@globalhealth.ucsf.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429641702?accountid=14925

Abstract: More than half of rural Kenyan women experience intimate partner violence (IPV) in their lifetime. Beyond physical consequences, IPV indirectly worsens maternal health because pregnant women avoid antenatal care or HIV testing when they fear violent reprisal from partners. To develop an intervention to mitigate violence towards pregnant women, we conducted qualitative research in rural Kenya. Through eight focus group discussions, four with pregnant women and four with male partners, and in-depth interviews with service providers, we explored the social context of IPV using an ecological model. We found that women experienced physical and sexual IPV, but also economic violence such as forced exile from the marital home or losing material support. Relationship triggers of IPV included perceived sexual infidelity or transgressing gender norms. Women described hiding antenatal HIV testing from partners, as testing was perceived as a sign of infidelity. Extended families were sometimes supportive, but often encouraged silence to protect the family image. The broader community viewed IPV as an intractable, common issue, which seemed to normalise its use. These results resonate with global IPV research showing that factors beyond the individual -- gender roles in intimate partnerships, family dynamics and community norms -- shape high rates of violence. Adapted from the source document.

In the Name of Harmony: The Erasure of Domestic Violence in China's Judicial Mediation

Author: He, Xin1; Hang Ng, Kwai1 School of Law, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong lwxin@cityu.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1373428450?accountid=14925

Abstract: Based on observations of court trials and extensive interviews with judges, this article explores how judicial mediation in China undermines the rights of the battered women in divorce cases. We find that even if the judges are able to establish that domestic violence is committed, it is often erased in the stage of judicial mediation. This is because judicial mediation inevitably focuses on settlement arrangements. Lingering reference to domestic abuse would simply invite new denials or refutations from the abuser. It thus risks ruining the mediation efforts made by the judge. Our findings raise important questions with regard to the compulsory practice of mediation in family cases in China. It also sheds light on the hidden problems created by judicial mediation or conciliation in general. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and HIV Risks among Female Sex Workers of Mumbai, India

Author: Karandikar, Sharvari1; Gezinski, Lindsay B1 The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554442?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research explored intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV risks among female sex workers of Mumbai, India. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 sex workers to explore their experiences of IPV in the context of commercial sex work. Severe forms of physical, sexual, and emotional violence were reported by sex workers. Outcomes of IPV were inability to negotiate safe sex, substance abuse, and negative perceptions of men. This article also discusses sex workers' responses and methods of resisting IPV. With increasing HIV infections among sex workers in Mumbai, this study draws attention to the need for field-based, gender-sensitive HIV prevention efforts that incorporate violence prevention. Adapted from the source document.

"Strength at Home" Group Intervention for Military Populations Engaging in Intimate Partner Violence: Pilot Findings

Author: Taft, Casey T1; Macdonald, Alexandra; Monson, Candice M; Walling, Sherry M; Resick, Patricia A; Murphy, Christopher M1 Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System (116B-4), 150 South Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA, 02130, USA casey.taft@va.gov

Abstract: In this brief report, we present information on the Strength at Home intervention to treat male active duty or military veteran perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV) as well as preliminary pilot study findings. Strength at Home is a 12-session cognitive-behavioral group intervention developed by the authors that is based on a social information processing model of IPV perpetration. Six men referred to two intervention groups and five collateral female partners participated in this pilot study. Findings indicated large reductions for most indices of physical and psychological IPV from pre-treatment to 6-month follow-up. These initial results are promising though the small sample size and other study limitations preclude our ability to draw firm conclusions. Adapted from the source document.

BIS/BAS Variables as Moderators of the Rumination-Intimate Partner Violence Link

Author: Sotelo, Joan Marianne1; Babcock, Julia C1 Department of Psychology, University of Houston, 126 Heyne Building, Houston, TX, 77204-5022, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429626724?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although cognitive rumination is related to violence perpetration, not all people who ruminate become violent. Four personality variables-impulsivity, anxiety, anger-in, anger-out-were tested as possible moderators of the link between the tendency to ruminate and the frequency of intimate partner violence (IPV). Variables related to the Behavioral Activation System (anger-out and impulsivity) were predicted to strengthen the rumination-IPV link; whereas measures related to the Behavioral Inhibition System (anger-in and anxiety) would suppress this link. As predicted, anger-out, anger-in, and impulsivity moderated the relation between rumination and IPV. No evidence was found for suppressor variables. Thus, appetitive drives appear to amplify the effect of rumination on violence. Clinically, therapeutic techniques that address rumination, anger, and impulsivity may help to reduce IPV risk.

Serendipitous Intervention: Qualitative Findings from the Study of Dynamic Patterns of Husband-to-Wife Abuse

Author: Becho, Johanna1; Burge, Sandra K; Katerndahl, David A; Ferrer, Robert L; Wood, Robert C1 Department of Family & Community Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, 7703 Floyd Curl Drive MSC 7795, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA, becho@uthscsa.edu

Abstract: This mixed methods study observed day-to-day dynamics of husband-to-wife abuse. Daily reporting and weekly interaction with a research associate appeared to offer great benefit. A sample of 20 women age 20-62, were enrolled. Participants at high risk for abuse were excluded. Women who met the inclusion criteria completed a baseline questionnaire. Participants were instructed to complete a daily telephone assessment for 60 days to track the prior day's abuse severity and potential violence predictors. Participants also completed a qualitative end-of-study interview. Women reported an increased awareness of community resources, heightened self-esteem and coping empowerment. Seven women (35 %) left their abusive relationships. Women who left were more educated but had lower socio-economic status (SES). Participants in common-law marriages were also more likely to leave. The unforeseen consequences of daily reporting coupled with regular contact with an engaged listener were positively associated with a woman's readiness for change.

Experiences of Domestic Violence as a Child and Career Choice

Author: Triplett, Ruth1; Higgins, George; Payne, Brian K1 Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, 23529, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429624494?accountid=14925

Abstract: Moving past descriptions of the amount and nature of domestic violence, researchers in the area of childhood violence now explore a variety of outcomes of experiences of domestic violence as a child. This includes the effects on various outcomes in adulthood though little research so far has explored career choice. In the current study, we examine whether experiencing domestic violence as a child increases the chance that an individual will choose a human services profession as a career and if individuals in the human services professions who report experiences of domestic violence as a child have lower rates of being a victim of domestic violence as adults than those who do not. The findings suggest that experiences of violence as a child do not significantly affect the choice of human services as a career. Those who choose human services as a career, however, are less likely to experience domestic violence as an adult. Adapted from the source document.

Navigating Between Control and Autonomy: Recently Arrived Iraqi Refugees' Perceptions Regarding Honor, Well-Being, and Risk for Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Fernbrant, Cecilia1; Essen, Birgitta; Ostergren, Per-Olof; Cantor-Graae, Elizabeth1 Division of Social Medicine and Global Health, Department of Clinical Sciences in Malmo, Lund University cecilia.fernbrant@med.lu.se

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429624246?accountid=14925

Abstract: Iraqi refugees face considerable challenges when migrating to countries where individual freedom has greater priority than the group-oriented honor culture. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with Iraqi male and female refugees residing in Sweden regarding honor, current well-being, and experiences of intimate partner violence. Feelings of psychological distress and worry about the future were frequently expressed. Men feared loss of status and unemployment, whereas women had more positive expectations regarding increased autonomy. Upholding honor norms and power shifts within the relationship could potentially lead to family conflicts and/or violence, with increased risk for adverse mental and somatic health consequences. Adapted from the source document.

Weapon Use Increases the Severity of Domestic Violence but Neither Weapon Use nor Firearm Access Increases the Risk or Severity of Recidivism

Author: Folkes, Stephanie E F1; Hilton, N Zoe; Harris, Grant T1 University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438557428?accountid=14925

Abstract: Use of weapons is a risk factor for domestic violence severity, especially lethality. It is not clear, however, whether access to firearms itself increases assault severity, or whether it is characteristic of a subgroup of offenders who are more likely to commit severe and repeated domestic assault. This reanalysis of 1,421 police reports of domestic violence by men found that 6% used a weapon during the assault and 8% had access to firearms. We expected that firearm use would be rare compared to other weapons and that actual weapon use rather than firearm access would increase the severity of domestic assaults. Firearm access was associated with assault severity, but this was mostly attributable to use of nonfirearm weapons. Weapon use was associated with older age, lower education, and relationship history as well as to assault severity. Victims were most concerned about future assaults following threats and actual injuries. Although firearm access and weapon use were related to actuarial risk of domestic violence recidivism, neither predicted the occurrence or severity of recidivism. We conclude that, consistent with previous research in the United States and Canada, firearm use in domestic violence is uncommon even among offenders with known firearm access. Weapon use is characteristic of a subgroup of offenders who commit more severe domestic violence, and seizure of weapons may be an effective intervention.

The Continuation of Intimate Partner Violence From Adolescence to Young Adulthood

Author: Cui, Ming1; Ueno, Koji; Gordon, Mellissa; Fincham, Frank D1 The Florida State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704114?accountid=14925

Abstract: Little attention has been paid to whether violence in adolescent romantic relationships is associated with relationship violence later in young adulthood. This study examined the continuation of intimate partner violence (IPV) from adolescence to young adulthood. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, results from negative binomial models and propensity score models showed that being victimized by relationship partners in adolescence was significantly associated with both perpetration and victimization in romantic relationships in young adulthood. Women reported higher levels of perpetration and lower levels of victimization than men did. Those who were living together (married or cohabiting) reported higher levels of victimization and perpetration than those who were dating. Further, such associations existed beyond the effects of parent-child violence and general aggression tendencies, suggesting the continuation of relationship-specific violence. Finally, these patterns persisted after controlling for participants' age, race and ethnicity, parental education, and family structure. Adapted from the source document.

Why Do We Fail to Ask "Why" About Gender and Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Anderson, Kristin L11 Western Washington University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704129?accountid=14925

Abstract: Many of us may be tired of the gender issue in domestic violence research. Controversy about whether men are more violent than women in dating, cohabitating, and marital relationships has dogged the field for over 40 years (Kimmel, 2002). Although there have been calls for compromise (Hamby, 2009), positions on both sides of the issue have become entrenched and the likelihood of resolution seems dim (DeKeseredy & Dragiewicz, 2007; Dutton & Nicholls, 2005; Reed, Raj, Miller & Silverman, 2010; Straus, 2009). In this commentary, I propose that the debate has lingered because of the failure to take gender seriously as a theoretical problem. We've spent too much time arguing about the "who is more violent" question and too little time examining the "why does gender matter" question. Adapted from the source document.

What Comes Before Why: Specifying the Phenomenon of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Fincham, Frank D1; Cui, Ming; Gordon, Mellissa; Ueno, Koji1 The Florida State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704249?accountid=14925

Abstract: In our article, "The Continuation of Intimate Partner Violence from Adolescence to Young Adulthood" (Cui, Ueno, Gordon, & Fincham, 2013), we found that being victimized by relationship partners in adolescence was significantly associated with both perpetration and victimization in romantic relationships in young adulthood. Though not our primary focus, we included gender as a covariate and tested its main effect on young adult intimate partner violence (IPV). The results showed that women reported higher levels of perpetration and lower levels of victimization than men did. We appreciate Kristin Anderson's (2013) commentary on this finding and agree with many of her observations. In particular, finding a resolution to the seemingly endless polemic about gender issues in IPV would be most welcome. As Carney, Buttell, and Dutton (2007) pointed out, this is "a debate that has been troubling for feminists since the first U.S. National Family Violence Survey of 1975 found women to be as violent as men" (p. 108). Since that first survey, more studies have suggested that the rate of female perpetration is equivalent to or exceeds that of male perpetration (Archer, 2000; Dutton, 2006; Gelles, 1972; Kimmel, 2002; Stets & Straus, 1992; Williams & Frieze, 2005), including some that used the same data set as we did (e.g., Whitaker, Haileyesus, Swahn, & Saltzman, 2007). But the findings on female perpetration have often been explained as women engaging in self-defense or as due to gender-biased reporting (see Carney et al., 2007). Unfortunately, history shows that better research is unlikely to resolve matters in this highly politicized arena. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The peer context is a central focus in research on adolescent risk behaviors but few studies have investigated the role of the peer context in the perpetration of adolescent dating violence. This longitudinal study examined between-subjects and within-person contemporaneous and lagged effects of peer attributes, measured with social network analyses, on trajectories of dating violence perpetration and determined if effects varied by grade and/or sex of the adolescent. Data are from adolescents who participated in a five-wave panel study beginning when they were in 7 through 9th grade and ending when they were in 10 through 12th grade (n = 3,412); half were male, 40.5 % were white, 49.9 % were black and 10.4 % were of another race/ethnicity. Significant between-subjects effects indicate that adolescents who typically have friends who use dating violence, and girls who are typically high in social status, are at increased risk for using dating violence throughout adolescence. Adolescents who typically have high quality friendships and girls who typically have friends with pro-social beliefs are at decreased risk for using dating violence throughout adolescence. Significant within-person contemporaneous effects indicate that both boys and girls reported lower levels of dating violence than usual at times when they had more friends with pro-social beliefs, and reported higher levels of dating violence than usual at times when they had higher social status. None of the lagged effects were significant and none of the effects varied across grade. These findings suggest that the peer context plays an important role in the development of the perpetration of adolescent dating violence. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Past research has shown that adolescent peer groups make a significant contribution to shaping behavior but less is known about the role of peer groups in adolescent dating relationships. This longitudinal study examined the contribution of aggressive peer group norms on relationship quality and dating violence among dating adolescents. At the beginning of the school year (T1) and 6 months later (T2), participants (n = 1,070; M sub(age) = 15.45; 49 % Female) provided self-reports of attitudes towards aggression, and physically- and relationally-aggressive behaviors. Peer groups were identified using a peer-nomination technique and aggressive behaviors and attitudes were averaged across peer groups. Participants with dating experience (n = 598) reported on the frequency of their experience with dating violence (both as a victim and perpetrator). Multilevel analyses indicated that peer group relational aggression at T1 positively predicted dating abuse victimization and perpetration, and negatively predicted relationship quality at T2, beyond individual predictions. An unexpected finding was that membership in physically aggressive peer groups at T1 was associated positively with relationship quality at T2. Results point to the importance of the peer group in shaping adolescent dating experiences.

The Impact of Collective Efficacy on Risks for Adolescents' Perpetration of Dating Violence

Author: Schnurr, Melissa P1; Lohman, Brenda J1 Department of Human Development, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, 2420 Nicolet Drive, MAC C321, Green Bay, WI, 54311, USA, blohman@iastate.edu

Abstract: Given prevalence rates and negative consequences that adolescents' perpetration of dating violence may have on an individual's well-being and future relationships, it is imperative to explore factors that may increase or reduce its occurrence. Thus, we aimed to identify how multiple contextual risk factors (individual, family, schools, and neighborhoods) were related to adolescents' perpetration of dating violence over a 6 year period. Then, we assessed how neighborhood collective efficacy, an important predictor of urban youths' well-being, buffered the relationship between each of the risk factors and adolescents' perpetration of dating violence. Three waves of data from the Welfare, Children, and Families: A Three-City Study were used (N = 765; Ages 16-20 at Wave 3). The sample is 53 % female, 42 % African-American, and 53 % Hispanic. For the total sample, drug and alcohol use, low parental monitoring, academic difficulties, and involvement with antisocial peers were significant early risk factors for perpetration of dating violence in late adolescence. Risk factors also varied by adolescents' race and sex. Finally, perceived neighborhood collective efficacy buffered the relationship between early academic difficulties and later perpetration of dating violence for Hispanic males. These results imply that multiple systems should be addressed in dating violence prevention programs.

Individual and Family Predictors of the Perpetration of Dating Violence and Victimization in Late Adolescence

Author: Makin-Byrd, Kerry1; Bierman, Karen L1 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA, kerrymb@nyu.edu

Abstract: Teen dating violence is a crime of national concern with approximately one-fourth of adolescents reporting victimization of physical, psychological, or sexual dating violence each year. The present study examined how aggressive family dynamics in both childhood and early adolescence predicted the perpetration of dating violence and victimization in late adolescence. Children (n = 401, 43 % female) were followed from kindergarten entry to the age of 18 years. Early adolescent aggressive-oppositional problems at home and aggressive-oppositional problems at school each made unique predictions to the emergence of dating violence in late adolescence. The results suggest that aggressive family dynamics during childhood and early adolescence influence the development of dating violence primarily by fostering a child's oppositional-aggressive responding style initially in the home, which is then generalized to other contexts. Although this study is limited by weaknesses detailed in the discussion, the contribution of longitudinal evidence including parent, teacher, and adolescent reports from both boys and girls, a dual-emphasis on the prediction of perpetration and victimization, as well as an analysis of both relations between variables and person-oriented group comparisons combine to make a unique contribution to the growing literature on adolescent partner violence.

Trajectories of Physical Dating Violence from Middle to High School: Association with Relationship Quality and Acceptability of Aggression

Abstract: Although research on dating violence is growing, little is known about the distinct developmental trajectories of dating violence during adolescence. The current study identifies trajectories of physical dating violence victimization and perpetration that boys and girls follow from sixth to twelfth grade, examines the overlap of these trajectories, and characterizes them by perceptions of a caring dating relationship and acceptability of dating aggression. The sample consisted of randomly selected sixth graders from nine schools in Northeast Georgia (n = 588; 52 % boys; 49 % White, 36 % African American, 12 % Latino) who completed yearly surveys from Grades 6-12. We used latent class mixture modeling to identify the trajectories and generalized estimating equations models to examine the acceptability of dating aggression by dating violence trajectories. Participants followed two trajectories of dating violence victimization (boys: low and high; girls: low and increasing) and two of perpetration (boys and girls: low and increasing). When examining the joint trajectories of victimization and perpetration, a similar proportion of boys (62 %) and girls (65 %) were in the low victimization and low perpetration group and reported the lowest acceptance of dating aggression. The same proportion of boys and girls (27 %) were in the high/increasing victimization and perpetration group, and reported the highest acceptance of dating aggression. However, acceptance of dating aggression decreased from Grade 6-12 for all groups, even for those whose trajectory of dating violence increased. Victimization and perpetration were associated with reporting a less caring dating relationship. Results highlight the importance of focusing prevention efforts early for adolescents who follow this increasing probability of physical dating violence.

Predictors of Latent Trajectory Classes of Physical Dating Violence Victimization

Abstract: This study identified classes of developmental trajectories of physical dating violence victimization from grades 8 to 12 and examined theoretically-based risk factors that distinguished among trajectory classes. Data were from a multi-wave longitudinal study spanning 8th through 12th grade (n = 2,566; 51.9 % female). Growth mixture models were used to identify trajectory classes of physical dating violence victimization separately for girls and boys. Logistic and multinomial logistic regressions were used to identify situational and target vulnerability factors associated with the trajectory classes. For girls, three trajectory classes were identified: a low/non-involved class; a moderate class where victimization increased slightly until the 10th grade and then decreased through the 12th grade; and a high class where victimization started at a higher level in the 8th grade, increased substantially until the 10th grade, and then decreased until the 12th grade. For males, two classes were identified: a low/non-involved class, and a victimized class where victimization increased slightly until the 9th grade, decreased until the 11th grade, and then increased again through the 12th grade. In bivariate analyses, almost all of the situational and target vulnerability risk factors distinguished the victimization classes from the non-involved classes. However, when all risk factors and control variables were in the model, alcohol use (a situational vulnerability) was the only factor that distinguished membership in the moderate trajectory class from the non-involved class for girls; anxiety and being victimized by peers (target vulnerability factors) were the factors that distinguished the high from the non-involved classes for the girls; and victimization by peers was the only factor distinguishing the victimized from the non-involved class for boys. These findings contribute to our understanding of the heterogeneity in physical dating violence victimization during adolescence and the malleable risk factors associated with each trajectory class for boys and girls.

Substance Use as a Longitudinal Predictor of the Perpetration of Teen Dating Violence

Author: Temple, Jeff R1; Shorey, Ryan C; Fite, Paula; Stuart, Gregory L; Le, Vi Donna1 Behavioral Health and Research, Department of Ob/Gyn, UTMB Health, 301 University Blvd, Galveston, TX, 77555-0587, USA, jetemple@utmb.edu

Abstract: The prevention of teen dating violence is a major public health priority. However, the dearth of longitudinal studies makes it difficult to develop programs that effectively target salient risk factors. Using a school-based sample of ethnically diverse adolescents, this longitudinal study examined whether substance use (alcohol, marijuana, and hard drugs) and exposure to parental violence predicted the perpetration of physical dating violence over time. 1,042 9th and 10th grade high schools students were recruited and assessed in the spring of 2010, and 93 % of the original sample completed the 1-year follow-up in the spring of 2011. Participants who had begun dating at the initial assessment and who self-identified as African American (n = 263; 32 %), Caucasian (n = 272; 33 %), or Hispanic (n = 293; 35 %) were included in the current analyses (n = 828; 55 % female). Slightly more than half of the adolescents who perpetrated dating violence at baseline reported past year dating violence at follow-up, relative to only 11 % of adolescents who did not report perpetrating dating violence at baseline. Structural equation modeling revealed that the use of alcohol and hard drugs at baseline predicted the future perpetration of physical dating violence, even after accounting for the effects of baseline dating violence and exposure to interparental violence. Despite differences in the prevalence of key variables between males and females, the longitudinal associations did not vary by gender. With respect to race, exposure to mother-to-father violence predicted the perpetration of dating violence among Caucasian adolescents. Findings from the current study indicate that targeting substance use, and potentially youth from violent households, may be viable approaches to preventing the perpetration of teen dating violence.

Abstract: Although there is growing recognition of the problem of dating violence, little is known about how it unfolds among young adolescents who are just beginning to date. This study examined classes (subgroups) and transitions between classes over three time points based on dating violence, bullying, and sexual harassment perpetration and victimization experienced by youth. The sample was ethnically diverse, consisting of 795 seventh-grade students from schools that were part of a multi-site, longitudinal evaluation of a dating violence initiative (50 % female; 27 % White, 32 % African American, 25 % Latino, 16 % other or multiple races). Results from latent transition analyses revealed five classes of students with distinct behavioral profiles: multi-problem (victimization and perpetration), bullying and sexual harassment (victimization and perpetration), bullying (victimization and perpetration) and sexual harassment (victimization only), bullying (victimization and perpetration), and a least problem group. The majority of classes were characterized by reports of both perpetration and victimization for at least one behavior. Girls were more likely to be in the less problematic classes. Class membership was fairly stable across the three time points. When students transitioned to a different class, the shift was most often from a more problematic to a less problematic class, particularly for girls. The findings support understanding dating violence within a dynamic, developmental process that recognizes related behaviors within and across individuals. Overall, the findings highlight the utility of person-oriented approaches to enhance our understanding of longitudinal profiles and transitions over time for dating violence and related behaviors.

The Interplay Between Interpersonal Stress and Psychological Intimate Partner Violence Over Time for Young At-Risk Couples

Author: Shortt, Joann Wu1; Capaldi, Deborah M; Kim, Hyoun K; Tiberio, Stacey S1 Oregon Social Learning Center, 10 Shelton McMurphey Blvd., Eugene, OR, 97401, USA

Abstract: The substantial number of young people in romantic relationships that involve intimate partner violence, a situation deleterious to physical and mental health, has resulted in increased attention to understanding the links between risk factors and course of violence. The current study examined couples' interpersonal stress related to not liking partners' friends and not getting along with parents as contextual factors associated with couples' psychological partner violence and determined whether and when couples' friend and parent stress increased the likelihood of couples' psychological partner violence. A linear latent growth curve modeling approach was used with multiwave measures of psychological partner violence, friend stress, parent stress, and relationship satisfaction obtained from 196 men at risk for delinquency and their women partners over a 12-year period. At the initial assessment, on average, the men were age 21.5 years and the women were age 21 years. Findings indicated that couples experiencing high levels of friend and parent stress were more likely to engage in high levels of psychological partner violence and that increases in couples' friend stress predicted increases in couples' partner violence over time, even when accounting for the couples' relationship satisfaction, marital status, children in the home, and financial strain. Interactive effects were at play when the couples were in their early 20s, with couples being most at risk for increases in psychological partner violence if they experienced both high friend stress and low relationship satisfaction. Couples' friend stress had the greatest effect on psychological partner violence when the couples were in their early to mid 20s when levels of friend stress were high. As the couples reached their 30s, low relationship satisfaction became the leading predictor of couples' psychological partner violence. Adapted from the source document.

Beyond Correlates: A Review of Risk and Protective Factors for Adolescent Dating Violence Perpetration

Author: Vagi, Kevin J1; Rothman, Emily F; Latzman, Natasha E; Tharp, Andra Teten; Hall, Diane M; Breiding, Matthew J1 Division of Violence Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford Hwy. NE, MS F-63, Atlanta, GA, 30341, USA kvagi@cdc.gov

Abstract: Dating violence is a serious public health problem. In recent years, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other entities have made funding available to community based agencies for dating violence prevention. Practitioners who are tasked with developing dating violence prevention strategies should pay particular attention to risk and protective factors for dating violence perpetration that have been established in longitudinal studies. This has been challenging to date because the scientific literature on the etiology of dating violence is somewhat limited, and because there have been no comprehensive reviews of the literature that clearly distinguish correlates of dating violence perpetration from risk or protective factors that have been established through longitudinal research. This is problematic because prevention programs may then target factors that are merely correlated with dating violence perpetration, and have no causal influence, which could potentially limit the effectiveness of the programs. In this article, we review the literature on risk and protective factors for adolescent dating violence perpetration and highlight those factors for which temporal precedence has been established by one or more studies. This review is intended as a guide for researchers and practitioners as they formulate prevention programs. We reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2010 that reported on adolescent dating violence perpetration using samples from the United States or Canada. In total, 53 risk factors and six protective factors were identified from 20 studies. Next steps for etiological research in adolescent dating violence are discussed, as well as future directions for prevention program developers. Adapted from the source document.

Actuarial risk assessment in sexually motivated intimate-partner violence

Author: Rettenberger, Martin; Eher, Reinhard

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1641424389?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study is the first independent cross-validation of the Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment (ODARA) and the Domestic Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (DVRAG) using an incarcerated high-risk sample (N = 66) of offenders released from the Austrian Prison System who have committed at least one sexually motivated offense against their actual or former intimate partners. The mean follow -up period was approximately 55 months. Both instruments showed evidence for their reliability and predictive accuracy, supporting the cross-cultural transferability of these risk assessment instruments. For the prediction of domestic violence recidivism, ODARA and DVRAG yield good predictive accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC = .71), and for general criminal and general violent recidivism, both instruments exhibit moderate effect sizes (AUC = .66-.71). Also, the results provide evidence for the discriminant validity of the ODARA. When examining the association between individual ODARA items and recidivism, only a few items were found to be related to domestic violence recidivism. The integration of the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) does not add any incremental predictive accuracy to the ODARA, suggesting that ODARA items capture antisocial and psychopathic traits sufficiently even in incarcerated high-risk offenders. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Research on the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and postpartum depression (PPD) is limited. Numerous antecedents and consequences of both IPV and PPD are noted in the literature; however, understanding the mechanisms by which intimate partner violence impacts the postpartum mood are not clearly understood. This study utilized retrospective chart reviews from a pediatric/perinatal social work outreach program to explore urban minority women experiences with IPV and depression both during pregnancy and after. Findings do not suggest a direct relationship between IPV and PPD; however, there was a high co-occurrence of prenatal depression and PPD. The severity of IPV appears to influence the occurrence and acuity of prenatal depression suggesting an indirect relationship. Implications for health and social work practitioners are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence, Depression, PTSD, and Use of Mental Health Resources Among Ethnically Diverse Black Women

Author: Sabri, Bushra1; Bolyard, Richelle; McFadgion, Akosoa L; Stockman, Jamila K; Lucea, Marguerite B; Callwood, Gloria B; Coverston, Catherine R; Campbell, Jacquelyn C1 Post-Doctoral Fellow, 816 N. Washington Street, Baltimore, MD 21205 bushrasahri@gmail.com

Abstract: This study examined exposure to violence and risk for lethality in intimate partner relationships as factors related to co-occurring MH problems and use of mental health (MH) resources among women of African descent. Black women with intimate partner violence (IPV) experiences (n = 431) were recruited from primary care, prenatal or family planning clinics in the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Severity of IPV was significantly associated with co-occurring MH problems, but was not associated with the use of MH resources among African-American women. Risk for lethality and co-occurring problems were also not significantly related to the use of resources. African Caribbean women with severe physical abuse experiences were significantly less likely to use resources. In contrast, severity of physical abuse was positively associated with the use of resources among Black women with mixed ethnicity. Severe IPV experiences are risk factors for co-occurring MH problems, which in turn, increases the need for MH services. However, Black women may not seek help for MH problems. Thus, social work practitioners in health care settings must thoroughly assess women for their IPV experiences and develop tailored treatment plans that address their abuse histories and MH needs.

Abstract: The dangerousness of domestic violence escalates when suspects use weapons against victims or responding officers. Nevertheless, only a few studies have examined the dynamics of weapon use in domestic violence. While supporting the situational approach, the limited literature and relevant theories suggest the need for weapons classification and multilevel research. Using over 9,400 domestic violence cases across 423 census tracts that were responded to by the Houston Police Department in 2005, hierarchical linear models examine the correlates of weapon use by suspects. Results indicate that situational and neighborhood factors are distinctively associated with each type of weapon. Implications for future research and policy are discussed.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of interpersonal violence and substance use to the prediction of postpartum depressive symptomatology. A community-based sample of 634 women in British Columbia, Canada was screened for interpersonal violence and substance use using the Antenatal Psychosocial Health Assessment (ALPHA) form. Of these women, 497 (78%) subsequently completed questionnaires at 8 weeks postpartum to assess for depressive symptomatology using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). A predictive model for postpartum depressive symptomatology (EPDS > 9) was developed using regression analysis. Findings suggest that women who experience past or current interpersonal violence or personal or partner substance use problems should be considered for targeted screening for postpartum depression (PPD).

Predicting Shelter Residence in Women Experiencing Recent Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Galano, Maria M1; Hunter, Erin C; Howell, Kathryn H; Miller, Laura E; Graham-Bermann, Sandra A1 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463012555?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study sought to determine factors associated with shelter residence in women with recent histories of intimate partner violence (IPV). The sample included 113 women, approximately half of whom resided in a shelter over the past year. Participating women provided demographic information and completed standardized measures of IPV, trauma, and depression. Ethnicity, income, housing stability, and mental health, but not violence exposure, differentiated the shelter and community groups. Trauma symptoms, housing instability, and ethnicity best predicted shelter residence. Future research should focus on determining what types of services and interventions will best address the unique needs of each population.

"They Arrested Me-And I Was the Victim": Women's Experiences With Getting Arrested in the Context of Domestic Violence

Author: Dichter, Melissa E11 Center for Health Equity Research & Promotion, Philadelphia VA Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA mdichter@sp2.upenn.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364703234?accountid=14925

Abstract: Since the implementation of mandatory and pro-arrest policies, there has been a sharp increase in the number of women arrested for violence against intimate partners; many of these women are also victims of intimate partner violence (IPV). Through questionnaires and interviews, this study uncovers the experience of getting arrested from the perspective of women who were both victims of IPV and arrested in IPV-related incidents. Women reported that their arrest was unexpected, led to multiple losses and collateral consequences, and served as a turning point in their relationships. Findings support emergency intervention services that include alternatives to arrest for women experiencing IPV. Adapted from the source document.

When Abuse Happens Again: Women's Reasons for Not Reporting New Incidents of Intimate Partner Abuse to Law Enforcement

Author: Gover, Angela R1; Welton-Mitchell, Courtney; Belknap, Joanne; Deprince, Anne P1 School of Public Affairs, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, Colorado, USA angela.gover@ucdenver.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364703245?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although most women abused by intimate partners experience a patterned behavior of abuse (by either the same or new partners), little is known about their decision making regarding whether to call the police for subsequent abuse. The current study found that 90 percent of women who had encountered the criminal legal system for previous intimate partner abuse victimizations did not contact the police for some or all recurrences. Qualitative analysis was conducted among a sample of 102 women regarding their reasons for not re-engaging the legal system for subsequent victimizations. The results suggested 5 overall reasons as to why women involved with the criminal legal system choose not to engage the system again. Adapted from the source document.

Prospective Association of Intimate Partner Violence with Receipt of Clinical Preventive Services in Women of Reproductive Age

Author: McCall-Hosenfeld, Jennifer S; Chuang, Cynthia H; Weisman, Carol S

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1373428818?accountid=14925

Abstract: Background: Women who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) have a greater risk for adverse health outcomes, suggesting the importance of preventive services in this group. Little prior research has explored how IPV exposure impacts receipt of relevant preventive services. We assess the prospective association of IPV exposure with receiving specific preventive services. Methods: Women in the Central Pennsylvania Women's Health Study's longitudinal cohort study (conducted 2004-2007; n = 1,420) identified past-year exposure to IPV at baseline and receipt of IPV-relevant preventive services (counseling for safety and violence concerns, tests for sexually transmitted infections [STIs], counseling for STIs, Pap testing, counseling for smoking/tobacco use, alcohol/drug use, and birth control) at 2-year follow-up. Multiple logistic regression analysis assessed the impact of IPV on service receipt, controlling for relevant covariates. Findings: Women exposed to IPV had greater odds of receiving safety and violence counseling (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-4.61), and tests for STIs (AOR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.41-4.28) compared with women who had not been exposed to IPV. Independent of other predictors, including IPV, women who saw an obstetrician-gynecologist were more likely to receive Pap tests, STI/HIV testing and counseling, and birth control counseling, compared with women who had not seen an obstetrician-gynecologist. Conclusions: Overall rates of preventive service receipt for all women in the sample were low. Women exposed to IPV were more likely to receive safety and violence counseling and STI testing, and seeing an obstetrician-gynecologist increased the odds of receiving several preventive services.

Professional Efficacy and Working With Victims of Domestic Violence or Sexual Assault

Author: Warrener, Corinne1; Postmus, Judy L; McMahon, Sarah1 Center on Violence Against Women, School of Social Work, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA cwarrener@ssw.rutgers.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554381?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence against women is a pervasive and widespread problem, but the understanding of how to prepare social workers best for working with survivors is inadequate. One area of focus is professional efficacy, which stems from the literature on self-efficacy. This article focuses on the confidence and comfort that social work students have in working with survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and identifies the factors that affect professional efficacy among these students. The results indicate that age, professional experience, master of social work education, and training have a positive impact on professional efficacy.

Child Maltreatment Victimization and Subsequent Perpetration of Young Adult Intimate Partner Violence: An Exploration of Mediating Factors

Author: Millett, Lina S1; Kohl, Patricia L; Jonson-Reid, Melissa; Drake, Brett; Petra, Megan1 Brown School of Social Work, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA lmillett@gwbmail.wustl.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417523283?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined whether young adults with documented histories of Child Maltreatment had higher records of documented severe intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration than an income-matched control group. It also examined whether this association was mediated by juvenile violent delinquency, problematic substance use, or mental health problems. Study data came from one state's administrative public sector records of child welfare, juvenile court, mental health, income maintenance, and birth records. The study employed a prospective longitudinal design to follow children for 16 years (N = 5,377). The IPV was measured by police arrests and temporary restraining order petitions. Multiple group path analysis was used to examine mediation hypotheses and determine whether they differed by gender. The study found that IPV perpetration rates were higher among maltreated than control participants and higher in maltreated men than in women. For men, maltreatment had both direct and mediated effects on IPV perpetration through violent delinquency. For women, maltreatment did not directly or indirectly predict IPV perpetration, though low power makes these findings tentative. The study highlights the importance of Child Maltreatment prevention as a way to reduce violence later in life and suggests that the juvenile justice system may also provide a point of intervention for the maltreated youth.

The rule of law at time of masculine honor: Afghan police attitudes and intimate partner violence

Author: Baldry, Anna Costanza1; Pagliaro, Stefano; Porcaro, Cesare1 Second University of Naples, Italy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463464410?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examines how attitudes toward violence against women (VAW)-in terms of justification-influence the behavioral intentions of Afghan police officers when dealing with a case of intimate partner violence (IPV). An experimental study was carried out with 108 Afghan police officers who took part in a training course at the NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan (NTM-A) bases in Herat and Kandahar. Participants read an extract of a police intervention for an IPV case. They were faced with honor-related attitudes and possible actions to be taken to help victims and arrest perpetrators. In the experimental condition, in the questionnaire provided to police officers, there was reference to the victim admitting to an affair with another man. No such reference was present in the control condition. Results showed that admitting an infidelity produced more lenient attitudes toward the violence against the woman, which in turn reduced police officers' intention to intervene by arresting the man and providing support to the victim. Results are discussed in terms of the role and function of the so-called culture of (masculine) honor and the rule of law and its implications.

Perpetration of intimate partner violence by young adult males: The association with alcohol outlet density and drinking behavior

Author: Waller, Martha W; Iritani, Bonita J; Christ, Sharon L; Tucker Halpern, Carolyn; Moracco, Kathryn E; Flewelling, Robert L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438556116?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: This study examined the association between alcohol outlet density and male to female intimate partner violence (IPV). Methods: Data were analyzed from a national probability sample of males who reported a current heterosexual relationship (N=3194). Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the likelihood of having perpetrated IPV. Results: High alcohol outlet density was associated with having perpetrated physical only IPV (odds ratio [OR]=2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-5.20). Outlet density was not associated with greater odds of sexual IPV perpetration. Conclusions: Alcohol outlet density was found to be associated with perpetration of physical IPV. Developing environmental strategies with respect to alcohol outlets could potentially reduce perpetration of male-to-female physical IPV. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

(Mis)managed Empowerment: Exploring Paradoxes of Practice in Domestic Violence Prevention

Author: D'Enbeau, Suzy; Kunkel, Adrianne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429629036?accountid=14925

Abstract: Empowerment approaches to domestic violence prevention are gaining in popularity because of their commitment to individualized care and recognition that the survivor is the expert of her own life. However, organizations charged with empowering survivors of domestic violence confront paradoxes when putting empowerment theory into practice. To better understand how practitioners address paradoxes of practice, we take a grounded practical theory approach to explore how one domestic violence prevention organization discursively constructs and enacts empowerment in organizational life. Our analysis reveals two paradoxes of practice: (1) a paradox of consistency, and (2) a paradox of transparency. Both paradoxes inform and constrain social change organizing. This study's practical promise is revealed in the discursive strategies employed by organizational members to bridge the gap between empowerment in theory and empowerment in practice. Adapted from the source document.

Speaking for Themselves: Hope for Children Caught in High Conflict Custody and Access Disputes Involving Domestic Violence

Author: Fotheringham, Sarah1; Dunbar, Jean; Hensley, Dale1 YWCA of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429623252?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Speaking for Themselves (SFT) project sought to enhance the physical, emotional, and psychological safety of children exposed to domestic violence and high conflict custody and access disputes. Children were provided with both a trauma therapist and a lawyer, in an attempt to ensure their well-being while providing decision-makers with reliable and authentic information about these children's circumstances. This project was an attempt to balance the "best interests" approach applied in family law decision-making with the value placed on a child's right to be heard, an approach espoused by children's rights advocates. This article presents the SFT philosophy, model program, and evaluation results. Adapted from the source document.

Relationship Between Intimate Partner Violence, Depressive Symptomatology, and Personality Traits

Abstract: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and personality disorder symptoms controlling for depressive state. Victims of IPV (n=176) and non-abused women (n=193) completed the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ), Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA), and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). IPV victims scored higher than non-abused women on Intimacy Problems, and scored lower on Rejection traits, after adjustment for depressive symptoms. Severity of the IPV was related to Cognitive Distortion, Suspiciousness, Restricted Expression, and Intimacy Problems, and the length of the IPV was negatively associated with Rejection. The current study suggests only modest differences in personality traits between IPV and non-abused women. The DAPP-BQ traits associated with severity of IPV, in a dose-response manner, would partially reflect the symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), although this possibility deserves further study.

Social Workers' Attitudes towards Intimate Partner Abuse in Younger vs. Older Women

Author: Yechezkel, Rachely1; Ayalon, Liat1 Louis and Gabi Weisfeld School of Social Work, Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan, 52900, Israel, liatayalon0@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463482178?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner abuse is defined as threatened or actual physical, sexual, or psychological abuse by a current or former partner. The present study examined responses of 212 social workers, who were randomly assigned one of four case vignettes describing intimate partner abuse. Vignettes varied by age of perpetrator and victim (elderly vs. young) and type of abuse (emotional vs. physical). Social workers tended to define intimate partner abuse against an elderly woman as non-abusive, in contrast to intimate partner abuse against a young woman. As a rule, social workers tended to favor therapeutic interventions more than legal interventions. However, in the case of intimate partner abuse against an elderly woman, social workers tended to prefer legal interventions. Specific training designed to help social workers to better understand their own ageist attitudes (i.e., age related discrimination) should supplement the training of social workers.

Post-Relationship Stalking: The Experience of Victims With and Without History of Partner Abuse

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429624550?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article analyses a side of the post-relationship stalking that has been neglected: the experience of women that were victims of this type of violence without having any history of abuse during their prior relationship. It analyses the differences between post-relationship stalking victims with and without history of partner abuse on what concerns to suffered stalking dynamics, emotional answers and types of coping strategies. This survey gathered data using online resources and the sample was constituted by 107 female post-intimate stalking victims. Results revealed that victims who were targets of past violence suffered a more serious post-relationship stalking campaign. Results also demonstrated that fear towards stalking behaviours is an endemic response when dealing with such experiences. Post-relationship stalking victims, in general, have also revealed being actives in coping with their individual experiences of victimisation. Adapted from the source document.

Factors Contributing to Ongoing Intimate Partner Abuse: Childhood Betrayal Trauma and Dependence on One's Perpetrator

Author: Babcock, Rebecca L1; DePrince, Anne P1 University of Denver, Denver, CO, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554851?accountid=14925

Abstract: Identifying the factors that contribute to ongoing intimate partner abuse (IPA) among survivors of childhood abuse is essential to developing appropriate interventions. The current study assessed prospectively whether childhood betrayal trauma (BT) history and women's potential dependence on their perpetrators (unemployment, number of children below 13) increased women's risk of ongoing victimization, while controlling for trauma-related symptoms (PTSD, depression, dissociation). Women survivors of IPA (N = 190) from an urban U.S. city were recruited based on an IPA incident reported to the police. At the initial interview, women reported on childhood betrayal trauma experiences, their employment status, number of children, and current trauma-related symptoms. Women returned 6 months later and reported on ongoing events of victimization (physical, sexual, psychological aggression, and injury) in their relationships with the initial IPA perpetrator. Results showed that higher levels of childhood BT were associated with ongoing victimization over the course of 6 months. Women's unemployment status predicted greater physical and sexual aggression and injuries. Higher levels of depression and lower levels of PTSD symptoms were also associated with increases in physical, sexual, and psychological aggression, and bodily injury. The findings have important implications for interventions by demonstrating the need to process women's betrayal trauma experiences, target depression symptoms, and increase women's economic opportunities to prevent further victimization.

Abstract: Background: Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) involves behavior that causes physical, psychological, or sexual harm, and has significant health consequences. Given the prevalence of and impact of IPV, various organizations recommend routine IPV screening for women by health-care professionals. Objective: We investigated the feasibility of screening women for IPV at a hospital in India. Specifically, we assessed prevalence of IPV, method of questionnaire administration, response rate, availability of IPV related community services for referrals, environment of screening, and explored perspectives of health professionals regarding in-hospital screening. Study Design: We administered two questionnaires to consenting women; the Composite Abuse Scale (CAS) and Woman Abuse Screening Tool (WAST). Health professionals involved in conducting the study and in managing care for patients were also interviewed. Results: Forty-seven patients were enrolled in the study. The most reported injury was fractures (39% [CI 25%-54%]) and the greatest proportion involved spine and neck (28% [CI 16%-43%]). Prevalence of IPV was 30% [CI 17%-45%] according to the WAST and 40% [CI 26%-56%] according to the CAS. A majority of the participants used self-report as the method of questionnaire administration. Additionally, the self-report group had greater disclosure than the interview-administered group. The environment at this private hospital was considered adequate for screening and we found several IPV support networks in the community. However, health professionals were reluctant to screen for IPV. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that screening for IPV at an orthopaedic clinic in India is feasible.

Risk and Protective Factors of Same-Sex Intimate Partner Violence in Hong Kong

Author: Chong, Eddie SK1; Mak, Winnie WS; Kwong, Mabel MF1 The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong

Abstract: Numerous studies have assessed risk and protective factors for intimate partner violence (IPV) among heterosexual couples around the globe. Nevertheless, few have addressed the same issue among same-sex couples, especially in cultures where same-sex intimate relationships have gained little acceptance. This exploratory study evaluated the substantial risk and protective factors for same-sex IPV based on gender-neutral theories. Three hundred and six Hong Kong residents who have been in a same-sex romantic relationship completed a web-based questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses indicated that relationship conflict and poor anger management were risk factors both of psychological and physical perpetration. Dominance and substance abuse were respectively associated with psychological aggression and physical battering despite their small effect sizes. Psychological aggression was also found to mediate the relationship between conflict and physical assault, and that between anger management and physical assault. Interventions related to the array of risk and protective factors were discussed and recommended.

The Average Predictive Validity of Intimate Partner Violence Risk Assessment Instruments

Author: Messing, Jill Theresa1; Thaller, Jonel1 Arizona State University, Phoenix AZ, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554936?accountid=14925

Abstract: The field of intimate partner violence (IPV) risk assessment (predicting recidivism, lethality) is fast growing, and the majority of research examining the predictive validity of IPV risk assessment instruments has been conducted in the past decade. This study examines the average predictive validity weighted by sample size of five stand alone IPV risk assessment instruments that have been validated in multiple research studies using the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (AUC). The Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment (ODARA) has the highest average weighted AUC (=.666, k=5) followed, in order of most to least predictive, by the Spousal Assault Risk Assessment (SARA; AUC=.628, k=6), the Danger Assessment (DA; AUC=.618, k=4), the Domestic Violence Screening Inventory (DVSI; AUC=.582, k=3), and the Kingston Screening Instrument for Domestic Violence (K-SID; AUC=.537, k=2). The effect size for the average AUCs for IPV risk assessment instruments is small, with the exception of a medium effect size for the ODARA. Of the 20 measures of predictive validity included in this analysis, the risk assessment was administered correctly in nine (45%). IPV risk assessment is relatively new, and the use of proxy instruments and utilization of risk assessment instruments in settings for which they were not created is widespread. While waiting for a more rigorous body of research, factors in addition to predictive validity must be taken into consideration (e.g., setting, outcome, skills of the assessor, access to information) when choosing which risk assessment instrument is appropriate for use in a particular practice setting.

Gender and Intimate Partner Violence: Does Dual Arrest Reveal Gender Symmetry or Asymmetry?

Author: Gerstenberger, Caryn Bell1; Williams, Kirk R1 University of California, Riverside, CA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554949?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) has ignited considerable controversy about gender and IPV. Feminist scholars have viewed IPV as a manifestation of male dominance and control, with women primarily the victims and men primarily the perpetrators of this behavior (gender asymmetry). Conversely, family violence researchers have viewed IPV as emerging from conflicts in relationships, with both men and women being involved (gender symmetry). The present study was framed within the context of this controversy using new empirical evidence on one person arrested (single arrest) or both persons arrested (dual arrest) in IPV incidents. Data were acquired on the assessed risk of IPV recidivism immediately after arrest and actual IPV recidivism over an 18-month period postassessment across the state of Connecticut involving heterosexual partners (N = 2,155). Though not definitive, the findings showed persistent gender asymmetry on these behavioral characteristics across arrest categories.

Factors Influencing Resource Use by African American and African Caribbean Women Disclosing Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Lucea, Marguerite B1; Stockman, Jamila K; Mana-Ay, Margarita; Bertrand, Desiree; Callwood, Gloria B; Coverston, Catherine R; Campbell, Doris W; Campbell, Jacquelyn C1 Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, Baltimore, MD, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438557364?accountid=14925

Abstract: Many victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) do not access services. Education and severity of physical violence have previously been shown to predict resource utilization, but whether these hold true specifically among women of African descent is unknown. This article furthers our understanding of the relationship between IPV and resource use, considering sociodemographics and aspects of IPV by presenting results from a study conducted with African American and African Caribbean women in Baltimore, Maryland, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Of the 545 women included in this analysis, 95 (18%) reported emotional abuse only, 274 (50%) reported experiencing physical abuse only, and 176 (32%) had experienced both physical and sexual abuse by an intimate partner. Resource utilization was relatively low among these women, with only 57% seeking any help. Among those who did, 13% sought medical, 18% DV, 37% community, and 41% criminal justice resources. Generalized linear model results indicated that older age and severe risk for lethality from IPV and PTSD were predictive of certain types of resource use, while education, insurance status, and depression had no influence. Perceived availability of police and shelter resources varied by site. Results suggest that systems that facilitate resource redress for all abused women are essential, particularly attending to younger clients who are less likely to seek help, while building awareness that women accessing resources may be at severe risk for lethality from the violence and may also be experiencing mental health complications. In addition, greater efforts should be made on the community level to raise awareness among women of available resources. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Removing Guns From Batterers: Findings From a Pilot Survey of Domestic Violence Restraining Order Recipients in California

Author: Vittes, Katherine A1; Webster, Daniel W; Frattaroli, Shannon; Claire, Barbara E; Wintemute, Garen J1 Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463026574?accountid=14925

Abstract: Persons under certain domestic violence restraining orders in California are required to surrender any firearms in their possession within 24 hours of service. The California Department of Justice funded a pilot program in which Sheriff's Offices in two counties developed a system for better enforcing the firearm surrender requirement. As part of a larger process evaluation, 17 restraining order recipients were interviewed about their experiences with and feelings about the removal of firearms from their abusers. Most women surveyed wanted firearms removed and felt safer as a result of their removal. Implications of the findings are discussed.

When Does Intimate Partner Violence Continue After Separation?

Author: Ornstein, Petra1; Rickne, Johanna1 Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden, Stockholm University, Sweden

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463684806?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over their lifetime, approximately 10% of all women become victims of postseparation stalking or assault. We use a nationally representative survey of separated Swedish women to examine whether men who strive to control their partners during their relationships are more likely to stalk or assault their ex-partners after separation. The empirical analysis shows that basic measures of control behaviors explain 18% of the variance in stalking victimization and 8% of the assault victimization. Moreover, the predictive values of our measures of control by far surpass those of other common risk markers included in the analysis.

Domestic violence against women and professional intervention in primary healthcare: an etnographic study in Matinhos, Parana State, Brazil

Author: SIGNORELLI, Marcos Claudio; AUAD, Daniela; PEREIRA, Pedro Paulo Gomes

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1629331267?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence has multiple repercussions on women's health and raises a challenging agenda for health professionals in Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). The aim of this study was to analyze how health professionals treat these women, problematizing the notion of acolhimento (receptiveness or openness to patients). A qualitative ethnographic research approach was used with health professionals from a primary care unit (PHU) in Matinhos, Parana State, Brazil. The study revealed care that was focused on: (1) biologizing principles, with a focus on physical lesions and medicalization and (2) dialogue, active listening, psychosocial questions, and establishment of ties, especially featuring community health agents in this approach. The limited official local structure for handling domestic violence justifies treatment oriented by the grammar of acolhimento, recommended by the SUS, described in the literature, and verbalized in the PHU, but rarely problematized.

Experiences and acceptance of intimate partner violence: associations with sexually transmitted infection symptoms and ability to negotiate sexual safety among young Liberian women

Author: Callands, Tamora A1; Sipsma, Heather L; Betancourt, Theresa S; Hansen, Nathan B1 Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, USA

Abstract: Women who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) may be at elevated risk for poor sexual health outcomes, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This association, however, has not been consistently demonstrated in low-income or post-conflict countries. Furthermore, the role that attitudes towards IPV play in sexual-health outcomes and behaviour has rarely been examined. We examined associations between IPV experiences, accepting attitudes towards physical IPV, and sexual-health and behavioural outcomes among 592 young women in post-conflict Liberia. Participants' experiences with either moderate or severe physical violence or sexual violence were common. Additionally, accepting attitudes towards physical IPV were positively associated with reporting STI symptoms, IPV experiences and the ability to negotiate safe sex. Findings suggest that for sexual-health-promotion and risk-reduction-intervention efforts to achieve full impact, interventions must address the contextual influence of violence, including individual attitudes toward IPV.

Intimate Partner Violence in Late Life: An Analysis of National News Reports

Author: Roberto, Karen A1; McCann, Brandy Renee; Brossoie, Nancy1 Center for Gerontology, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA kroberto@vt.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494749020?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) in late life takes various forms including physical harm, sexual assault, and murder. Using national newspaper reports of IPV among elders, we identified the types of violence reported most frequently in media and examined how the abuse was conceptualized by reporters. We found that most cases of IPV reported involved murder, with men as perpetrators and women as victims. Caregiving stress and health problems were frequently cited as contributing factors in the cases. Interpreting these findings from a feminist perspective, we suggest implications for practitioners working with older adults. Adapted from the source document.

Family Violence and Aggression and Their Associations With Psychosocial Functioning in Jamaican Adolescents

Author: Smith, Delores E1; Moore, Todd M1 University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429637800?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationships among selected family interaction variables and psychosocial outcomes in a sample of Jamaican adolescents. The authors hypothesized that adolescent psychosocial outcomes would be negatively associated with physical violence, verbal aggression would be more potent than physical violence, and the combined effect of all aggression and violence would be more detrimental than either form of aggression by itself. Overall, the results supported the authors' hypotheses about the detrimental effects of negative family interactions on children's well-being. All the parent-child and interadult variables were positively associated with problematic adolescents' adjustment. However, the verbal aggression variables indicated a greater adverse effect than the physical violence variables. Additionally, the combined effect of parent-child and interadult aggression and violence indicated greater detriment to adjustment than each factor by itself. Interpretation of the findings within the Jamaican context and direction for future research are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Factors associated with child custody evaluators' recommendations in cases of intimate partner violence

Author: Saunders, Daniel G1; Tolman, Richard M; Faller, Kathleen C1 School of Social Work, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, US

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417522353?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although child custody evaluations can lead to unsafe outcomes in cases of intimate partner violence (IPV), little is known about factors associated with evaluators' recommendations. In this study of 465 child custody evaluators, we investigated the association between evaluators' beliefs, background, and knowledge and their custody and visitation recommendations in cases involving IPV. We hypothesized that evaluators' belief in false allegations by the mother and their recommendations that perpetrators have custody or unsupervised visits would be positively associated with (a) being a male evaluator, (b) patriarchal norms, (c) not knowing a survivor of IPV, and (d) less knowledge of IPV. In addition, we hypothesized that evaluators' belief in false allegations by mothers would be related to their recommendation that perpetrators have custody or unsupervised visits. Results supported most of the hypothesized relationships. Multivariate analysis revealed that belief variables explained more of the variance in custody-visitation outcomes than demographic and knowledge variables. Implications of the findings for IPV training, evaluator selection, and evaluation guidelines are provided. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

An Ecological Examination of Factors Influencing Men's Engagement in Intimate Partner Violence Groups

Author: Roy, Valerie1; Chateauvert, Joanie; Richard, Marie-Claude1 Laval University, Quebec city, QC, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463639940?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the findings of an ecological analysis of the factors influencing men's engagement in intimate partner violence (IPV) groups. Individual interviews and two focus groups were conducted with men who participated in group programs in two agencies in Canada. Our qualitative analysis of interviews and focus groups suggested that both individual and program-related factors were determinants in the men's engagement. These findings drew our attention to the influence of certain factors outside of the group therapy, in particular organizational practices. Implications for practice are explored, in particular the role of time in the intervention, and implications for research and limitations are discussed.

Domestic Violence and the Place of Fear in Mother/Baby Relationships: "What Was I Afraid Of? Of Making It Worse."

Author: Buchanan, Fiona1; Power, Charmaine; Verity, Fiona1 University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438557493?accountid=14925

Abstract: It should come as no surprise that when women who have raised babies in domestic violence come together to discuss the formation of relationships with their babies they raise issues of fear. Yet in current attachment studies about the formation of relationships between women and their babies, knowledge of fear based in lived experiences is undervalued. This article draws on a qualitative study of such experiences to explore ways in which fear impacted on 16 women and their babies. From this study it is discerned that fear impacts in diverse ways on women, babies, and their relationships with each other. Women's experiences show that fear is a complex emotion that cannot be understood outside of context, relations, and subjectivity. Furthermore, fear can be the motivation for protection, whereby actions by women are in the interests of safety of their babies. These insights look beyond attachment theory to the manifestations of and responses to fear identified by women who have raised babies while enduring domestic violence.

Intimate Partner Violence in Rwanda: The Mental Health of Victims and Perpetrators

Author: Verduin, Femke1; Engelhard, Esther AN; Rutayisire, Theoneste; Stronks, Karien; Scholte, Willem F1 University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Equator Foundation, International Programmes, Diemen, the Netherlands

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463663881?accountid=14925

Abstract: Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) is a common feature of women living in low- and middle-income countries. Several studies have shown a significant association between IPV against women and mental health in both developed and in low- and middle-income countries. In postconflict settings, the relationship between IPV and mental health is likely more complex, given the high levels of violence experienced by the population as a whole. In this cross-sectional study the authors explore the association between IPV and common mental health disorders (CMD), and more specifically, suicidal ideation, among inhabitants of postgenocide Rwanda. The authors use the concept of "mutual partner violence," thereby exploring the association between IPV and CMD in victims, perpetrators, and those who state they are both. Data of 241 married men and women were used. Symptoms suggestive of CMD were established by use of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), and physical intimate partner violence was measured using the Conflict Tactics Scale, Short Version (CTS2S). The authors applied multivariate logistic regressions with total SRQ-20 scores (above/below cutoff) and suicidal ideation as the outcome measures and corrected for age and gender. The study findings suggest that reported IPV is associated with CMD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.92-3.15) and suicidal ideation (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.70-3.53). Those who state to be both victim and perpetrator (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 0.82-3.72), or only perpetrator (OR = 3.13, 95% CI = 0.49-20.0), are more likely to report mental health problems than victims and people who do not report IPV. In a postconflict situation, perpetrators of IPV may suffer from mental health problems as much as, or even more than, victims. Longitudinal data are needed to clarify the complex relationship between CMD and IPV, especially if outcomes may also be related to other forms of violence experienced in the past.

Author: Slabbert, Ilze1; Green, Sulina1 Department of Social Work, University of Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, South Africa

Abstract: Domestic violence in abuse relationships is a serious challenge encountered by social workers. In this paper, the different types of domestic violence women in abusive relationships might experience are explored. A qualitative study with a phenomenological approach was proposed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of twenty abused women. The results of the study show that participants were exposed to all types of domestic violence. Implications of the findings for case work, group work and community work intervention which social workers should take into account for intervention are highlighted. Adapted from the source document.

NIJ's Program of Domestic Violence Research: Collaborative Efforts to Build Knowledge Guided by Safety For Victims and Accountability of Perpetrators

Author: Auchter, Bernard1; Backes, Bethany L1 National Institute of Justice (Retired), Bethesda, MD, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299370?accountid=14925

Abstract: The primary focus of the National Institute of Justice's (NIJ's) Violence Against Women (VAW) research and evaluation program has been domestic violence, also called intimate partner violence (IPV). The program has supported over 200 studies that have centered on definition and measurement, victims and perpetrators, children, contexts and consequences of domestic violence, and civil and criminal justice interventions and processes responding to these crimes. Funding approaches in the program have employed grants for research and evaluation, demonstration programs with partner agencies, joint funding of research through interagency agreements, and collaborations with agencies and organizations sharing common objectives. Results have influenced policy and practices, particularly results from those studies conducted by researcher-practitioner collaborations. NIJ's success in the development and progress of this program is attributed to the initial vision that included researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in an ongoing discourse about what is known and needs to be known. The terms domestic violence and IPV are used interchangeably throughout the article. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Teen Dating Violence: Building a Research Program Through Collaborative Insights

Author: Mulford, Carrie F1; Blachman-Demner, Dara R1 National Institute of Justice, Washington, DC, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494298427?accountid=14925

Abstract: The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) has an emerging portfolio of research in the area of teen dating violence (also known as adolescent relationship abuse). This article begins with a discussion of the developments that prompted NIJ to focus on teen dating violence. Next, the article highlights specific accomplishments and contributions that NIJ has made to helping develop knowledge and scientific understanding of adolescent relationship abuse, particularly around the prevention of teen dating violence perpetration and victimization. This is followed by a presentation of some of the key findings from NIJ-funded research. We then move to a discussion of some of the complex issues around definition, measurement and research methods and how NIJ has been involved in addressing those issues. The article concludes with some thoughts about the intersection of teen dating violence research, policy, and practice and highlights several research gaps that are in need of additional attention.

Health Indicators, Social Support, and Intimate Partner Violence Among Women Utilizing Services at a Community Organization

Author: Kamimura, Akiko; Parekh, Asha; Olson, Lenora M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1373428773?accountid=14925

Abstract: Purpose: Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women is a significant public health concern. This study examines the physical and mental health status and relationship to social support for women seeking services to end IPV at a walk-in community organization that serves the community at large, including a shelter for abused women. Methods: One hundred seventeen (117) English-speaking women between the ages of 18 and 61 years participated in a self-administered survey. Physical, mental, and oral health, social support, and IPV homicide lethality were measured using standardized instruments. Results: Social support was the most important factor related to better health. The participants who had more social support reported better physical (p<.05), mental (p<.01), and oral health (p<.05), and a lower level of psychological distress (p<.01) and depression (p<.01) compared with participants who reported less social support. The participants living in the shelter reported worse physical health (p<.05) but better mental health (p<.05) than the participants not living in a shelter. Older age and low income were related to oral health problems, whereas older age, low education level, and unemployment were related to poor mental health. Conclusions: The present study adds to the evidence that social support contributes to improving physical and mental health for women who experience IPV. The findings also suggest the importance of providing or referring women to mental health services. [Copyright Jacobs Institute of Women's Health; published by Elsevier Science Inc.]

The role of the State in protecting women against domestic violence and women's shelters in Turkey

Author: Sallan Guel, Songuel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438555070?accountid=14925

Abstract: Poverty and violence patterns function in an intertwined way for poor women. Because of patriarchal and conservative structure of welfare state in many countries, women's, especially poor women's, dependency on men becomes life-long due to their care taking responsibilities, lack of regular income, adequate education and work skills, decent work opportunities, health insurance and social security. Thus, women often do not have a say in determining their own lives. Such a dependency is itself a major contributing factor in male violence against women. Besides, efforts to increase female employment do not seem to have alleviated neither women's poverty nor domestic violence mainly due to poor conditions in the labour market. This study in general aims to discuss the issues of the welfare, employment and dependency of women and the condition of battered women with regard to gender and family in the welfare state. For this purpose, first, in the process of fight with domestic violence, the obligations of the state arising from the international treaties on women's rights and the prevention of violence against women and the influence of the national and international women's movement in this process are reviewed and analyzed. Second, the role and impact of the patriarchal family structure are questioned in the process of welfare regime transformation in Turkey. Third, the problem of domestic violence as public matter rather than a sole private nuisance, increased state involvement in preventing violence against women and the impact of EU negotiations and women's movement on this process are evaluated. Finally, the study examines the role of women's shelters in the struggle against violence and their contribution to women's welfare and wellbeing during and after their stay in the shelters in the light of the findings of a field study carried out with the battered women living in women's shelters in Turkey.

Child Protection Intervention in Domestic Violence: An Illustrative Case Narrative

Author: Emerson, Darcie1; Magnuson, Doug1 School of Child & Youth Care, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504423278?accountid=14925

Abstract: This is a case study, written from the point of view of child protection caseworkers, about their work with one family. They draw on practices originating in solution-focused and brief therapy, response-based theory, and relationship-based practice. The goal is to implement practices that (a) hold the perpetrator accountable rather than the victim, (b) attempt to avoid putting the mother in a position of having to choose between partner and children, (c) capitalize on child protection's unusual mandate in order to provide support for the mother, and (d) position the professional as a supportive ally of the mother and children instead of relying on the investigative stance. The case is an instance of how these goals and principles are operationalized. Examples of their choices include holding the perpetrator accountable instead of the mother, (a) focusing on what the mother is already doing to protect the children rather than what she is not doing, (b) placing the Ministry of Children and Family Development between the perpetrator and the victim, (c) avoiding forcing the mother to choose between her children and her partner, and (d) attending to the qualities of the relationship with the mother. Adapted from the source document.

Meaning-Making and Domestic Violence Victim Advocacy: An Examination of Feminist Identities, Ideologies, and Practices

Author: Nichols, Andrea J11 Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541997637?accountid=14925

Abstract: Early domestic violence victim advocacy included survivor-defined, intersectional, and social change practices rooted in feminism. Yet, research specifically examining the ways that advocates identify with and make meaning of feminism, and the relationship of such meanings to advocates' practices, is limited. Drawing from interviews with 26 domestic violence victim advocates, the interaction between feminist identity, ideology, and practices is examined. Findings indicated that advocates with feminist identities and ideologies held survivor-defined, social change, and intersectional approaches to advocacy. Nonfeminist advocates practiced survivor-defined advocacy, but did not maintain social change or intersectional practices. Implications for advocacy are provided.

Abstract: Purpose: To test a theater intervention designed to raise awareness of the dynamics and consequences of teen dating violence (TDV) and to facilitate creation of nonviolent responses to TDV among Latino and Latina adolescents. The intervention was based on Theater of the Oppressed, which advocates the use of theater methods to explore social issues and to allow audiences to experiment with problem-solving, thereby promoting change. Methods: This study used a pretest-posttest, no control group, mixed-measures design to study 66 Mexican-American adolescents (mean age, 13.4 +/- 5 years). Two plays containing subtle and overt signs of control and abuse were written and performed. Scripts were based on data from prior studies of TDV among Latino and Latina adolescents. At baseline, we measured sociodemographics, personal safety, and ethnic identity. Pre-post instruments measured acceptance of TDV, confidence to resolve conflicts nonviolently, and intentions to use nonviolent strategies to resolve conflict. We collected qualitative data via essay. Results: At posttest, participants had less acceptance of TDV (t=-2.08; p < .05), increased confidence to resolve conflicts nonviolently (t= 3.82; p < .001), and higher intentions to use nonviolent strategies (t= 3.35; p= .001). We analyzed 20 essays. Qualitative results provided context for understanding participants' changes in attitude, confidence, and nonviolent behavioral intentions. Conclusions: This adaptation of Theater of the Oppressed was an effective way to interact with Latino adolescents. In a safe setting, participants vicariously experienced TDV, which facilitated self-reflection and cognitive rehearsal strategies to respond nonviolently to TDV.

Abstract: Psychological maltreatment (PM) is an extremely heterogeneous phenomenon that includes several subtypes. The aim of this work is to explore whether the accumulation of different subtypes of PM has a greater impact on the child's psychopathology and functional impairment. One hundred and sixty-eight children and adolescents aged between 4 and 17 whose mothers had been exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) participated. Psychopathology was assessed through a rating scale and a diagnostic interview. Polynomial contrasts by means of Generalized Estimated Equations explored linear and quadratic trends. The greater the number of PM subtypes suffered by children, the greater the adverse effects in psychopathology and functioning. When a child suffers four PM subtypes, the number of DSM disorders is, on average, twice as high compared with children who are suffering only one PM subtype. Linear trends were mainly found in internalizing problems. The importance of accurately assessing characteristics and severity of PM, and design efficient programs of prevention and treatment, is highlighted. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Child Adjustment: Moderation by Father Contact?

Author: Hunter, Erin C1; Graham-Bermann, Sandra A1 Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, 530 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-1043, USA echunter@umich.edu

Abstract: Little is currently known about father-child contact in families with histories of intimate partner violence (IPV), despite important implications of father contact for these families. The current study of 219 ethnically diverse children aged 6 to 12-years-old and their abused mothers examined relations between father contact, IPV, and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Approximately 30 % of the children had no current in-person contact with their father, while another 15 % saw their father every day of the past year. Child internalizing and externalizing problems were positively correlated with frequency of IPV, but unrelated to father contact. Controlling for marital status and mother education, father contact moderated relations between IPV and child externalizing, but not internalizing problems. While father contact was not associated with child adjustment across the entire sample, it did moderate relations between IPV and child behavior problems, suggesting that child contact with a less violent or nonviolent father or father figure might have a buffering effect on behavior problems in children exposed to IPV. Recommendations around father contact in families with IPV are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Does Training and Documentation Improve Emergency Department Assessments of Domestic Violence Victims?

Author: Ritchie, Miranda1; Nelson, Katherine; Wills, Russell; Jones, Lisa1 Health Networks Limited, PO Box 8363, Havelock North, 4157, New Zealand

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667951548?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study aimed to determine whether training and documentation led to improved assessment of female victims of assault due to domestic violence presenting to an emergency department. Eighty clinical records were audited using a valid and reliable audit tool over four time periods for variables including history, risk assessment, and examination. Documentation differed across the four groups (p=0.011). Between group analysis found there was a difference (p=0.055) between Groups 1 (before training) and 2 (after training), and Group 3 (with a specialist form in place), and there was a difference (p=0.009) between Groups 1 and 4 (8 years later). Training alone did not lead to change. Introducing specialist documentation with training was associated with an improvement in the standard of clinical assessment of female victims of assault due to domestic violence and this change increased over time.

Reactions to Dating Violence Research: Do Difficulties with Distress Tolerance Increase Negative Reactions?

Author: Shorey, Ryan C1; Febres, Jeniimarie; Brasfield, Hope; Zucosky, Heather; Cornelius, Tara L; Stuart, Gregory L1 Department of Psychology, University of Tennessee, 1404 Circle Dr., Austin Peay Building, 311, Knoxville, TN, 37996, USA rshorey@utk.edu

Abstract: Recent research has begun to examine whether participants in dating violence studies perceive any benefit from the research and/or experience emotional distress as a result of having participated. Such information is important for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and researchers in determining ethical and appropriate protections for participants. In the current study, we examined participants' reactions to answering questions on dating violence victimization and perpetration utilizing a sample of female college students (N=282). We also examined whether distress tolerance was associated with research reactions and moderated the relation between reports of victimization/perpetration and negative emotional reactions to the research. Findings demonstrated that negative emotional reactions to the research did not differ between individuals with or without previous dating violence. Further, distress tolerance had a main effect, but not a moderating effect, on negative emotional reactions to research participation. Implications of these findings for future research and IRBs are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Criminal Case Outcomes, Incarceration, and Subsequent Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Bell, Margret E1; Cattaneo, Lauren Bennett; Goodman, Lisa A; Dutton, Mary Ann1 Veterans Affairs (VA) Boston Healthcare System and Boston University, Boston, MA, USA mebell@aya.yale.edu

Abstract: Given the centrality of court interventions to the U.S. response to intimate partner violence (IPV), it is crucial to evaluate their impact on reabuse. To do so, this study examined whether female IPV victims' experiences of abuse in the year following a criminal court case against their partner varied by case outcome or by whether the batterer had or had not been incarcerated. Consistent with prior research, we found no main effect differences in reabuse trajectories by court case outcome or by incarceration. We also examined variables that might moderate the impact of case outcome and incarceration on reabuse and found that although batterer legal history did not affect the impact of case outcome, his age, Time 1 employment status, the couple's Time 1 living arrangement, and duration of abuse did interact with case outcome. No variables tested moderated the relationship between incarceration and reabuse over time. Findings suggest that in certain cases there may be benefits to case outcomes that leave potential consequences hanging over the offender's head. These results also add to the growing body of evidence questioning the efficacy of one-size-fits-all approaches to IPV cases. Adapted from the source document.

"Sometimes You Just Have to Have a Lot of Bitter to Make It Sweet": Substance Abuse and Partner Abuse in the Lives of HIV-Positive Men Who Have Sex with Men

Author: Andrasik, Michele P1; Valentine, Sarah E; Pantalone, David W1 University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington mandrasik@fhcrc.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299541?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although links between partner abuse (PA) and substance abuse (SA) are well-documented in the literature, we know less about these relations among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted a qualitative study with this group (N = 28). Participants reported (1) social modeling of SA in childhood and in adult social networks, (2) initial use of substance to cope with child abuse and neglect, and (3) the reinforcement of problematic SA by experiences of PA, whereby SA led to PA, resulting in increased SA. Recommendations for clinicians working with HIV-positive MSM are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Pathways Into and Out of Homelessness: Domestic Violence and Housing Security for Immigrant Women

Author: Thurston, Wilfreda E1; Roy, Amrita; Clow, Barbara; Este, David; Gordey, Tess; Haworth-Brockman, Margaret; McCoy, Liza; Beck, Rachel Rapaport; Saulnier, Christine; Carruthers, Lesley1 Department of Community Health Sciences and Department of Ecosystem and Public Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada thurston@ucalgary.ca

Abstract: Housing insecurity is a major barrier to leaving domestic violence; it may force abused women to live in inadequate conditions or to return to their abusers. Immigrant women face additional barriers. Longitudinal interviews with 37 abused immigrant women living in three Canadian cities investigated key causes of housing insecurity. Results show a need to target systemic factors, a diversity of issues foregrounded along pathways into and out of homelessness, and complex indicators of risk. Advocacy is key to exiting abuse and obtaining secure housing, and cultural competency in services is needed to adequately support immigrant women experiencing domestic violence.

What's Age Got to Do With It? Partner Age Difference, Power, Intimate Partner Violence, and Sexual Risk in Urban Adolescents

Abstract: Adolescent girls with older male main partners are at greater risk for adverse sexual health outcomes than other adolescent girls. One explanation for this finding is that low relationship power occurs with partner age difference. Using a cross-sectional, descriptive design, we investigated the effect of partner age difference between an adolescent girl and her male partner on sexual risk behavior through the mediators of sexual relationship power, and physical intimate partner violence (IPV), and psychological IPV severity. We chose Blanc's framework to guide this study as it depicts the links among demographic, social, economic, relationship, family and community characteristics, and reproductive health outcomes with gender-based relationship power and violence. Urban adolescent girls (N = 155) completed an anonymous computer-assisted self-interview survey to examine partner and relationship factors' effect on consistent condom use. Our sample had an average age of 16.1 years with a mean partner age of 17.8 years. Partners were predominantly African American (75%), non-Hispanic (74%), and low-income (81%); 24% of participants reported consistent condom use in the last 3 months. Descriptive, correlation, and multiple mediation analyses were conducted. Partner age difference was negatively associated with consistent condom use (-.4292, p < .01); however, the indirect effects through three proposed mediators (relationship power, physical IPV, or psychological IPV severity) were not statistically significant. Further studies are needed to explore alternative rationale explaining the relationship between partner age differences and sexual risk factors within adolescent sexual relationships. Nonetheless, for clinicians and researchers, these findings underscore the heightened risk associated with partner age differences and impact of relationship dynamics on sexual risk behavior.

Intimate Partner Violence and Depressive Symptoms Before Pregnancy, During Pregnancy, and After Infant Delivery: An Exploratory Study

Abstract: Women who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy also tend to experience depressive symptoms. Unfortunately, little is known about how victimized women's levels of depressive symptoms change longitudinally before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and after infant delivery. In addition, few studies have used a comparison group of women to determine if levels of depressive symptoms among victimized women differ from depressive symptom levels in women who have not experienced IPV. To help address these knowledge gaps, we examined longitudinal trends in levels of depressive symptoms among a sample of 76 women who did (n = 33) and did not (n = 43) experience physical IPV during pregnancy. Using multilevel analysis, we estimated the relationship of physical IPV victimization and women's depressive symptom levels across six time periods: (a) the year before pregnancy, (b) first and second trimesters, (c) third trimester, (d) the first month postpartum, (e) Months 2 to 6 postpartum, and (f) Months 7 to 12 postpartum. Women who experienced physical IPV victimization during pregnancy had significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms during each time period (p < .05). No significant difference between the two groups was found in the rate of change in levels of depressive symptoms over time. These findings point to the importance of screening for IPV within health care settings and suggest that women physically abused during pregnancy need safety interventions that are coordinated with interventions targeting symptoms of depression.

Troubled Times, Troubled Relationships: How Economic Resources, Gender Beliefs, and Neighborhood Disadvantage Influence Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Golden, Shelley D1; Perreira, Krista M; Durrance, Christine Piette1 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438556183?accountid=14925

Abstract: We evaluate race/ethnicity and nativity-based disparities in three different types of intimate partner violence (IPV) and examine how economic hardship, maternal economic dependency, maternal gender beliefs, and neighborhood disadvantage influence these disparities. Using nationally representative data from urban mothers of young children who are living with their intimate partners (N = 1,886), we estimate a series of unadjusted and adjusted logit models on mothers' reports of physical assault, emotional abuse, and coercion. When their children were age 3, more than one in five mothers were living with a partner who abused them. The prevalence of any IPV was highest among Hispanic (26%) and foreign-born (35%) mothers. Economic hardship, economic dependency on a romantic partner, and traditional gender beliefs each increased women's risk for exposure to one or more types of IPV, whereas neighborhood conditions were not significantly related to IPV in adjusted models. These factors also explained most of the racial/ethnic and nativity disparities in IPV. Policies and programs that reduce economic hardship among women with young children, promote women's economic independence, and foster gender equity in romantic partnerships can potentially reduce multiple forms of IPV.

Intimate Partner Violence, Depressive Symptoms, and Immigration Status: Does Existing Advocacy Intervention Work on Abused Immigrant Women in the Chinese Community?

Author: Wong, Janet Y H1; Tiwari, Agnes; Fong, Daniel Y T; Yuen, K H; Humphreys, Janice; Bullock, Linda1 The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong S.A.R., China

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554136?accountid=14925

Abstract: Advocacy intervention has been shown to be efficacious at reducing depressive symptoms in women who suffer from intimate partner violence (IPV). However, the intervention effect among abused immigrant women has not been well studied. This study compares the demographic and psychosocial characteristics between abused immigrant and nonimmigrant women, and evaluates the impact of immigration status on the efficacy of an advocacy intervention in reducing depressive symptoms and improving perceived social support. Two hundred abused Chinese women recruited from a local community center in Hong Kong were randomized to receive either the advocacy intervention or usual care. The advocacy intervention was found to be effective at reducing depressive symptoms and improving social support for abused Chinese nonimmigrant women, but the same effects were not seen for abused immigrant women. The findings provide essential insights into the need for developing targeted and efficacious advocacy interventions for abused immigrant women. Effective services to address abused immigrant women's needs were also suggested. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Parenting of Men With Co-Occurring Intimate Partner Violence and Substance Abuse

Author: Stover, Carla Smith1; Easton, Caroline J; McMahon, Thomas J1 Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463380210?accountid=14925

Abstract: No studies to date have compared parenting behaviors of men with co-occurring intimate partner violence (IPV) and substance abuse (SA) with community controls. This study was designed to document mediators of differences in parenting behavior of fathers and the emotional-behavioral problems of their children for men with co-occurring SA and IPV. The self-reported parenting (negative, positive and coparenting behaviors) and the child emotional-behavioral problems of 43 fathers with children aged 2 to 6 years with a recent history of SA + IPV were compared to a sample of 43 community control fathers with the same socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Fathers completed measures on their parenting behavior with a target child, coparenting behavior with the child's mother, emotion regulation, romantic attachment, psychiatric symptoms, and the behavior of the target child. Men with co-occurring SA + IPV had significantly less positive coparenting and more negative parenting behaviors than community control fathers. Negative parenting and coparenting were mediated by the fathers' avoidant attachment problems. SA + IPV fathers also reported more emotional and behavioral problems in their children. These poor child outcome differences between groups were mediated by the negative parenting behaviors of the fathers. These results suggest areas of potential focus in interventions with fathers who have co-occurring SA + IPV issues. Focus on attachment difficulties with his coparent, which may include affect regulation, coping with emotions, and communication skills training related to coparenting, may yield significant changes in parenting behaviors and ultimately child functioning.

Wounded Healers: Graduate Students with Histories of Trauma in a Family Violence Course

Author: Zosky, Diane L11 School of Social Work, Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois, USA dlzosky@ilstu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1567043181?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work students are witness to a variety of challenges from course content through scenarios, videos, role-plays, and field practice. Students may be vulnerable to experiencing vicarious traumatization from this exposure. Some students, however, may have personal histories of trauma and may therefore experience posttraumatic stress reactions due to triggering of past trauma through course content. This case study examines feedback from three graduate students from a family violence class who self-identified that they had personal histories of trauma from family violence. Their feedback can be beneficial to instructors in managing students' reactions that might be triggered from course content. Adapted from the source document.

The Rate of Cyber Dating Abuse Among Teens and How It Relates to Other Forms of Teen Dating Violence

Author: Zweig, Janine M1; Dank, Meredith; Yahner, Jennifer; Lachman, Pamela1 Urban Institute, Justice Policy Center, Washington, DC, USA jzweig@urban.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429629701?accountid=14925

Abstract: To date, little research has documented how teens might misuse technology to harass, control, and abuse their dating partners. This study examined the extent of cyber dating abuse-abuse via technology and new media-in youth relationships and how it relates to other forms of teen dating violence. A total of 5,647 youth from ten schools in three northeastern states participated in the survey, of which 3,745 reported currently being in a dating relationship or having been in one during the prior year (52 % were female; 74 % White). Just over a quarter of youth in a current or recent relationship said that they experienced some form of cyber dating abuse victimization in the prior year, with females reporting more cyber dating abuse victimization than males (particularly sexual cyber dating abuse). One out of ten youth said that they had perpetrated cyber dating abuse, with females reporting greater levels of non-sexual cyber dating abuse perpetration than males; by contrast, male youth were significantly more likely to report perpetrating sexual cyber dating abuse. Victims of sexual cyber dating abuse were seven times more likely to have also experienced sexual coercion (55 vs. 8 %) than were non-victims, and perpetrators of sexual cyber dating abuse were 17 times more likely to have also perpetrated sexual coercion (34 vs. 2 %) than were non-perpetrators. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

'Making Safe': A Coordinated Community Response to Empowering Victims and Tackling Perpetrators of Domestic Violence

Author: Clarke, Alan1; Wydall, Sarah1 Department of Law and Criminology, Aberystwyth University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429636541?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes an exploratory study of the Making Safe Scheme, which is a multi-agency initiative designed to provide a coordinated and integrated response to domestic violence by focusing on both victims and perpetrators. A key feature of the intervention is that it enables victims to remain in their own homes, provided it is considered safe to do so, and re-houses perpetrators. Consequently, the wrong-doer leaves the home and practitioners can work with families in their established communities to prevent further abuse. In 2008, the project was awarded the Butler Trust Public Protection Award for its innovative work with victims and offenders. The findings from this study focus on a number of themes: perpetrator accountability, the changing balance of power in abusive relationships and the increased opportunities for victims and their families to engage in recovery work whilst remaining in the family home.

Changed and Changing Gender and Family Roles and Domestic Violence in African Refugee Background Communities Post-Settlement in Perth, Australia

Author: Fisher, Colleen11 The University of Western Australia, Crawley, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494300478?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this study, domestic violence (DV) in five African refugee background communities post-settlement in Perth, Australia, is investigated-specifically, the interrelationship between experiences of DV, and changed and changing gender and family roles and responsibilities. The participatory qualitative design utilized in-depth interviews with 54 members of the Somalian, Sierra Leonean, Ethiopian, Liberian and Sudanese Communities, and focus groups with 24 professionals who support them. Three key dimensions of this interrelationship are discussed: "male loss of the breadwinner role and status," "financial independence," and "mismatch between formal response and expectations." The importance of understanding experiences of DV within the context of cultural transition is highlighted here. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Expanding Resource Theory and Feminist-Informed Theory to Explain Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration by Court-Ordered Men

Author: Basile, Kathleen C1; Hall, Jeffrey E; Walters, Mikel L1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299133?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study tested resource and feminist-informed theories to explain physical, sexual, psychological, and stalking intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrated by court-mandated men. Data were obtained from 340 men arrested for physical assault of a partner before their court-ordered treatment. Using path analysis, findings provided partial support for each model. Ineffective arguing and substance-use problems were moderators of resources and perpetration. Dominance mediated early exposures and perpetration in the feminist-informed model. In both models, predictors of stalking were different than those for other types of perpetration. Future studies should replicate this research and determine the utility of combining models.

Domestic Violence in a Developing Context: The Perspectives of Women in Northern Ethiopia

Author: Allen, Mary1; Raghallaigh, Muireann Ni1 School of Applied Social Science, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, Sadly, Dr. Allen died in June 2013 prior to the publication of this article

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299392?accountid=14925

Abstract: The World Health Organization's multicountry study of the prevalence rates of intimate partner violence found extremely high rates of violence against women in Ethiopia. This article seeks to enhance our understanding of this violence. By drawing on focus group research conducted with women in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, it explores the types of domestic violence experienced by these women, the impact of this violence, the reasons for it, and the multiple resistance strategies used by the women. The findings suggest a potentially important role for professional social work practice in the Ethiopian context. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Battery and Development: Exploring the link between Intimate Partner Violence and Modernization

Author: Martinez, Pilar Rodriguez1; Khalil, Huzefa1 Universidad de Almeria, La Canada de S. Urbano, s/n Almeria, Spain

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448991706?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article focuses on the changes in attitudes about sexuality, gender equality, and intimate partner violence within the context of modernization. Revised modernization theory predicts that increasing development leads to greater levels of egalitarian gender values and liberal sexual mores as part of a larger change in society. Our analysis leads to the conclusion that although both these sets of attitudes are a part of the movement towards postmaterialist values, in the context of intimate partner violence, different dynamics prevail at different levels of development. Using regression analysis and data from the fifth wave of the World Values Survey, we find a significant relationship between attitudes towards intimate partner violence, egalitarian gender values and liberal sexual mores. In general, liberal attitudes towards sexuality do not necessarily mean a lower tolerance for intimate partner violence. Crucially, the relationship between these three sets of values depends on the level of development. We find that in agrarian and industrial societies, higher levels of liberal sexual mores with lower levels of egalitarian gender values lead to a higher level of support for intimate partner violence against women.

Intimate partner violence and sexual health outcomes: a population-based study among 16-44-year-old women in Estonia

Author: Laanpere, Made1; Ringmets, Inge; Part, Kai; Karro, Helle1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia made.laanpere@ut.ee

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448997034?accountid=14925

Abstract: Background: Violence against women as a public issue and health burden has only recently been acknowledged in Estonia. The aim of this study was to outline the prevalence and to explore the associations of intimate partner violence (IPV) and selected sexual health outcomes. Methods: Data from the population based cross-sectional survey among representative sample of 16-44-year-old non-pregnant women (n = 1966) were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Of 1966 respondents, 362 (18.4%) reported IPV during 12 months preceding the survey. Physical IPV was reported by 339 (17.2%), sexual by 80 (4.1%) and both physical and sexual by 35 (1.8%) of respondents. After controlling for significant confounding socio-demographic factors, exposure to IPV was found to be associated with contraception non-use [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-2.82] or the use of unreliable contraceptive methods (AOR = 1.54, CI 1.16-2.04) during the most recent sexual intercourse, having never used a condom (AOR = 1.53, CI 1.12-2.10), repeat induced abortion (AOR = 1.72, CI 1.24-2.37), lifetime sexually transmitted infections (AOR = 2.05, CI 1.56-2.68) and dyspareunia (AOR = 2.14, CI 1.65-2.77). Conclusion: The exposure of IPV was an important contributor to sexual risk behaviour and adverse sexual health outcomes among women of reproductive age in Estonia. Any strategy to promote sexual health should include prevention of IPV and other forms of violence against women with the strengthening of women's sexual and reproductive rights.

Dating Violence Perpetration and Victimization Among U.S. Adolescents: Prevalence, Patterns, and Associations With Health Complaints and Substance Use

Author: Haynie, Denise L; Farhat, Tilda; Brooks-Russell, Ashley; Wang, Jing; Barbieri, Brittney; Iannotti, Ronald J

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541998747?accountid=14925

Abstract: Purpose This research identified conceptually cohesive latent classes of youth dating violence (DV) and examined associations between covariates and classes by gender. Methods: A nationally representative sample of 2,203 10th grade students completed assessments of physical and verbal DV victimization and perpetration, depressive symptoms, health complaints, and substance use. A Factor Mixture Model was used to identify patterns of DV. Gender differences among classes were examined for depressive symptoms, health complaints, and substance use. Results: Prevalence of DV victimization was 35% and perpetration was 31%. A three-class model fit adequately and provided conceptual cohesion: Class 1 = non-involved (65%); Class 2 = victims/perpetrators of verbal DV (30%); and Class 3 = victims/perpetrators of verbal and physical DV (5%). Compared with Class 1 adolescents, those in Classes 2 and 3 were more likely to report depressive symptoms, psychological complaints, and alcohol use. Females in Classes 2 and 3 were also more likely to report physical complaints, cigarette use, and marijuana use. Among females involved in DV, those in Class 3 compared with Class 2 reported more depressive symptoms, physical and psychological complaints, and cigarette and marijuana use. Conclusions: The three-class model distinguished involvement in verbal acts from involvement in verbal and physical acts. Adolescents involved in DV had similar probabilities of reporting perpetration and victimization, suggesting violence within relationships may be mutual. Involvement in DV was associated with more health issues and concurrent problem behaviors. For females in particular, the increased involvement in DV was associated with other health indicators.

Preliminary examination of a mutual intimate partner violence intervention among treatment-mandated couples

Author: Wray, Alisha M; Hoyt, Tim; Gerstle, Melissa

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a widespread global health problem. Despite growing evidence indicating that men and women commit IPV, most traditional interventions focus on male-to-female violence and do not address mutual violence. This circumscribed focus represents one potential reason traditional treatments have had only a modest effect on recidivism. The current study investigated a pilot intervention for mutually violent couples with ethnically diverse, treatment-mandated men and women. Using a longitudinal design, 121 couples were assessed (semistructured clinical interview, Conflict Tactics Scale -- Revised [CTS-2]) and mandated to either the pilot intervention or another community agency. Of the 92 couples referred for the 12-week, pilot group intervention (plus 1-2 preparatory, individual sessions), 89% of couples had one or both partners complete. Posttreatment assessments were conducted (CTS-2, satisfaction ratings), anticipating reductions in perpetrated and received IPV among treatment completers. Using 1-year conviction data to assess recidivism (IPV and general violence convictions), it was hypothesized that the lowest recidivism rates would be found when both partners completed, intermediate rates when one partner completed, and the highest rates when neither completed. Consistent with hypotheses, men who completed treatment reported reduced perpetration of physical assault and received less injury, and women who completed reported receiving less physical assault and injury. At 1-year follow-up, couples who completed had lower recidivism rates, with couples in which both partners completed evidencing the best outcomes. Results provide preliminary support for the proposed mutual violence intervention. Clinical implications, including the effect of a thorough assessment and tailored treatment recommendations, are discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448999200?accountid=14925

Abstract: The study used Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database to investigate the types of injuries suffered by those patients hospitalized for intimate partner violence and the types of hospital care provided to victims 18 years of age or older from 1997 to 2009. In total, there were 836 cases and 3.57 times more female than male, the average hospital stay length was 9.37 days, and the average hospital costs totaled approximately NT$ 47,563.53. On average, there were approximately 2.86 injuries per abuse victim, and intracranial injuries were the most common injury (28.83%). Many of the abused patients went to regional hospitals (44.14%), and the largest percentage of hospitalized patients (50.24%) was among 25-44-year-olds. In the study period, the hospitalization rate for females was significantly higher than for males; moreover, the overall rate of hospitalization for intimate partner violence increased significantly.

Irrational Beliefs About Family Violence: A Pilot Study Within Jordanian University Students

Author: Takash, Hanan1; Ghaith, Souad; Hammouri, Hind1 Department of Special Education, Hashemite University, PO Box 150459, Azzarqa, Jordan, 13115 dr.h.takash@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448997700?accountid=14925

Abstract: This pilot study aimed to explore the irrational beliefs of family violence within Jordanian society. Students in the study included 500 volunteered undergraduate students enrolled in a university requirement course at Hashemite University. A questionnaire was constructed to investigate students' irrational beliefs of family violence. The results of the study indicated high agreement with most of the irrational beliefs about family and psychological violence. Moreover, the results revealed that females were more agreeable on the irrational beliefs of the family violence than males. The results of the study may reflect lack of awareness of family violence and its consequences on the individual emotional and behavioral system. Adapted from the source document.

Dating Violence Among Gay Men in China

Author: Yu, Yong1; Xiao, Shuiyuan; Liu, Kirin Qilin1 College of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China Zhongshan Institute, Zhongshan, Guangdong, P. R. China

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463025781?accountid=14925

Abstract: This is the first study on the prevalence of dating violence and threats of being forced to 'come out of the closet' among Chinese gay men. Data on social demographic information and the experience of dating violence, including types of abuse, threats of 'outing,' and the gender of abusers were collected from 418 gay men and 330 heterosexual men by self-administered questionnaires. Mann-Whitney U test, X2 test, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to test group differences. Up to 32.8% of the gay men had experienced one abuse or more. Among those experiencing abuse, 83.9% of the gay men never told anyone about their abuse. The experience of any form of abuse by gay men was 5.07 times higher than the rate of abuse among heterosexual men controlling for age in logistic regression models. In addition, 12.4% of the gay men have experienced the threat of being outed. Overall, dating violence is more prevalent in gay men than in heterosexuals. Efforts to prevent dating violence, especially among gay men, should be made in China. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Prevalence and Correlates of Intimate Partner Violence by Type and Severity: Population-Based Studies in Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Ukraine

Author: Ismayilova, Leyla1; El-Bassel, Nabila1 School of Social Service Administration, University of Chicago, IL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1464016061?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article estimates the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of intimate partner violence (IPV) by type and severity in population-based samples from three countries of the former Soviet Union (fSU). The article utilized nationally representative data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in Azerbaijan (2006), Moldova (2005), and Ukraine (2007). Respondents were selected using stratified multistage cluster sampling. The sample included ever-married (or cohabitating) females of reproductive age (15-49 years old); weighted sample n = 3,847 in Azerbaijan, n = 4,321 in Moldova, and n = 2,355 in Ukraine. The analysis used multinomial survey logistic regression adjusting for the sampling design and sampling weights. Ten percent of ever-partnered women in Azerbaijan and Ukraine and 20% in Moldova ever experienced physical IPV (without sexual) from their most recent husband or cohabitating partner; 3% of women in Azerbaijan and Ukraine and 5% in Moldova experienced sexual IPV (with or without physical), and 2% of women in Azerbaijan, 3% in Ukraine, and 6% in Moldova experienced violence resulting in severe physical injuries from their most recent partner. In all three countries physical, sexual, and injurious IPV was higher among formerly married women. Compared to women with above secondary education, women with secondary education or below demonstrated higher risk for physical IPV (in Moldova and Ukraine), sexual IPV in Moldova, and injurious IPV in all three countries. Poor socioeconomic status-as indicated by low household wealth status in Azerbaijan and partner's unemployment in Moldova and Ukraine-was significantly associated with higher risk for physical and injurious IPV. In Moldova and Ukraine partners' low level of education was associated with higher risk for sexual IPV. The article demonstrates that experiences and factors associated with IPV are diverse and context specific. The findings may be helpful in targeting interventions to sociodemographic groups disproportionately affected by IPV in these three transitional countries.

Relationship of Intimate Partner Violence to Health Status, Chronic Disease, and Screening Behaviors

Author: Mathew, Anitha1; Smith, L Shakiyla; Marsh, Brittany; Houry, Debra1 Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463014743?accountid=14925

Abstract: While victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) have increased risk of chronic disease, little is known about their preventive screening behaviors. The objective of this study was to relate IPV to health status, chronic disease, and preventive screening behaviors. We hypothesized that women who reported poorer health statuses, higher rates of HIV, no primary care, and less-frequent HIV testing, breast exams, and Pap smears would be more likely to experience IPV. Adult females who presented to three Emergency Departments (EDs) on weekdays from 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. over a 14-month period were asked to participate in a computerized survey. Women were excluded if they were critically ill, did not speak English, intoxicated, or psychotic. Validated measures were used, including the Universal Violence Prevention Screen and the Short Form-12. Patients were asked about their health statuses, HIV statuses, and testing, if they had a regular doctor, and how often they had received pap smears and breast exams. Logistic regression modeling was used to test associations between IPV and the predictor variables, adjusting for age, employment, and education. Out of 3,381 approached, 1,474 women (43.6%) agreed to be surveyed. Age averaged 39 years +/- 12.3 (range = 18-65), and most participants were Black (n = 722, 86.8%). One hundred and fifty-three out of 832 women (18.4%) who had been in a relationship the previous year had experienced IPV. Compared with HIV-negative women, those with HIV were 5 times more likely to suffer IPV (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.113, p = .001), and women who were not sure of their HIV status were 9 times more likely to experience IPV (AOR = 8.818, p < .001). Women who performed monthly self-breast exams were 53% less likely to experience IPV as those who rarely examined themselves (AOR = 0.470, p = .010). Women who have HIV or are unsure of their status and those who rarely perform self-breast exams are at increased risk of IPV. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Issues of Reliability in Measuring Intimate Partner Violence during Courtship

Author: Ryan, Kathryn M11 Department of Psychology, Lycoming College, Box 1, Williamsport, PA, 17701, USA, ryan@lycoming.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1549851592?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current paper focuses on problems in conceptualizing and establishing reliability when using self-administered measures of intimate partner violence to assess dating violence. Establishing reliability is an important step in the development of dating violence assessment instruments. However, the nature of dating violence can make it difficult to establish reliability. Most notably, measures of intimate partner violence in courtship yield data that are positively skewed, with almost no one reporting high levels of violence. This could have implications for the calculation of several forms of reliability that assume normality (e.g., Pearson correlations, intraclass correlations). In addition, there are other characteristics of dating violence that could impact reliability. For example, partner violence perpetrators do not necessarily use multiple acts (internal consistency reliability) or repeat specific acts (test-retest reliability). And, gender differences in the perception of partner violence may influence intra-couple reliability in heterosexual couples. Finally, statistical interdependence within couples makes current intra-couple reliability assessment suspect. Research is reviewed and recommendations are made concerning the establishment of test-retest reliability, intra-couple reliability, and internal consistency reliability for measures of dating violence.

Validity Concerns in the Measurement of Women's and Men's Report of Intimate Partner Violence

Abstract: The measurement of intimate partner violence (IPV) has proven to be more complex than originally anticipated and content and construct validity need to be greatly improved for IPV assessment. For measurement of IPV in the United States, these validity issues range from providing the most accurate wording for the content domain to controversies as to when violent actions are counted (e.g., self-defense) or whether to include mild aggression (e.g., psychological conflict tactics) that may be more normative and not harmful. The three major forms of IPV (i.e., physical, sexual, and psychological abuse) have distinct validity issues and may require different modalities for assessment. Gender needs to be considered when establishing construct validity due to differences in the meaning of aggression, impacts of abuse, and even patterns of violence for women and men. External threats to validity include potential bias of self-report and motivations when reporting on a partner, discrepancies in couples' reports, the influence of response styles, and design issues affecting reporting. Traditional methods used to establish validity for IPV scales are reviewed and critiqued. Recommendations for enhancing validity in IPV assessment are provided.

Intimate Partner Violence Assessment in an Historical Context: Divergent Approaches and Opportunities for Progress

Abstract: This paper provides a brief history of the assessment of intimate partner violence (IPV) in the United States. We examine strengths and weaknesses of the original IPV assessment approaches and describe the modifications and extensions that have been employed to improve our understanding of the multifaceted nature of IPV. We next discuss more recent movements in IPV assessment, including the assessment of non-heterosexual relationships, the examination of various (and often intersecting) forms of IPV, and the identification of qualitatively different types of IPV. We provide an analogy between the assessment of IPV and the assessment of other problems such as depression, and compare the differences between an assessment of symptoms and an assessment of impairment or harm. We conclude by highlighting the need for multi-method assessment approaches that can account for both the frequency and intensity of aggressive acts, as well as the context, motivations, and impacts of such acts, in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of violence in intimate relationships.

Lessons from Examining Same-Sex Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Baker, Nancy L1; Buick, Jessica D; Kim, Shari R; Moniz, Sandy; Nava, Khristina L1 Fielding Graduate University, 2112 Santa Barbara Street, Santa Barbara, CA, 93105, USA nbaker@fielding.edu

Abstract: Even though scientific and legal recognition of same-sex relationships has increased, same-sex intimate partner violence (IPV) has not been included in the core conceptualization of the research and theorizing about IPV. Because of its inherent disjuncture from the patriarchal and hetero-normative marriage model, battering in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered community needs a much closer examination. Examining the violence that occurs in same-sex relationships allows us to reframe how we look at IPV and scrutinize the ideological frameworks, cultural narratives, and stereotypes that have been set forth as well investigate further the predictors of violence and the use of scales created. This article reviews the research on same-sex IPV primarily within the United States. In placing the lessons of same-sex IPV in the foreground, we are able to uncover some common truths about IPV in general. Viewing IPV through a same-sex lens removes gender-based assumptions about the manifestations of IPV, enabling us to see how other cultural and systemic factors may contribute to IPV. At the same time, incorporating the experience of same-sex couples facilitates viewing gender as a marker for variables requiring further study rather than as an explanation. When we change our focus of IPV in such a way, we discover it is a function of a complex interaction of culture, social structures, social status, and interpersonal dynamics.

Methodological Considerations in Conducting Ethnocultrally Sensitive Research on Intimate Partner Abuse and its Multidimensional Consequences

Author: Mechanic, Mindy B1; Pole, Nnamdi1 Department of Psychology, California State University, Fullerton, 800 North State College Blvd., Fullerton, CA, 92834-6846, USA mmechanic@fullerton.edu

Abstract: Increasingly, attention has focused on ethnoracial disparities as causes and correlates of intimate partner abuse (IPA). Research may benefit from conceptualizing the experiences of ethnic minority women through the lenses of cultural, structural, and institutional inequalities expressed as racism, sexism, and oppression. To enhance the study of ethnocultural variation in IPA research and to promote cultural competence, we discuss a range of methodological issues pertinent to conducting ethnoculturally sensitive IPA research. Providing examples and recommendations from research on U.S. women, this paper explores ethnocultural considerations at each step of the research process: (a) conceptualization of the research question, (b) sampling, (c) recruitment and retention, (d) study design, (e) measurement, (f) statistical analysis, (g) interpretation of results, and (h) ethics. Recommendations include greater use of multiethnic samples of battered women from varying nationalities, and more within-group analyses to capture the substantial diversity and resilience observed within samples of battered women of color. Enhanced use of mixed-method designs combining qualitative and quantitative approaches are likely to lead to more nuanced understandings of the ways in which race, class, and culture impact the nature, dynamics, and impact of IPA. More inclusive research questions and ecologically valid methodologies are necessary for developing culturally competent, data driven policies and practices to promote social justice for ethnic minority battered women.

Ethnic Minority Women's Experiences with Intimate Partner Violence: Using Community-Based Participatory Research to Ask the Right Questions

Author: White, Jacquelyn W1; Yuan, Nicole P; Cook, Sarah L; Abbey, Antonia1 Department of Psychology, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, PO Box 6170, Greensboro, NC, 27402, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463010403?accountid=14925

Abstract: Current definitions, instruments, and processes for measuring intimate partner violence, including sexual assault, are insufficient to detect the nature and scope of violence against all women. To remedy this problem, we recommend the use of community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to develop culturally informed quantitative instruments that measure ethnic minority women's experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV). CBPR requires community members and researchers to work equitably together throughout the research process, sharing decision-making and ownership. This paper identifies problems with current measurement approaches and describes the strengths and challenges of the CBPR approach. We argue that this research orientation offers the potential for "flexible standardization" that can provide better estimates of the extent of IPV and sexual assault, and provide communities with the knowledge they need to address these problems in a culturally sensitive manner.

Social-ecological model of preventive activity in the field of exposure of children and adolescents to domestic violence

Author: Protner, Ksenija Domiter

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520336403?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article presents the social-ecological model of preventive activity as one of the possible models of preventive activity in the field of exposure of children and adolescents to domestic violence in Slovenia. The suggested model of the preventive activity has been founded on the basis of the research on expo- sure of Slovene adolescents to domestic violence, which was implemented on a representative sample of Slovene adolescents (secondary school students). The article also presents an overview of certain examples of good practice of preventive activity, found on a global scale, and the characteristics of existent preventive activity in Slovenia. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Despite the ongoing debate about intervention best practices for intimate partner violence (IPV), few researchers have elicited the perspectives of clients themselves about what interventions most effectively decrease violence and increase safety. Using qualitative narrative analysis methodology, the researchers conducted 48 client participant interviews and 5 staff interviews to better understand couples' perspectives of a multicouple conjoint treatment program for IPV. Several recurring themes included (a) group purpose and general service characteristics, (b) motivation for participation, (c) comparison with other services, (d) benefits of, (e) disadvantages of, and (f) suggestions for Couples Achieving Relationship Enrichment. Important research implications for community intervention are discussed.

Intimate Partner Violence Victimization Among Undergraduate Women at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)

Author: Barrick, Kelle1; Krebs, Christopher P; Lindquist, Christine H1 RTI International, NC, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494749442?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite the evidence that young and minority women may be particularly vulnerable to intimate partner violence (IPV), there is little research on the IPV experiences of minority undergraduate women. This study addresses this gap by estimating the prevalence of IPV and examining factors associated with experiencing IPV among undergraduate women attending Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCUs). Findings suggest alarmingly high victimization rates; however, factors associated with IPV among HBCU women are similar to those found in prior research with women in the general population. The results also suggest that some risk factors are differentially associated with experiencing specific types of IPV. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

HIV Testing and Intimate Partner Violence Among Non-Pregnant Women in 15 US States/Territories: Findings from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Data

Author: Nasrullah, Muazzam1; Oraka, Emeka; Breiding, Mathew J; Chavez, Pollyanna R1 Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV, Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, Mailstop E46, Atlanta, GA, 30333, USA snasrullah@cdc.gov

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been shown to be associated with higher rates of HIV infection among women, underscoring the importance of encouraging IPV victims to receive HIV testing. However, we do not know how much HIV testing behavior is influenced by IPV victimization. The current study characterized the association between individual types of IPV and HIV testing in a large sample of non-pregnant women in 15 US states/territories. The 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data were analyzed after restricting the sample to non-pregnant women. The dependent variable, whether a woman ever had an HIV test, was examined in relation to individual types of IPV victimization (threatened physical violence; attempted physical violence; completed physical violence; and unwanted sex). Associations between HIV testing and types of IPV were assessed using adjusted risk ratios (aRR) that controlled for demographics and HIV-related risk factors (intravenous drug use, sexually transmitted diseases, exchange sex, unprotected anal sex). Approximately 28.6 % of women reported ever having experienced IPV, and 52.8 % of these women reported being tested for HIV. Among women who had not experienced IPV, 32.9 % reported ever having been tested for HIV. HIV testing was associated with lifetime experience of threatened violence (aRR = 1.43; 95 % CI = 1.24-1.65), attempted violence (aRR = 1.43; 95 % CI = 1.20-1.69), completed physical violence (aRR = 1.30; 95 % CI = 1.13-1.48), and unwanted sex (aRR = 1.66; 95 % CI = 1.48-1.86). Women who experienced each type of IPV were more likely to have been ever tested for HIV compared to women with no IPV history. However, nearly half of those reporting IPV, even though at greater risk for HIV infection, had never been tested. Additional efforts are needed to address barriers to testing in this group.

Council-Based Approaches to Intimate Partner Violence: Evidence for Distal Change in the System Response

Author: Allen, Nicole E1; Todd, Nathan R; Anderson, Carolyn J; Davis, Shara M; Javdani, Shabnam; Bruehler, Vernie; Dorsey, Heather1 University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA, allenne@illinois.edu

Abstract: Communities across the United States are collaborating to create a coordinated response to intimate partner violence (IPV); ideally, this involves promoting best practices in the justice and human service systems and engaging a broad array of community sectors (e.g., human service; criminal justice; faith; business; education) to promote victim safety and batterer accountability (Pence, 1999). The current study examined the extent to which Family Violence Coordinating Councils resulted in change in the systems' response to IPV. Specifically, we examined judicial order of protection data from 1990 to 2005 to establish whether the formation and development of councils across the state of Illinois promoted the issuance of plenary orders of protection following the initial granting of emergency orders of protection. Such a pattern would indicate implementation of a best practice in the system response to IPV. Utilizing a multilevel logistic modeling approach, we found that the introduction and development of councils was indeed related to the accessibility of plenary orders of protection. The specific ways in which councils may have influenced such an outcome and the implications of this approach for research on council effectiveness are discussed.

Safe from the Start? An Action Research Project on Early Intervention Materials for Children Affected by Domestic and Family Violence

Author: Spinney, Angela11 Institute for Social Research. Swinburne University of Technology

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448999078?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper first considers the impacts on children who have experienced domestic and family violence and consequential homelessness. This is followed by an account of an Australian qualitative research project, Safe from the Start, which was designed to identify and form a register of intervention activities and therapeutic play for affected young children aged up to six. The key finding of this innovative applied research, substantiated by the participatory evaluation, is that effective early intervention with such children can be conducted by non-specialised workers and parents, given the right training and tools. Adapted from the source document.

Prosecutorial discretion for domestic violence cases: an examination of the effects of offender race, ethnicity, gender, and age

Author: Romain, Danielle M1; Freiburger, Tina L1 Department of Urban Studies, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, P.O. Box 786, 1133 Enderis Hall, Milwaukee, WI, 53201, USA dmromain@uwm.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448994394?accountid=14925

Abstract: Much of the existing literature on courts and sentencing has focused on judicial decision-making. Prior research on prosecutorial decision-making is more limited, with even less attention paid to the prosecution of domestic violence cases. The research that has been conducted has produced inconsistent results regarding the effects of legal and extralegal variables. The current study focuses on the effects of extralegal suspect characteristics on the decision to dismiss domestic violence cases in a large Midwestern county from June 2009 to December 2009. The findings demonstrate that gender and race have a strong influence on prosecutors' decisions to dismiss charges in domestic violence cases. Contrary to the focal concerns perspective, however, the results indicate that males and Black and Hispanic offenders are more likely to have their cases dismissed. Implications for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Who does what to whom? Gender and domestic violence perpetrators in English police records

Author: Hester, Marianne11 University of Bristol, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1433729280?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article discusses findings from first study in Europe to track domestic violence cases over six years through the criminal justice system and compare cases involving male and female perpetrators. Ninety-six cases involving men and women recorded by the police in England as intimate domestic violence perpetrators were tracked to provide detailed narratives and progression of cases, establishing samples with a single male or female perpetrator or where both partners were recorded as perpetrators. Domestic violence involves a pattern of abusive behaviour over time and the in-depth longitudinal approach allowed similarities and differences in violent and abusive behaviours used by men and women, as recorded by the police, to be explored. Gender differences were found relating to the nature of cases, forms of violence recorded, frequency of incidents and levels of arrest.

Effect of Intimate Partner Violence on Antenatal Functional Health Status of Childbearing Women in Northeastern Thailand

Author: Saito, Amornrat1; Creedy, Debra; Cooke, Marie; Chaboyer, Wendy1 Centre for Research and Training on Gender and Women's Health, Faculty of Nursing, Khon Kaen University, Muang, Khon Kaen, Thailand

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1492601221?accountid=14925

Abstract: We investigated the effects of physical, psychological, and sexual violence on the health status of women attending antenatal clinics at two tertiary hospitals in rural Thailand. We asked 421 pregnant women at 32 weeks gestation or later to complete a survey questionnaire. Participants reported high rates of psychological abuse (53.7%); threats, acts of physical abuse, or both (26.6%); and sexual violence (19.2%). Women abused during pregnancy had poorer health compared with nonabused women, in role emotional functioning, vitality, bodily pain, mental health, and social functioning. Given the high prevalence of violence and poor health status, routine screenings by maternity services is urgently required. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: We interviewed 12 Jordanian women who had experienced domestic violence (DV) and were receiving assistance at the Jordanian Women's Union (JWU). Our aim was to explore the history and factors supporting attainment of freedom from DV. Narratives revealed themes of DV toward girls; forced marriage; physical, psychological, or sexual abuse before and during marriage; and escalation and enduring DV. Escaping from DV required family and JWU support. In the context of a strongly patriarchal, religious society, we observed a process of resolution by shifting cultural values and themes of empowerment, with an undercurrent of suffering blamed on inequalities in the legal process.

"Holy Cow, Does That Ever Open Up a Can of Worms": Health Care Providers' Experiences of Inquiring About Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Williston, Courtney J1; Lafreniere, Kathryn D1 Department of Psychology, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494750022?accountid=14925

Abstract: Primary care health care providers (HCPs) are likely to treat numerous women who are victims of intimate partner violence (IPV). In this study, we used interpretative phenomenological analysis to analyze semistructured interviews with nine HCPs (six family physicians and three nurse practitioners) in Ontario, Canada. Findings center on how HCPs interpret and make sense of their experiences inquiring about and receiving abuse disclosures. Overarching themes that we identified were asking and disclosure as a journey and disengaging in order to engage. Our findings underscore the importance of training HCPs to respond flexibly to sensitive situations. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate partner violence among immigrant Nigerian women in the United States: An analysis of internet commentaries on the murders of nine Nigerian women by their male spouses

Author: Kalunta-Crumpton, Anita

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1559008044?accountid=14925

Abstract: From 2005 to 2008, nine Nigerian female nurses were murdered in the U.S. by their husbands. Other than media (notably internet) information on the incidents, this situation and the general issue of intimate partner violence (IPV) in the Nigerian immigrant community is yet to gain awareness in scholarship. This paper is a discussion of IPV in the context of internet commentaries posted by Nigerians in the wake of the murder incidents. The commentaries mostly attribute the murders to acculturative tensions in Nigerian patriarchal gender relations and economic-based gender role-reversal in U.S-based immigrant Nigerian families. The paper commences with a narrative of Nigerian immigration into the U.S. in order to situate Nigerian nurses in the migration process and to position Nigerian immigrants in IPV literature. It transitions into a description of data collection and analysis of internet commentaries upon which the paper is based, findings and discussion of findings, and a conclusion.

A Meta-Summary of Qualitative Findings on the Lived Experience among Culturally Diverse Domestic Violence Survivors

Author: Childress, Saltanat11 University of Maryland -- Baltimore, School of Social Work, Baltimore, Maryland, USA sdushalieva@ssw.umaryland.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448997846?accountid=14925

Abstract: This meta-summary study explores, extracts, and summarizes themes from related qualitative studies on the lived experiences and coping mechanisms among culturally diverse domestic violence survivors. Using Sandelowski and Barroso's meta-summary strategy, a systematic literature review of articles published between 1990 and 2010 was conducted using a qualitative approach. Of a total of 802 studies, nine met the study inclusion criteria. This meta-summary of nine studies confirms the recurring themes in primary qualitative studies in the literature that illustrate women's experiences of domestic violence. These themes include (a) the effects of violence, (b) the cyclical nature of violence, (c) normalizing and tolerating violence, (d) the strength and resilience of victims, (e) barriers to help-seeking, and (f) the role of substance use in domestic violence. The review shows key cross-cultural differences in women's perceptions of abuse and the causes and strategies for responding to abuse. The review also reveals the lack of studies on domestic violence among women from Central Asia and the former Soviet Union. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Among Stigmatized Latina Workers

Author: Fernandez-Esquer, Maria Eugenia1; Diamond, Pamela M1 University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, TX, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494298467?accountid=14925

Abstract: Latinas recently immigrated to the United States who work in bars or cantinas are at risk of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) due to the heavy drinking and sex-related expectations associated with their work and the stigmatized nature of their occupation. We explored the influence of demographic characteristics, substance abuse, and sexual risk behaviors on IPV reported by cantineras for primary and nonprimary sexual partners. Results based on interviews conducted with 669 cantineras indicate that length of residency in the United States and current sexual practices predict IPV perpetrated by both their primary and nonprimary sexual partners. There were also partner-specific predictors of violence related to the substance use and working practices of cantineras. Our findings have implications for understanding the partner violence experienced by this subgroup of stigmatized Latina immigrants and for the ability of current IPV research to capture their experience.

Relationship Status Acceptance, Alcohol Use, and the Perpetration of Verbal Aggression Among Males Mandated to Treatment for Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Crane, Cory A1; Hawes, Samuel W; Oberleitner, Lindsay M S; Mandel, Dolores; Easton, Caroline J1 University at Buffalo, SUNY, Buffalo, NY, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299959?accountid=14925

Abstract: Forty substance using, male offenders of intimate partner violence completed measures of alcohol use and relationship status acceptance during a pretreatment screening session. They also completed a measure of verbal aggression after each month of a 12-week intervention program. Treatment length, heavy episodic drinking, and relationship status acceptance were used to assess the frequency of verbal aggression at each of the four assessment periods in a repeated measures ANCOVA. Main effects were detected for both alcohol and acceptance variables such that greater verbal aggression was observed among participants with a recent history of heavy episodic drinking and failure to accept the status of the relationship with their female victim. The interaction between time in treatment and relationship status acceptance was significant and showed that participants who accepted their relationship status reported low verbal aggression across measurement occasions while those who did not accept their relationship status reported high initial verbal aggression that decreased over treatment.

The Relationship Between Physical Intimate Partner Violence and Sexually Transmitted Infection Among Women in India and the United States

Author: Spiwak, Rae1; Afifi, Tracie O; Halli, Shiva; Garcia-Moreno, Claudia; Sareen, Jitender1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Manitoba

Abstract: To investigate the association between physical intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexually transmitted infection (STI) in two national samples. Data came from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions Wave 2 (n = 34,653) and the National Family Health Survey-3 (n = 124 385). Ever-married women between the ages of 20 and 49 were asked if they had experienced physical violence by their partner in the past year. Outcomes were presence of doctor confirmed HIV and self-reported STI. Age at first intercourse was examined as a mediator of the relationship between IPV and STI. Logistic regression examined associations between IPV, age at first intercourse and STI. Compared to individuals with no physical IPV, risk for STI was higher for individuals who experienced past year IPV living in the United States and India, however once controlling for age at first intercourse, age, education, household wealth/income and past year sexual violence, the relationship between IPV, and STI was significant in the American sample [(AOR) = 1.65, 95% (CI) = 1.21-2.26], however not for individuals living in India [(AOR) = 1.75, 95% (CI) = 0.84-3.65]. Individuals with exposure to physical IPV are at increased odds for STI. Age at first intercourse although a marker of risk, may not be an accurate marker of risky sexual behavior in both samples.

Traumatic Childhood Exposures in the Lives of Male Perpetrators of Female Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Watt, Margaret E1; Scrandis, Debra A1 University of Maryland School of Nursing, Baltimore, MD, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1431812067?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite efforts to use behavior modification interventions for male perpetrators, intimate partner violence (IPV) remains a significant problem in some male-female relationships. Childhood exposure to traumatic violent experiences, especially when untreated, can influence adult behaviors. Little is known about these possible factors in the lives of male perpetrators of IPV and if they influence their violent behavior against female intimate partners. This study's aim was to explore the life perspective of men who have been violent with their female intimate partners using Gadamer's hermeneutic phenomenology. Nine men with a history of female IPV were interviewed twice over a 5-month period. Interview content focused on their experiences in childhood and adult lives. Four themes emerged from the qualitative interviews: (a) childhood and family issues, (b) school and mental health issues, (c) substance abuse and (d) legal issues. Traumatic violent experiences in childhood, such as physical and sexual abuse, frequently led to school problems, misuse of substances, and arrests for a spectrum of crimes. These results highlight the importance of identifying traumatic violent exposures through a brief two-question screen of all children in primary care. Implications for individualized mental health treatment of male perpetrators and recommendations for further research are addressed.

The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence, Substance Use, and HIV on Depressive Symptoms Among Abused Low-Income Urban Women

Author: Illangasekare, Samantha L1; Burke, Jessica G; McDonnell, Karen A; Gielen, Andrea C1 Department of Population, Family, and Reproductive Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV), substance use, and HIV are often co-occuring health problems affecting low-income urban women, and have been described as connected epidemics making up a "syndemic." Research suggests that each issue separately is associated with depressive symptoms, but no studies have examined the combined effect of IPV, substance use and HIV on women's depression. Interviews were conducted with 96 women recruited from community health clinics serving low-income women in an urban U.S. city. All women were over 17, not pregnant, English-speaking, without private insurance and had experienced physical IPV in the past year. Women were primarily African American (82%) and 82% were receiving income assistance. Twenty seven percent were HIV-positive, and 27% had used heroin or cocaine in the past 6 months. Based on the Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D ), 73% were depressed. Women who experienced severe IPV in the past 6 months were compared to women who experienced no IPV or psychological IPV only in the past 6 months; those who experienced severe IPV were 5.3 times more likely to be depressed, controlling for HIV status, drug use, age, and relationship status. Women who experienced severe IPV, were HIV-positive, and used drugs (7.3% of sample) were 7.98 times as likely to be depressed as women without these characteristics. These findings confirm that severe IPV is significantly associated with depression among urban abused women. Furthermore, this research suggests that the syndemic effect of IPV, substance use, and HIV could be even more detrimental to women's mental health. Health practitioners and researchers should be aware of the combined impact of the IPV, substance use, and HIV syndemic and consider how they can address the mental health needs of urban women.

Social Support Needs Identified by Mothers Affected by Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Letourneau, Nicole1; Morris, Catherine Young; Stewart, Miriam; Hughes, Jean; Critchley, Kim A; Secco, Loretta1 Norlien/ACHF Chair in Parent-Infant Mental Health, Faculties of Nursing & Medicine (Pediatrics), University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada

Abstract: In order to offer optimal supports and services for mothers affected by intimate partner violence (IPV), an understanding of these mothers' perceptions of support needs, resources, barriers to support, and preferences for support intervention is warranted. Moreover, the growing recognition of the effects of IPV on maternal-infant relationships and of the importance of these early relationships to long-term child health outcomes suggests interventions are needed to support optimal maternal-infant relationships in these families. Thus, 64 mothers exposed to IPV when their infants were below 12 months of age participated in a retrospective qualitative study to identify mothers' support needs, resources, barriers to support, and preferences for specific support interventions to promote optimal mother-infant relationships. Participants identified both personal needs (including needs for leaving or staying with the violent partner), along with intertwined needs to care for, and help, their infants cope with the experience of violence. Mothers reported that integrated services that include information and practical support from professionals with emotional and affirmation support from peers would promote positive, nurturing mother-infant relationships and healthy child development.

Multiple Mediators of the Relationships Among Maternal Childhood Abuse, Intimate Partner Violence, and Offspring Psychopathology

Author: Miranda, Jenniffer K1; de la Osa, Nuria; Granero, Roser; Ezpeleta, Lourdes1 Unit of Epidemiology and Diagnosis in Developmental Psychopathology, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299450?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of the study was to examine whether maternal depression, mothers' and fathers' parenting, child physical punishment and negative life events (NLE) mediate the effect of maternal childhood abuse (CA), intimate partner violence (IPV) and cumulative violence (both CA and IPV) on Spanish children's and adolescents' psychopathology. Furthermore, multiple mediator models examine whether IPV mediates the effect of CA on the contextual and family factors mentioned above. Three hundred and eighteen Spanish outpatients aged 7 to 18 and their parents were assessed using a structured interview and other instruments for measuring the study variables. Structural equation models (SEMs) showed multiple pathways explaining psychopathological problems among offspring of mothers who suffered CA, IPV and both of these violent experiences. In particular, mothers' depression mediated the link between maternal CA, IPV, cumulative violence and children's externalizing, and total behavior problems. Child NLE was an important pathway between maternal CA and total behavior problems, as well as between cumulative violence and both externalizing and total problems. IPV contributed to explaining the link between maternal CA and contextual and family factors, such as child physical punishment and NLE, which were in turn, associated with children's behavior problems. Findings show the complex interconnections between different types of violence and their harmful effects on the mental health of women and their offspring, as well as the need to extend our knowledge on this subject.

Comparison of Victims' Reports and Court Records of Intimate Partner Violence Perpetrators' Criminal Case Outcomes

Author: Bell, Margret E1; Larsen, Sadie E; Goodman, Lisa A; Dutton, Mary Ann1 National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA, Department of Psychiatry, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1431748116?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) victims often report feeling confused and uninformed about court proceedings, including even about the final disposition of the case against their partner. This is problematic because victims' decisions in responding to subsequent abuse may be significantly influenced by their beliefs about the outcomes of prior court experiences. Also, researchers often rely on victim report of court case outcomes; discrepancies between women's reports and official records may account for some of the conflicting findings in the empirical literature. In the current study, we compared the reports of case outcome given by 81 women recruited immediately after the final hearing of an IPV-related criminal case against their perpetrator with court records of case outcome. Findings revealed a fair level of agreement between women's reports and court files that was significantly different from the level of agreement expected by chance, but far from perfect. Level of agreement increased substantially when cases involving suspended sentences were removed. In reviewing these findings, we discuss the extent to which results can or cannot be interpreted as reflecting the accuracy of women's knowledge and review their implications for IPV researchers and court systems.

Managing intimate partner violence at the social services department of a Greek university hospital

Author: Papadakaki, Maria1; Kastrinaki, Eirini; Drakaki, Renanthi; Chliaoutakis, Joannes1 Technological Educational Institute of Crete (TEI of Crete), Greece mpapadakaki@yahoo.gr

Abstract: Summary: Although abused patients are thought to access the health system at a range of potential entry points, social services are usually the only referral option within the various hospital sectors. In Greece, little is known about the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) and the quality of care provided to cases of abuse at the social services. The current study explored the department's response to IPV cases in a Greek university hospital. Two different research methods were employed: qualitative and document research. Qualitative data were collected through personal interviews with the 10 social workers employed at the department. Document research involved the review of all registries and social history forms recorded between January 2005 and April 2009 at the department. Two predefined screening criteria were employed to identify IPV cases. Seven socio-demographic variables were abstracted from all IPV cases that met the inclusion criteria. Findings: Four main themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: 1) knowledge gap and openness to education, 2) poor assessment and recording practices, 3) concerns about intervention in confirmed cases, and 4) mistrust in referral resources. The document research revealed a total of 42 records (3.8%) having an IPV screening record present, out of the 1117 initially reviewed. The majority of the IPV patients were women (n=33, 78.6%), encountered at the age group of 2837 years (n=16, 38.1%) and presented mixed types of abuse (n=32, 76.2%). Applications: Developing training opportunities and introducing organizational changes could help social workers to better manage IPV cases in the hospital setting.

Perceived Decline in Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Bangladesh: Qualitative Evidence

Author: Schuler, Sidney Ruth1; Lenzi, Rachel; Nazneen, Sohela; Bates, Lisa M1 Scientist, Global Health, Population, and Nutrition Group, FHI 360, 1825 Connecticut Avenue NW, Washington DC 20009 sschuler@fhi360.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463034218?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Bangladesh government, nongovernmental organizations, donors, and advocacy groups have attempted various interventions to promote gender equality and reduce intimate partner violence (IPV) against women, but rigorous evaluations of these interventions are rare and few published studies have yet to show that any of them has had a substantial impact. This study presents qualitative evidence from four villages in central and northern Bangladesh drawn from 11 group discussions (6 with men, 5 with women), 16 open-ended interviews with men, and 62 women's life history narratives. The findings strongly suggest that IPV is declining in these villages as women's economic roles expand and they gain a stronger sense of their rights. Periodic surveys are recommended to measure trends in the incidence of IPV in settings where transitions in gender systems are under way. Adapted from the source document.

The Impact of Offenders Leaving the Scene on the Police Decision to Arrest in Cases of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Hirschel, David1; Buzawa, Eve S1 University of Massachusetts-Lowell, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1449052564?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article, the authors examine an issue that has not been studied in depth by prior research: the impact that fleeing the scene has on the likelihood of arrest in intimate partner violence cases. Using police data obtained from 25 police departments in four states, and controlling for a variety of incident, offender, victim, and jurisdictional characteristics, the authors find that an offender who flees the scene of the incident is more than 5 times less likely to be arrested than one who remains at the scene. The policy implications of the findings are discussed.

Frequency of Intimate Partner Violence and Rural Women's Mental Health in Four Indian States

Author: Stephenson, Rob1; Winter, Amy; Hindin, Michelle1 Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504423870?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the association between self-reported frequency of verbal, physical, and sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) and mental health among 6,303 rural married women (age 15-49), in four Indian states: Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. Data are taken from the 2002-2003 National Family Health Survey-2 Follow-Up Survey. The results indicate that experiencing physical, verbal, or sexual IPV is associated with an increased risk of adverse mental health outcomes. Our results provide support for the importance of screening for IPV in mental health settings, especially in resource-poor settings where both IPV and mental health are often overlooked.

Intimate Partner Violence and the Relation Between Help-Seeking Behavior and the Severity and Frequency of Physical Violence Among Women in Turkey

Author: Ergocmen, Banu Akadli1; Yueksel-Kaptanolu, Ilknur; Jansen, Henrica AFM1 Hacettepe University Institute for Population Studies, Ankara, Turkey

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1449058843?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explores the severity and frequency of physical violence from an intimate partner experienced by 15- to 59-year-old women and their help-seeking behavior by using data from the "National Research on Domestic Violence Against Women in Turkey." Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted to compare the relationship between severity and frequency of violence and women's characteristics. Of all ever-partnered women, 36% have been exposed to partner violence; almost half of these experienced severe types of violence. Women used informal strategies to manage the violence instead of seeking help from formal institutions. Help-seeking behavior increases with increased severity and frequency of violence.

Does Job Stability Mediate the Relationship Between Intimate Partner Violence and Mental Health Among Low-Income Women?

Author: Adams, Adrienne E1; Bybee, Deborah; Tolman, Richard M; Sullivan, Cris M; Kennedy, Angie C1 Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan adamsadr@msu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504421041?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) has detrimental consequences for women's mental health. To effectively intervene, it is essential to understand the process through which IPV influences women's mental health. The current study used data from 5 waves of the Women's Employment Study, a prospective study of single mothers receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), to empirically investigate the extent to which job stability mediates the relationship between IPV and adverse mental health outcomes. The findings indicate that IPV significantly negatively affects women's job stability and mental health. Further, job stability is at least partly responsible for the damaging mental health consequences of abuse, and the effects can last up to 3 years after the IPV ends. This study demonstrates the need for interventions that effectively address barriers to employment as a means of enhancing the mental health of low-income women with abusive partners.

Long-Term Relationships Among Domestic Violence, Maternal Mental Health and Parenting, and Preschool Children's Behavior Problems

Author: Yoo, Jeong Ah; Huang, Chien-Chung

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299148?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using 4 waves of a longitudinal dataset, this study tested whether maternal mental health and parenting at Year 3 mediate the effects of domestic violence at Year 1 on preschool children's internalizing or externalizing behavior problems at Year 5. After controlling for preexisting child effects and parenting stress, structural equation models revealed that maternal mental health mediated the effects of domestic violence for children's externalizing behavior problems. Parenting, specifically spanking, mediated those effects for both behavior problems of children. Domestic violence had direct effects on both types of behavior problems of children. These findings highlight the long-term effects of domestic violence on preschool children and the need for early intervention and prevention efforts for the children in violent families.

Domestic Violence Perpetrator Programs in Europe, Part I: A survey of Current Practice

Author: Hamilton, Leah1; Koehler, Johann A; Losel, Friedrich A1 University of Cambridge, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1439006237?accountid=14925

Abstract: Most research on domestic violence perpetrator programs has been carried out in North America. It does not yet provide a clear picture on what works with these offenders and cannot be generalized to other cultural and legal systems. Therefore, in Part I of this article, we present the results of a survey of 54 programs that were in place in 19 European countries that addressed the programs' practice and effects. The survey captured data about program design, delivery, administration, infrastructure, and other features. Most programs applied cognitive-behavioral, profeminist, or psychodynamic treatment, or a combination of multiple treatment types. There was a wide disparity in approaches to handling domestic violence perpetrators, and a particular dearth of high-quality evaluation throughout the continent. Possible explanations for this disparity and avenues for improvement are discussed, related to a systematic review of European outcome evaluations (Part II).

Domestic Violence Perpetrator Programs in Europe, Part II: A Systematic Review of the State of Evidence

Author: Akoensi, Thomas D1; Koehler, Johann A; Losel, Friedrich; Humphreys, David K1 University of Cambridge, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1439007529?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Part II of this article, we present the results of a systematic review of European evidence on the effectiveness of domestic violence perpetrator programs. After searching through 10,446 titles, we discovered only 12 studies that evaluated the effectiveness of a perpetrator program in some systematic manner. The studies applied treatment to a total of 1,586 domestic violence perpetrators, and the sample sizes ranged from 9 to 322. Although the evaluations showed various positive effects after treatment, methodological problems relating to the evaluation designs do not allow attribution of these findings to the programs. Overall, the methodological quality of the evaluations is insufficient to derive firm conclusions and estimate an effect size. Accordingly, one cannot claim that one programmatic approach is superior to another. Evaluation of domestic violence perpetrator treatment in Europe must be improved and programs should become more tailored to the characteristics of the participants.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520341272?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article provides an overview of research related to the treatment of domestic violence, with particular focus on distinguishing among specific typologies during the assessment process of couples counseling. After discussing research related to the assessment process, the authors include fictional case examples that illustrate scenarios in which couples counseling may be appropriate and when couples treatment is wholly inappropriate. Adapted from the source document.

'Who's Protected?' Exploring Perceptions of Domestic Violence Law by Lesbians, Gays, and Bisexuals

Author: Guadalupe-Diaz, Xavier L1; Yglesias, Jonathan1 Framingham State University, Framingham, Massachusetts

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504421072?accountid=14925

Abstract: Legal recourse is a vital avenue for many domestic violence victims. For lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people, these laws have historically been heterosexist. Considering the many states that are now inclusive of same-gender relationships, an existing data set was utilized to examine the influence of sociodemographic predictors on the perceptions of domestic violence law among LGB. Our findings illustrate that nonwhite LGB and those who have negative perceptions of law enforcement have the most negative perceptions of domestic violence legal protections as they apply to same-gender relationships. These findings have implications for service providers, advocacy and outreach organizations, and future research exploring the impact perceptions of legal avenues have on LGB victims.

Predictors of Intimate Partner Violence in a Sample of Multiethnic Urban Young Adults

Author: Acevedo, Bianca P1; Lowe, Sarah R; Griffin, Kenneth W; Botvin, Gilbert J1 Department of Public Health, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299819?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of the present study was to investigate risk and protective factors for intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization in a high-risk sample of predominantly minority young adults from low-income urban communities. Participants were 1,130 individuals (57.9% women) ages 21 to 26 who participated in a telephone interview assessing IPV victimization, violence-related behaviors, and sexual behaviors. Results indicated that about 20.9% of participants reported experiencing one or more IPV incidents in their lifetime. Based on previous research, we examined lifetime violence, lifetime number of sexual partners, number of children, education, and religious service attendance as predictors of IPV. Results from a multivariate logistic regression showed that lifetime violence-related behaviors, number of lifetime sexual partners, and number of children were significant risk factors for IPV. The link between children and IPV risk: (a) was moderated by education for women and men and (b) was stronger for women (vs. men). These findings suggest that training for coping with stress and anger, endorsement of safe sex practices, and greater support for education may be effective strategies for preventing and reducing IPV among high-risk populations.

Patterns of Work-Related Intimate Partner Violence and Job Performance Among Abusive Men

Author: Mankowski, Eric S1; Galvez, Gino; Perrin, Nancy A; Hanson, Ginger C; Glass, Nancy1 Portland State University, Portland, OR, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299562?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study assesses different types of work-related intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration and their relationship to perpetrators' work performance and employment. We determine if groups of abusive men with similar patterns of work-related IPV exist and then examine whether the patterns are related to their characteristics, job performance, and employment outcomes. Participants were 198 adult men (60% Latino, 40% non-Latino) from batterer intervention programs (BIPs) who self-reported their lifetime work-related IPV and job outcomes. Five distinct clusters were identified and named based on the pattern (predominance or absence) of different work-related abusive behaviors reported: (a) low-level tactics, (b) job interference, (c) job interference with threatened or actual violence, (d) extreme abuse without jealousy and (e) extreme abuse. Analyses revealed significant differences between the clusters on ethnicity, parental status, partner's employment status, income, education, and (among Latinos only) acculturation. The probability of men's work-related IPV substantially impacting their own job performance was nearly 4 times greater among those in the extreme abuse cluster than those in the low-level tactics cluster. These data inform the development of employee training programs and workplace policies for reducing IPV that affects the workplace.

Intimate Partner Violence in Older Women in Spain: Prevalence, Health Consequences, and Service Utilization

Author: Montero, Isabel1; Martin-Baena, David; Escriba-Aguir, Vicenta; Ruiz-Perez, Isabel; Vives-Cases, Carmen; Talavera, Marta1 Department of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain isabel.montero@uv.es

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1512219912?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of lifetime intimate partner violence (IPV) in older women and to analyze its effect on women's health and Healthcare Services utilization. Women aged 55 years and over (1,676) randomly sampled from Primary Healthcare Services around Spain were included. Lifetime IPV prevalence, types, and duration were calculated. Descriptive and multivariate procedures using logistic and multiple lineal regression models were used. Of the women studied, 29.4% experienced IPV with an average duration of 21 years. Regardless of the type of IPV experienced, abused women showed significantly poorer health and higher healthcare services utilization compared to women who had never been abused. The high prevalence detected long standing duration, negative health impact, and high healthcare services utilization, calling attention to a need for increased efforts aimed at addressing IPV in older women.

Trajectory of intimate partner violence and healthcare seeking over the life course: study of Japanese women in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan

Author: Kamimura, A1; Yoshihama, M; Bybee, D1 Department of Sociology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA akiko.kamimura@utah.edu

Abstract: Objectives: To describe the trajectory of, and examine factors affecting, intimate partner violence (IPV) and IPV-specific healthcare seeking among Japanese women over the life course. Study design: Life course study. Method: One hundred and one women, aged 24-80 years, who had a lifetime history of IPV were interviewed in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan in 2005 and 2006. Life course data were collected according to the life history calendar method. Hierarchical linear modelling was used to examine IPV-specific healthcare seeking over the life course. Results: Injury, formal or informal help seeking, public assistance, worse self-rated health status and smoking significantly increased the likelihood of IPV-specific healthcare seeking over the life course. There are significant cohort effects on healthcare seeking. The results suggest that women who experience IPV may seek healthcare services not only immediately after the first occurrence of IPV, but also later in life. Conclusions: IPV is not always associated with immediate healthcare seeking. In particular, sexual IPV is not significantly associated with healthcare seeking. Pursuing formal and informal help is associated with healthcare seeking. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

Exploring a Domestic Violence Intervention Curriculum for Immigrant Mexican Women in a Group Setting: A Pilot Study

Author: Marrs Fuchsel, Catherine L1; Hysjulien, Blaire1 St. Catherine University and the University of St. Thomas School of Social Work, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299212?accountid=14925

Abstract: In 2011-2012, a qualitative exploratory pilot study was conducted to examine the experiences of immigrant Mexican women using a culturally specific domestic violence intervention model curriculum in a Midwestern state. Using a psychoeducational group format, 20 immigrant Mexican women participated in two 11-week groups over a 9-month period at a community-based health clinic. Findings indicated immigrant Mexican women examined current relationships, dating, and domestic violence dynamics in group settings and reported changes in self-esteem within their own culture. Implications for social workers include learning how they can use culturally competent curriculums and programs in group formats. Adapted from the source document.

Learning From Each Other: The Special Cell and Domestic Violence Activist Responses in Different Contexts Across the World

Author: Hague, Gill11 University of Bristol, Bristol, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1567049233?accountid=14925

Abstract: Designed to act possibly as an anchor for other contributions, this article responds to the preceding article on the Special Cell for Women and Children in Mumbai, and offers a broad, brush-stroke overview of a selection of criminal justice-focused activist responses to Violence Against Women in India, the United Kingdom, and other countries. It reflects on the work of the Special Cell in the context of other women's support projects in police stations across the world, including Domestic Violence Matters, London, UK; the Family Consultant Service, London, Canada; and the women's police stations in Brazil. The article goes on to discuss the different activist responses in India and the United Kingdom, and both the contradictions around, and recent developments in, the activist provision of shelters worldwide.

Irish Divorce and Domestic Violence, 1857-1922

Author: Urquhart, Diane

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504421870?accountid=14925

Abstract: Ireland was excluded from the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857, which moved divorce proceedings from parliament to court. Whilst other areas of the Empire were encouraged to follow the 1857 reform, Ireland retained the costlier, lengthier and more socially and gender biased parliamentary process. Louisa Westropp's divorce of 1886 was the first divorce granted by Westminster to an Irishwoman and established legal precedent in applying case law, initially concerning domestic violence, derived in the divorce court to parliament. The result was an increase in Irish parliamentary divorce petitions, particularly from women, who utilised an augmenting definition of marital cruelty to secure a permanent release from spousal abuse. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Urban and rural geographies should be further included in feminist intersectional research on intimate partner violence (IPV). The article reviews existing research on the challenges facing rural victims of IPV. This research makes visible the specific problems rurality imposes on victims of IPV. However, research on rural IPV risks being misused and subsequently reinforcing othering and stereotypes of rurality and rural inhabitants. The article suggests that researchers alternate between intra- and anti-categorical approaches. On the one hand, rural victims of IPV should be analyzed as a neglected point of intersection, and on the other the diversity of ruralities should be acknowledged.

Familism, Sexual Abuse, and Domestic Violence Among Immigrant Mexican Women

Author: Fuchsel, Catherine L. Marrs11 St. Catherine University and the University of St. Thomas, St. Paul, MN, USA clmarrsfuchsel@stkate.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504421104?accountid=14925

Abstract: Immigrant Mexican women (IMW) experience domestic violence (DV) as adults, yet little is known about childhood sexual abuse (CSA) experiences and possible linkages between childhood and adult abuses. A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using in-depth interviews and grounded theory to examine DV among nine IMW residing in a southwestern city. Experience of childhood sexual abuse, domestic violence, and the role of familism on reporting and disclosing were categories that emerged in the data. Findings indicated seven of the nine participants had experienced CSA. Social workers in practice can utilize findings toward a better understanding of how to serve IMW.

Engagement strategies and change: an intentional practice response for the child welfare worker in cases of domestic violence

Author: Melchiorre, Rylee1; Vis, Jo-Ann1 Child Protection Worker, Family Services Unit, The Children's Aid Society of the District of Thunder Bay

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494298818?accountid=14925

Abstract: In order to engage mothers who are victims of domestic abuse, the child welfare worker needs to be challenged to develop an intentional practice response that includes knowledge and skill concerning the complexities of domestic violence, as well as the process of change. Developing a supportive relationship, understanding the stages of change (SOC) and engaging mothers as leaders in the change process are essential to successful child protection outcomes. Within the context of the SOC model, this practice-based paper focuses on the importance of engaging mothers who are victims of domestic violence in conversations about their own unique dilemmas, challenges and barriers regarding change. Through the inclusion of engagement strategies such as signs of safety, active listening and cost/benefit analysis, in concert with the SOC theory, the child welfare worker would be equipped with an approach to successfully assist mothers through their change journey, ultimately keeping children safe.

Feminist politics and framing contests: Domestic violence policy in Scotland and Wales

Author: Charles, Nickie; Mackay, Fiona

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494750954?accountid=14925

Abstract: Devolution in the UK in the 1990s resulted in newly gendered political opportunity structures for feminists seeking to influence the political agenda and pursue 'women-friendly' policy outcomes. There is, however, little work that compares jurisdictions across the UK. This paper provides a preliminary comparison of the politics of a classic feminist issue -- domestic violence -- in Scotland and Wales. We examine how, and with what effect, devolution has opened up opportunities to promote feminist frames and policy preferences. Despite some key similarities in Scotland and Wales, notably, high numbers of female parliamentarians, well-established refuge movement organizations and opportunities presented by aspirations for a new and more open politics, there are significant differences with respect to timing, framing and policy approaches in each place. In particular, we argue that asymmetric devolution has created different 'devolution effects' which in turn shape and constrain framing contests with different outcomes for feminist politics and for women.

Women's perceptions of how pregnancy influences the context of intimate partner violence in Germany

Author: Stockl, Heidi1; Gardner, Frances1 Social & Mathematical Epidemiology Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1512219839?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence during pregnancy is receiving increased attention because of its high prevalence and health effects. Still, little is known about women's perceptions on how their pregnancy influences the context in which intimate partner violence occurs. We conducted 19 in-depth interviews with women who had experienced intimate partner violence around the time of pregnancy. Women clearly perceived pregnancy as a turning point, because it created new expectations and a feeling of being overwhelmed. This led to violence by reducing women's acceptance of their partner's unemployment, alcohol abuse and lack of relationship commitment, or by increasing women's vulnerability because they felt too young to raise a child alone. Pregnancy also led to violence by bringing back childhood memories or by taking attention away from their partners. Understanding how pregnancy influences the context in which intimate partner violence occurs is important to provide abused, pregnant women with the services they need.

'I couldn't even dress the way I wanted..' Young women talk of 'ownership' by boyfriends: An opportunity for the prevention of domestic violence?

Author: Towns, Alison J1; Scott, Hazel1 Population Health, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand atowns@pl.net

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504423276?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this paper, we document and theorise 'ownership' practices in young people's intimate relationships and discuss the parallels with domestic violence. Ten young New Zealand women engaged in focus group discussions about their heterosexual partner's 'ownership' practices or jealous, possessive and controlling behaviours. Using discourse analysis informed by feminist poststructuralism and critical realism, we identified three proprietary 'ownership' practices experienced by these young women: 'ownership' entitlement, surveillance and identity 'ownership'. We discuss the parallels between these practices and those experienced by women subjected to men's domestic violence, the possibility that such practices may be precursors to the development of domestic violence and the implications for prevention.

Intimate Partner Violence Exposure in Early Childhood: An Ecobiodevelopmental Perspective

Author: Herman-Smith, Robert

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299302?accountid=14925

Abstract: Approximately 15.5 million children in the United States reside in households in which interpersonal violence is recurrent. Young children are more likely than older children to be present in the home when violence between adults occurs. In a recent technical report, the American Academy of Pediatrics renewed its call to invest in research and intervention resources for children younger than five years of age. The report also outlined the ecobiodevelopmental (EBD) framework, an emerging cross-disciplinary understanding of stress and coping response in very young children. The EBD framework explains how unresolved stress experienced by infants, toddlers, and preschoolers has toxic effects on their development. The framework could also expand opportunities for social workers who have an interest in research and clinical work involving very young children exposed to violence. Adapted from the source document.

Who should play a major role in responding to intimate partner violence? A comparison of Chinese and American college students' preferences

Author: Li, Jessica CM; Wu, Yuning; Sun, Ivan Y

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1464134510?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using survey data collected from 639 students in a Chinese university and an American university, this study assesses students' preferences for private, parochial, and public responses to intimate partner violence (IPV). The results show that Chinese students are in favor of a parochial approach, whereas American students prefer a criminal justice intervention to IPV. Preferences for different responses to IPV are predicted by locality, respondents' attitudes toward gender roles, tolerance for violence, and awareness of IPV. Implications for policies and practices to handling IPV in both societies are offered.

Competing Values in Serving Older and Vulnerable Adults: Adult Protective Services, Mandated Reporting, and Domestic Violence Programs

Author: Cramer, Elizabeth P1; Brady, Shane R1 School of Social Work, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA ecramer@vcu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494300597?accountid=14925

Abstract: State mandatory reporting statutes may directly or indirectly list domestic violence programs as among those that are mandated reporters of cases of suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation of older individuals and those with disabilities. Domestic violence programs, however, may not consider themselves to be mandated reporters, because the responsibility of reporting abuse may be contrary to their programmatic philosophy. In the Commonwealth of Virginia, the potential conflict between domestic violence programs and Adult Protective Services about the issue of mandated reporting has created tension between these organizations as each entity continues interpreting the issues and policies of mandated reporting through its own lens. The authors draw out some of the reasons for the conflict as well as make recommendations for improving relationships between the two organizations, which will ultimately benefit vulnerable adults who are experiencing abuse.

Abstract: This paper presents results from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of married women (N=3,500) in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Interviews assessed the 12-month prevalence of participants' exposure to psychological, physical, and sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) and risk factors including: demographic characteristics, several factors of marital relations, stressful life events, political violence, status inconsistency, family size, locality, region, help resources in the community, and locality-level acceptance of wife abuse. The prevalence estimates of IPV were: psychological aggression, 50 % minor and 12 % severe; physical assault, 17 % minor and 6 % severe; and sexual coercion, 4 % minor and 6 % severe. Results revealed that stressful life events, husbands' controlling behavior, and marital conflicts were related to all forms of IPV (all p-values<0.05). Greater locality-level acceptance of wife abuse was statistically associated with greater odds of each type of violence except sexual violence. The limitations and implications of the study for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

VHA Primary Care Providers' Perspectives on Screening Female Veterans for Intimate Partner Violence: A Preliminary Assessment

Author: Iverson, Katherine M1; Wells, Stephanie Y; Wiltsey-Stirman, Shannon; Vaughn, Rachel; Gerber, Megan R1 Women's Health Sciences Division of the National Center for PTSD, VA Boston Healthcare System and Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA

Abstract: Female Veterans experience intimate partner violence (IPV) at alarming rates. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires foundational research to guide the development of policy and programs to detect IPV among women Veterans and provide interventions. This pilot study reports findings from in-depth qualitative interviews conducted with 12 VHA primary care providers treating female Veterans in the New England region. Although most providers indicated that they were not currently routinely screening for IPV, they expressed positive attitudes and beliefs about screening in VHA primary care settings. Themes also included the importance of a comprehensive health care response to IPV, such as interdisciplinary coordination of care and team-based approaches to detection and intervention. Barriers to routine screening were identified, as well as recommendations for training programs and clinical tools to inform the successful implementation of a standardized IPV screening and response program in VHA. Although preliminary, these findings represent an initial step in an essential line of research. Adapted from the source document.

Healthcare Can Change from Within: Sustained Improvement in the Healthcare Response to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Ambuel, Bruce1; Hamberger, L Kevin; Guse, Clare E; Melzer-Lange, Marlene; Phelan, Mary Beth; Kistner, Amy1 Department of Family and Community Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA bambuel@gmail.com

Abstract: There is a great need to demonstrate sustained improvement in healthcare-based inquiry, intervention, and prevention provided to patients exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV). We evaluated implementation of the Healthcare Can Change from Within model (HCCW) in three primary care clinics and an emergency department within a large healthcare system, using two other primary care clinics for a usual-care comparison on selected variables. Outcome measures included individual-level variables (staff knowledge and attitudes) and system characteristics (clinic policies, procedures, patient education materials, and IPV documentation in patient records). Doctors and nurses reported increased self-efficacy, understanding of referral resources, and understanding of legal issues; IPV knowledge was unchanged. Intervention clinics implemented new policies and procedures, increased patient education, and increased documentation of IPV screening, an improvement which was sustained at 2-year follow-up. Results suggest HCCW is a promising practice for improving the healthcare response to IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence: Are Perpetrators Also Victims and Are They More Likely to Experience Suicide Ideation?

Author: Lamis, Dorian A1; Leenaars, Lindsey S; Jahn, Danielle R; Lester, David1 Emory University School of Medicine, GA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494749430?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study examined the relations among several risk factors-hopelessness, depressive symptoms, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, alcohol-related problems, and intimate partner violence (victimization and perpetration)-and suicide ideation, as measured by the Modified Scale for Suicide Ideation, in college students (n = 994). In addition, the overlap between being a victim and perpetrator of various types of intimate partner violence was examined. Results indicated substantial overlap in the victim and perpetrator roles, up to 96.6% for negotiation. In the negative binomial regression analysis, reports of hopelessness, depressive symptoms, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and alcohol-related problems all significantly predicted suicide ideation in the expected direction. However, none of the revised Conflict Tactics Scale subscales predicted suicide ideation above and beyond the established risk factors. Implications are offered for the improved identification and treatment of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among college students.

Interpersonal Style Moderates the Effect of Dating Violence on Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression

Author: Yalch, Matthew M1; Lannert, Brittany K; Hopwood, Christopher J; Levendosky, Alytia A1 Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299018?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over a quarter of young women have experienced some form of violence within a dating relationship. The experience of dating violence is associated with problems in psychological functioning, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, not all women who experience dating violence exhibit anxious or depressive symptoms. One factor that may influence symptom expression is interpersonal style. In this study, we examined the main and moderating effects of dimensions of interpersonal style (dominance and warmth) on the association between dating violence and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Warmth exhibited a main effect on anxious and depressive symptoms over and above the effects of dating violence and other life stressors. Dominance moderated the association between dating violence and anxious and depressive symptoms. When levels of dating violence were high, women with higher levels of dominance reported fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression than women with lower dominance. These results indicated that whereas high warmth was associated with fewer symptoms of psychopathology generally, high dominance was a buffer against the effect of dating violence on symptoms more specifically. Directions for future research are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

The Effects of Adolescent Intimate Partner Violence on Women's Educational Attainment and Earnings

Author: Adams, Adrienne E1; Greeson, Megan R; Kennedy, Angie C; Tolman, Richard M1 Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494749242?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious, widespread problem that negatively affects women's lives, including their economic status. The current study explored whether the financial harm associated with IPV begins as early as adolescence. With longitudinal data from a sample of 498 women currently or formerly receiving welfare, we used latent growth curve modeling to examine the relationships between adolescent IPV, educational attainment, and women's earnings. We found that women who had been victimized by a partner during adolescence obtained less education compared with nonvictimized women, with victimization indirectly influencing women's earnings via educational attainment. The findings support the need for intervention strategies aimed at preventing IPV and promoting women's educational and career development over the life course.

Substance Use and Intimate Partner Violence Victimization Among White, African American, and Latina Women

Author: Nowotny, Kathryn M1; Graves, Jennifer L1 University of Colorado at Boulder, CO, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494298301?accountid=14925

Abstract: The existing literature on intimate partner violence (IPV) does not paint a consistent portrait of the impact of race/ethnicity. In addition, although research has clearly demonstrated that there is a relationship between substance use and IPV, the temporal ordering of these variables is not clearly established. This article seeks to examine the temporal ordering of IPV victimization and drug use using longitudinal data with a nationally representative racially and ethnically diverse sample. Data from Wave III (2001-2002) and Wave IV (2007-2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) will serve as Time 1 and Time 2, respectively, to answer three research questions. First, does substance use during early young adulthood (Time 1) predict IPV victimization during young adulthood (Time 2) among women? Second, does IPV victimization during early young adulthood predict substance use during young adulthood for women? Finally, do these bidirectional relationships vary by race/ethnicity (i.e., White, African American, and Latina)? Four different forms of IPV (minor violence, major violence, rape/sexual coercion, and injury) are investigated along with binge drinking, marijuana use, and other drug use. Understanding not only the temporal relationship between substance use, trauma, and IPV but also the racial and ethnic differences in these relationships is critical to developing and refining culturally sensitive trauma-informed prevention and treatment services for women.

An Exploratory Investigation of Adolescent Intimate Partner Violence Among African American Youth: A Gendered Analysis

Author: Love, Sharon RedHawk1; Richards, Tara N1 University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, TN, USA

Abstract: Extant research demonstrates that while adolescent intimate partner violence (IPV) is an ever-growing concern in the United States, most research on IPV has focused on adult victims and offenders. To fill this gap in the literature, the present research examines youth IPV by conducting focus groups with 25 male and female youth between the ages of 15 and 19 years whose race was primarily African American. Drawing on open-ended responses by adolescent participants, the present study aimed to shed light on African American youths' perceptions of IPV, their perceptions regarding such violence among their peers, the dynamics of help-seeking behaviors, and what services youth perceive as most helpful in the prevention and intervention of adolescent IPV. Findings reveal that most participants only recognize physical aggression as IPV; express hesitation in disclosing violence to adults, especially nonfamily adults; and report being unaware of and/or unwilling to utilize existing prevention and intervention services traditionally targeted at adult populations. Implications for future research and policy are also presented and discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

The Perpetration of Intimate Partner Violence among LGBTQ College Youth: The Role of Minority Stress

Author: Edwards, Katie M1; Sylaska, Kateryna M1 Department of Psychology, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, 03824, USA katie.edwards@unh.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504423601?accountid=14925

Abstract: Preliminary research suggests that partner violence is a problem among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) college youth. However, there is no study to date with college youth on the factors associated with perpetration of same-sex partner violence, which is needed to inform prevention efforts specific to this population. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to assess how facets of minority stress (i.e., sexual-orientation-related victimization, sexual minority stigma, internalized homonegativity, sexual identity concealment) relate to physical, sexual, and psychological partner violence perpetration among LGBTQ college youth (N = 391; 49 % identified as men; 72 % Caucasian; M age: 20.77 years). At the bivariate level, physical perpetration was related to identity concealment and internalized homonegativity; sexual perpetration was related to internalized homonegativity; and psychological perpetration was related to sexual-orientation-related victimization. However, at the multivariate level (after controlling for concurrent victimization), psychological perpetration was unrelated to minority stress variables, whereas physical and sexual perpetration were both related to internalized homonegativity; physical perpetration was also related to identity concealment. These results underscore the utility of understanding partner violence among LGBTQ youth through a minority stress framework. Moreover, the current study highlights the need for a better understanding of factors that mediate and moderate the relationship between minority stress and partner violence perpetration among LGBTQ youth in order to inform prevention and intervention efforts.

An Epideictic Dimension of Symbolic Violence in Disney's Beauty and the Beast: Inter-Generational Lessons in Romanticizing and Tolerating Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Olson, Kathryn M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494748638?accountid=14925

Abstract: This criticism analyzes one epideictic dimension of Disney's Beauty and the Beast to demonstrate how the film's combination of sophisticated rhetorical strategies might cultivate a romanticized understanding of and tolerance toward intimate partner violence among inter-generational audiences. The film departs from earlier legend versions by focusing exclusively on the romantic arc and introducing various kinds of violence and new characters to exercise, interpret, and accommodate that violence. Pivotal to this particular epideictic dimension's operation are Beast's violent acts toward Belle relative to Gaston's violence toward her, adult characters minimizing, justifying, or romanticizing in the presence of a child character the repeated signs of intimate partner violence, and those adults' efforts to facilitate a romance in spite of Beast's violence and Belle's reluctance. Disney featuring child character Chip, with his questions about romance and front-row seat to the title characters' relationship (including violent episodes that resonate with the phases of Walker's Cycle Theory of Violence), underscores a coherent ideology explaining, on the approving community's behalf, the troubling intersection of violence and romance and (unintentionally, yet powerfully) endorsing that ideology's socially conservative, individualistic prescriptions for handling it.

Breaking Barriers: Addressing Structural Obstacles to Social Service Provision for Asian Survivors of Domestic Violence

Author: Lee, Mihan11 Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1567048957?accountid=14925

Abstract: Many studies have attributed the disproportionately high rate of domestic violence in Asian communities to Asian patriarchal 'cultural norms' and the psychological and behavioral traits that these norms produce in individuals. This article seeks to expand the scope of domestic violence analysis beyond these individual and cultural frameworks, arguing that Asian domestic violence is also a product of larger scale, social systems of inequality. By examining the funding criteria of the Family Violence Prevention Services Administration (FVPSA) and the Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) standard used by Robin Hood, my research shows how state and private organizations systematically devalue and underfund minority-targeted programs.

Outcomes of Short Course Interprofessional Training in Domestic Violence and Child Protection

Author: Szilassy, Eszter1; Carpenter, John; Patsios, Demi; Hackett, Simon1 University of Bristol, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1567048769?accountid=14925

Abstract: The interrelationship between domestic violence and child protection is well established, yet deficiencies in interprofessional collaboration have been reported and training is advocated as a solution. This study evaluates the outcomes of short interagency and interprofessional training in domestic abuse. Participants' attitudes and knowledge were assessed using a self-report scale and compared in a double-baseline time-series design. Participants (N = 177) were recruited from a range of agencies in England. There were consistent, statistically significant improvements in participants' attitudes, knowledge, and self-confidence between the start and end of course (p < .001). The long-term outcomes of training and the implementation of learning, however, remain uncertain. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Drinking context-specific associations between intimate partner violence and frequency and volume of alcohol consumption

Author: Mair, Christina1; Cunradi, Carol B; Gruenewald, Paul J; Todd, Michael; Remer, Lillian1 Prevention Research Center. Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494750139?accountid=14925

Abstract: To quantify two specific aspects of drinking in various venues (past-year frequency of drinking in each venue and volume consumed per venue) and assess their relationships with intimate partner violence. A geographic sample of married or cohabiting couples residing in 50 medium-to-large cities in California, USA (n = 1585 couples) was obtained. Cross-sectional survey data were collected via confidential telephone interviews. Each partner in the couple provided information about past-year male-to-female and female-to-male intimate partner violence (IPV), drinking contexts and psychosocial and demographic factors. Frequency of drinking in six contexts and volume consumed in those contexts were used in censored Tobit models to evaluate associations between IPV and male and female drinking contexts. Risks for IPV differed among drinking contexts and were sometimes related to heavier volumes consumed. In fully adjusted models, male partners' frequency of drinking at parties at another's home -- Beta [standard error (SE) 0.130 (0.060]; P = 0.030 -- was associated with risk for male-to-female IPV and frequency of drinking during quiet evenings at home was associated with risk for female-to-male IPV [Beta (SE) 0.017 (0.008); P = 0.033]. Female partners' frequency of drinking with friends at home [Beta (SE) -0.080 (0.037); P = 0.030] was associated with decreased male-to-female IPV, but volume consumed was associated with increased risk [Beta (SE) 0.049 (0.024); P = 0.044]. The social context in which drinking occurs appears to play a role in violence against partners, with male violence being linked to drinking away from home and female violence being linked to drinking at home.

Feminist Oral History and the Victorian Domestic Violence Services Movement

Author: Theobald, Jacqui

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520336603?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper explores some of the theoretical and practice issues in relation to feminist oral history. The central theoretical premise is that transcripts from interviews are to be understood as constructed texts rather than as windows into the past. It draws on the author's conduct of a research project that documented the history of the Victorian domestic violence services movement from 1974 to 2005. The author's position is analysed in relation to the production of historical evidence-which was done by conducting oral interviews and producing transcripts-and in writing feminist history.

Intimate partner violence and unintended pregnancy: prevalence and associated factors

Author: Azevedo, Ana Carolina da C1; de Araujo, Thalia Velho Barreto; Valongueiro, Sandra; Ludermir, Ana Bernarda1 Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, Brasil

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1629330726?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study investigated the association between unintended pregnancy and intimate partner violence before pregnancy. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 1,054 women, aged 18 to 49, in Recife, Northeastern Brazil, from July 2005 to March 2006. Non-conditional logistic regression analysis was performed with a hierarchical strategy for entering variables into the model, according to the conceptual framework defined. Unintended pregnancy was reported by 60.3% (636) women. Intimate partner violence prior to the pregnancy was associated with unintended pregnancy (ORadj = 1.57; 95%CI: 1.17-2.11), even when adjusted for the women's sociodemographic characteristics, the partner's behaviour, and the relationship dynamic. When the association was adjusted for the use of contraception and the partner's refusal to use contraception, the association was no longer significant, suggesting that the effect of partner violence on unintended pregnancy may be mediated by these variables. The findings point to the need of screening for intimate partner violence in reproductive health services. Adapted from the source document.

A professional approach to family violence against the elderly in a primary health clinic

Author: WANDERBROOCKE, Ana Claudia Nunes de Souza; MORE, Carmen Leontina Ojeda Ocampo

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1629329972?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article aims to describe a professional approach in a primary health clinic towards family violence against the elderly. This qualitative study collected data through participant observation recorded in a field diary, in addition to semi-structured interviews. Ten health workers from the clinic participated in the interviews. Data were analyzed according to Grounded Theory, and two categories were discussed: professional approach to domestic violence against the elderly and the clinic's management of situations involving such violence. The data point to professionals' difficulties in identifying violent situations and beliefs related to the inability to cope with it. In institutional terms, the data also highlight factors that hinder detection of cases, such as limited emphasis on interdisciplinary work and routines focused on physical health. The study suggests the need to offer health workers the opportunity to reflect on domestic violence and possibilities for intervention. Adapted from the source document.

'It's hard enough to deal with all the abuse issues': Child welfare workers' experiences with intimate partner violence on their caseloads

Author: Fusco, Rachel A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667948155?accountid=14925

Abstract: Child welfare caseworkers (N=19) were asked to discuss their experiences working with families experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). The workers revealed that they found these cases particularly challenging, they had a difficult time collaborating with both battered women's services and law enforcement on these cases, and they lacked the training and education that they needed to understand and intervene when IPV was present. Workers talked about their fears for their own safety and discussed how their practice is impacted when they personally know a victim and/or perpetrator of IPV. The interviews also revealed a somewhat limited understanding of the impact of child exposure to IPV. Findings have important implications for the training and education of child welfare caseworkers, and highlight the important of improved cross-system collaboration when working with multi-problem families.

Reproduction, Functional Autonomy and Changing Experiences of Intimate Partner Violence Within Marriage in Rural India

Author: Bourey, Christine; Stephenson, Rob; Hindin, Michelle J

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1512212900?accountid=14925

Abstract: The literature on intimate partner violence in resource-poor contexts relies primarily on cross-sectional studies. Because changes in women's status and empowerment are hypothesized to influence violence vulnerability, longitudinal studies are needed to determine the potential benefits and harms associated with such changes. Data were collected prospectively from a representative cohort of 4,749 married women in rural areas of four socially and demographically diverse states in India in 1998-1999 and 2002-2003. A multinomial regression model including social and demographic characteristics and intersurvey changes and events related to functional autonomy and reproduction was fitted to a categorical outcome measuring the absence (reference), initiation, cessation and continuation of intimate partner violence. Continued freedom of movement, increased freedom of movement and continued financial autonomy between baseline and follow-up were associated with a lower risk of violence initiation rather than no violence (relative risk ratio, 0.7 for each). Having a first child was associated with lower risk of violence initiation and continuation rather than no violence (0.6 and 0.2, respectively). Women who reported that their relative economic contribution to the household decreased or increased and women who experienced an unwanted pregnancy had a higher risk of violence continuation rather than no violence (1.8, 1.8 and 1.5, respectively). The death of a child was associated with higher risk of violence initiation rather than no violence (1.4). Future research to inform interventions to reduce intimate partner violence should consider how changes in women's reproductive experiences and functional autonomy may be linked to changes in intimate partner violence. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and the Feminization of Homelessness in Malta: A Critical Perspective

Author: Vakili Zad, Cyrus11 University of Toronto, Canada and the University of Malta, Malta

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1512218144?accountid=14925

Abstract: The majority of the homeless population in Malta are women and children. The main reason, I suggest, is the low status of women and the lack of power in the family bargaining process, which makes them vulnerable to abuse and violence by their intimate partners. After presenting evidence on Maltese women's low status, this article draws connections between the low position of women and the high prevalence of domestic violence and its resulted outcome: the feminization of homelessness. In addition to the published literature, this paper draws on three data sources: (1) the 2010 European Commission-sponsored survey, in which 26,800 citizens of EU-27 member states were interviewed regarding domestic violence (Eurobarometer 73.2, 'Domestic Violence against Women', 2010); (2) in-depth, interviews conducted with 1200 women from Malta and Gozo in February and March 2010 (Fsadni, The Prevalence of Domestic Violence against Women in Malta and its Impact on their Employment Prospects 2010); and (3) the results of in-depth interviews conducted by the author in June 2011, in Dar Merhba Bik, the main shelter for survivors of domestic violence. Although this study was able to find a significant association between Maltese women's disempowerment, domestic violence and resulted homelessness, additional work is required to see if this association is causal. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate partner violence and children's memory

Author: Gustafsson, Hanna C; Coffman, Jennifer L; Harris, Latonya S; Langley, Hillary A; Ornstein, Peter A; Cox, Martha J

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494751169?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study was designed to examine the relation between intimate partner violence (IPV) and children's memory and drew from a socioeconomically and racially diverse sample of children living in and around a midsized southeastern city (n = 140). Mother-reported IPV when the children were 30 months old was a significant predictor of children's short-term, working, and deliberate memory at 60 months of age, even after controlling for the children's sex and race, the families' income-to-needs ratio, the children's expressive vocabulary, and maternal harsh-intrusive parenting behaviors. These findings add to the limited extant literature that finds linkages between IPV and children's cognitive functioning and suggest that living in households in which physical violence is perpetrated among intimate partners may have a negative effect on multiple domains of children's memory development.

Internalizing and externalizing symptoms in young children exposed to intimate partner violence: Examining intervening processes

Author: Zarling, Amie Langer; Taber-Thomas, Sarah; Murray, Amanda; Knuston, John F; Lawrence, Erika; Valles, Nizete-Ly; DeGarmo, David S; Bank, Lew

Abstract: Children's emotion dysregulation, children's appraisals, maternal psychological functioning, and harsh discipline were investigated as potential mediators in the putative link between exposure to intimate partner violence and poor child outcomes. Participants included 132 children ages 6-8 and their mothers who had been enrolled in a longitudinal study of parenting and children's social development. The mothers were receiving some form of government-based economic assistance or other social services, and were currently involved in a romantic relationship. Results of structural equation modeling indicated children's emotion dysregulation mediated the links between exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) and both internalizing and externalizing problems. Harsh discipline mediated the link between exposure to IPV and externalizing, but not internalizing, symptoms. Child appraisals and maternal psychological functioning mediated the link between exposure to IPV and internalizing, but not externalizing, symptoms.

An Exploratory Analysis of College Students' Response and Reporting Behavior Regarding Intimate Partner Violence Victimization and Perpetration Among Their Friends

Author: Branch, Kathryn A1; Richards, Tara N; Dretsch, Elizabeth C1 University of Tampa, FL, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504424069?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over the last several decades, an extensive literature has documented the prevalence of dating violence on college campuses. As a result, initiatives to promote awareness of dating violence on college campuses have proliferated and models of 'bystander intervention' have been developed. Bystander intervention asserts that by giving all students information concerning the prevalence and warning signs of dating violence, these individuals will 'say something' when they see problem behavior. However, a paucity of empirical research exists concerning whether students actually report their observation of dating violence among their peers. In the present study, a sample of college freshman (n = 275) was surveyed regarding their willingness to report dating violence behaviors among their friends. Findings indicate that a slight majority of respondents report that they would report dating violence victimization among their friends to university officials (54%) and/or law enforcement (56%) while fewer indicated they would report perpetration, 38% and 42%, respectively. Importantly, respondents overwhelmingly report that they would attempt to intervene in the dating violence victimization (87%) and perpetration (84%). Implications of these findings for campus safety initiatives and bystander education models are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

A survey of mental health professionals' knowledge, attitudes and preparedness to respond to domestic violence

Author: Nyame, Sarah; Howard, Louise M; Feder, Gene; Trevillion, Kylee

Abstract: A high proportion of psychiatric service users experience domestic violence, yet most cases remain undetected by clinicians. This study aimed to assess mental health professionals' knowledge, attitudes and preparedness to respond to domestic violence. Information was collected on psychiatrists' and psychiatric nurses' knowledge, attitudes and preparedness towards the assessment of domestic violence, using an adapted Physician Readiness to Measure Intimate Partner Violence Survey. One hundred and thirty-one professionals were surveyed. Only 20 (15%) professionals routinely asked all service users about domestic violence and just 36 (27%) provided information to service users following disclosure. Most professionals (60%) felt that they lacked adequate knowledge of support services, and 27% felt that their workplace did not have adequate referral resources for domestic violence. Nurses reported greater readiness to assess and manage domestic violence than psychiatrists (p<0.001), despite psychiatrists reporting greater overall knowledge (p<0.001). Mental health professionals need to have clear referral pathways for service users who experience domestic violence, and to receive training on enhancing their knowledge and competencies to address domestic violence.

Undocumented Latina Networks and Responses to Domestic Violence in a New Immigrant Gateway: Toward a Place-Specific Analysis

Author: Reina, Angelica S1; Maldonado, Marta Maria; Lohman, Brenda J1 Iowa State University, Ames, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1557304034?accountid=14925

Abstract: New immigrant gateways differ significantly from areas of established settlement, with repercussions for domestic violence situations. Through interviews and a focus group with undocumented Latinas, we examine one specific area of such difference, that of formal and informal networks. These networks affect women's ability to seek and obtain help and procure their overall well-being. Findings suggest that the incorporation of Latinas into new gateways entails a reconfiguration of social ties and an increased level of isolation that renders immigrant women particularly vulnerable and ill-equipped to respond to domestic violence situations. We examine the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.

Intimate Partner Violence in Late Life: A Review of the Empirical Literature

Author: Roberto, Karen A1; McPherson, Marya C; Brossoie, Nancy1 Center for Gerontology at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1567043822?accountid=14925

Abstract: This integrated review of the empirical literature synthesizes a decade of scientific research across scholarly and professional publications addressing intimate partner violence (IPV) in late life. Deriving insights through a qualitative coding scheme and detailed analysis of 57 empirical sources, we discuss the theoretical frameworks, conceptual themes, and methodological approaches that cut across the literature. Based on these findings, we identify future research directions for improved understanding of late-life IPV as well as implications for policy development and refined community interventions.

'Criminals Are Inside of Our Homes': Intimate Partner Violence and Fear of Crime

Author: Broll, Ryan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1512219696?accountid=14925

Abstract: Based on findings that suggest women are more afraid of crime than men despite their overall lower rates of victimization, some scholars have suggested that personal experience plays, at best, a limited role in our feelings of personal safety. Feminist scholars have countered by arguing that many women are abused by their male intimate partners, yet this type of victimization is rarely considered in studies measuring fear of crime. Women's greater levels of fear, they argue, are therefore justified. This study draws on a nationally representative sample of Canadian women age 15 years or more to examine the relationship between intimate partner violence and fear of crime. The results of regression and cross-tabular analyses lend support to the feminist perspective, finding that physical and emotional abuse and severe physical abuse committed by male intimates generally increases women's fear of crime. The results demonstrate the importance of considering partner violence when studying women's fear of crime so as to not misrepresent women's fear as being 'unrealistic.'.

A Systematic Review of Interventions for Preventing Adolescent Intimate Partner Violence

Author: De Koker, Petra; Mathews, Catherine; Zuch, Melanie; Bastien, Sheri; Mason-Jones, Amanda J

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1542002096?accountid=14925

Abstract: Purpose Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive global health issue affecting adolescents. We reviewed randomized controlled trials of interventions to reduce physical, sexual, and psychological violence perpetration and victimization among adolescents. Methods: PUBMED, CINAHL, Science Direct, EMbase, PsychLIT, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane database were searched for English language papers published up to the end of February 2013. Results: Eight articles reporting on six randomized controlled trials were retrieved. Four interventions contained both school and community components. We found positive intervention effects on IPV perpetration (three studies) and IPV victimization (one study). Compared with the studies with no effects on IPV, the effective interventions were of longer duration, and were implemented in more than one setting. There were quality issues in all six trials. Conclusion: Interventions targeting perpetration and victimization of IPV among adolescents can be effective. Those interventions are more likely to be based in multiple settings, and focus on key people in the adolescents' environment. Future trials should assess perpetration and victimization of IPV among male and female adolescents with and without prior experiences with IPV, taking gender differences into account.

An Exploration of the Knowledge Base Used by Irish and U.S. Child Protection Social Workers in the Assessment of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Forgey, Mary Ann; Allen, Mary; Hansen, Johna

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1567043185?accountid=14925

Abstract: Child welfare practitioners in many countries now have increased responsibility for assessing intimate partner violence (IPV) as part of their child risk assessment process. Much research-based knowledge has accumulated about IPV and its impact on children that can inform this process. This exploratory study examined the extent to which research-based knowledge in IPV is influencing what child welfare practitioners explore in relation to IPV during their assessment process. Using a focus group format, two cohorts of child welfare practitioners, one located in Dublin County, Ireland, and one from the New York City metropolitan area, were asked what information they deem critical to explore about IPV, why they explore this content, and how they explore it. Results indicated that a wide range of information about IPV was reported as gathered by both groups, however, explicit research knowledge was not identified as a major influence for exploring these areas. Standardized IPV risk assessment instruments were also not reported as used by any of the participants. Other influences, such as practice experience, social work education, and legal or regulatory directives, had a much greater influence on the social worker's information gathering process in relation to IPV than research. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This article focuses on design, training, and delivery of a culturally tailored, multi-faceted intervention that used motivational interviewing (MI) and case management to reduce depression severity among African American survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV). We present the details of the intervention and discuss its implementation as a means of creating and providing culturally appropriate depression and violence services to African American women. We used a community-based participatory research approach to develop and evaluate the multi-faceted intervention. As part of the evaluation, we collected process measures about the use of MI, assessed MI fidelity, and interviewed participants about their experiences with the program.

An Exploration of African American Women's Perceptions of the Intersection of Domestic Violence and HIV/AIDS

Author: Bent-Goodley, Tricia B11 Howard University, Washington, DC, USA tbent-goodley@howard.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1531928973?accountid=14925

Abstract: The author explores the perceptions of the intersection of HIV and domestic violence from a cultural context among a sample of professional African American women, and how social workers can better respond to the intersection. While African American women compose 13% of the U.S. female population, they represent 64% of U.S. HIV cases among women. The aim of this study was to generate an understanding of how HIV and domestic violence intersect for African American women. Four focus groups were conducted with three cohorts of 22 African American/Caribbean American women for 12 focus groups. There were five major themes generated from the study: being from a low-income community is not always the major factor, relationships are complex and viewed as essential, HIV is serious but perceived risk is low, fear is a driving force of decision-making regarding relationships, and the strength of communalism is perceived as having diminished in the African American community. Implications for social work practice include creating greater awareness of the intersections between HIV, domestic violence and cultural context among African American women and to enhance the social work response to these intersections in practice, policy, and research.

Exposure to Family Violence and Attachment Styles as Predictors of Dating Violence Perpetration Among Men and Women: A Mediational Model

Author: Lee, Mary1; Reese-Weber, Marla; Kahn, Jeffrey H1 Illinois State University, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504422625?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined a multiple mediator model explaining how sibling perpetration and one's attachment style mediate the relation between parent-to-child victimization and dating violence perpetration. A sample of undergraduate students (n = 392 women, n = 89 men) completed measures of the aforementioned variables on an Internet survey. For men, path analyses found no mediation; parent-to-child victimization had a direct association with dating violence perpetration, no association was found between sibling perpetration and dating violence perpetration, and attachment anxiety, but not attachment avoidance, was positively associated with dating violence perpetration for men. For women, the hypothesized mediation model was supported; parent-to-child victimization had a direct association with dating violence perpetration, and sibling perpetration and attachment anxiety served as mediating variables. Attachment avoidance was not associated with dating violence perpetration for women. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

It's a Matter of Trust: Policing Domestic Violence in Hong Kong

Author: Leung, Lai-ching11 City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504424406?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article aims to examine the intervention approach of the police in handling domestic violence and the reasons behind the inactive response of police to domestic violence situations in Hong Kong. The study adopted a qualitative approach to data collection that included 20 in-depth interviews to survivors and 2 interviews to police officers. Findings of this study show that the police are likely to adopt a non-intervention or mediation approach rather than arrest approach because of their distrust of abused women. The police have different reactions in responding to domestic violence issues namely (1) stereotyping the victims, (2) cynical interpretation of women's motivation in reporting, and (3) disbelieve the problem is solvable. All these reactions are associated with the trust of the police that hold on domestic violence issues stems from the dominant patriarchy ideology. The beliefs of police are shaped by the male-dominated police occupational culture, which is characterized by sexism and suspicion. Such beliefs coupled with traditional family values and the dependency discourses prevalent in society have concealed the truth and reality of domestic violence.

Factors Impacting Counselor Competency with Sexual Minority Intimate Partner Violence Victims

Author: Hancock, Ryan1; McAuliffe, Garrett; Levingston, Kathleen1 Teacher Education Center, Northwestern State University of Louisiana, Natchitoches, Louisiana, USA hancockr@nsula.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1531930081?accountid=14925

Abstract: Grounded theory procedures were combined with a queer theory perspective to examine what factors promote counselor competency with sexual minority intimate partner violence victims. Ten counselors participated in two rounds of individual interviews. Results indicated that counselor competency building for work with this population occurred during and after graduate counseling programs. Analysis of the data identified specific desirable counselor traits, and useful training activities were identified to assist with developing counselor competency. The authors also discuss implications for clinical practice, counseling supervision, professional associations, service seminars, and counselor educators. Adapted from the source document.

Self-Determined Goals and Treatment of Domestic Violence Offenders: What If We Leave It Up to Them?

Author: Lee, Mo Yee; Uken, Adriana; Sebold, John

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1559003502?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite empirical evidence of self-determined goals and positive treatment outcomes, most conventional treatment programs of domestic violence offenders do not use self-determined goals as an integral part of their treatment efforts. The foundation for this article is a qualitative study that used data from 127 domestic violence offenders to explore the content and characteristics of goals that were self-determined by the offenders in a solution-focused, goal-directed treatment program. The emergent themes showed that the self-determined goals developed by offenders focused on self-focused and relational-focused attitudinal change and skills development. Three observed characteristics of these goals revolved around (a) emotional regulation versus cognitive understanding, (b) positively stated versus negatively stated goals, and (c) capacity building versus problem elimination. The implications of findings are discussed with the intention of generating useful dialogues among helping professionals to revisit treatment practices, orientations, and assumptions regarding treatment of domestic violence offenders.

Content and Framing of Male- and Female-Perpetrated Intimate Partner Violence in Print News

Author: Sellers, Brian G; Desmarais, Sarah L; Tirotti, Melissa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1559003738?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article investigates the content and framing of newspaper articles reporting male- and female-perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV). There were 173 newspaper articles coded for IPV severity, typology, and framing. Print news coverage of female-perpetrated IPV was limited; however, when reported, cases of female-perpetrated IPV were more severe, more likely to be described as perpetrated in self-defense, and less likely to be framed in terms of individual factors. For both male and female perpetrators, incidents of IPV were overwhelmingly framed as a private matter, whereas larger societal and cultural factors were rarely discussed. We discuss implications and make recommendations for broadening print media coverage of IPV to include the broader institutional, societal, and cultural causes of IPV rather than focusing primarily on individual factors. Adapted from the source document.

The Effect of Self-Efficacy on the Association Between Social Support and Relationship Alternatives Among Female Intimate Partner Violence Victims

Author: Tirone, Vanessa; Shorey, Ryan C; Nathanson, Alison M; Rhatigan, Deborah L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1559003771?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the meditational effect of self-efficacy on the relation between enacted social support and perceived quality of relationship alternatives among an economically disadvantaged community sample of 101 female intimate partner violence (IPV) survivors. Three types of support - directive guidance, nondirective guidance, and positive social exchange - were positively associated with self-efficacy. In each case, the effect of enacted social support on perceived quality of relationship alternatives was fully mediated by women's self-efficacy. Support in the form of tangible assistance was unrelated to women's self-efficacy. Above and beyond the impact of each type of social support, non-White ethnicity and frequency of physical violence were negatively associated with self-efficacy. However, race and violence frequency did not impact the mediational effect of self-efficacy. These findings support the inclusion of women's support networks in advocacy and therapeutic work with IPV survivors. Adapted from the source document.

The Role of Executive Function Deficits in Domestic Violence Perpetration

Author: Corvo, Kenneth

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1559003654?accountid=14925

Abstract: Of the probable psychological or neuropsychological vulnerabilities or risks in domestic violence perpetration, deficits in executive function may be one of the least explored. This integrative review contains overviews of domestic violence theory, the literature on psychological and neuropsychological risk for violence, the literature on executive function, and the literature on coping. The neuropsychology and neuroanatomy of violence typically involves deficits in the frontal lobes and their role in cognition and impulse control and/or excessive activation of the limbic structures with their role of mediating primary emotions and drive-related behavior. Domestic violence perpetration can be understood as maladaptive and destructive coping, symptomatic of disorders of impulsivity, neuropsychological impairment, and emotional dysfunction activated within the context of intimacy or primary relationships, often (if not usually) exacerbated by substance abuse or dependency. Conceptualizing domestic violence perpetration as maladaptive coping, impaired by executive deficits, psychopathology, often worsened by substance abuse, opens up a wide range of alternative intervention strategies. Instead of assuming (often incorrectly) that a perpetrator's intentions are only patriarchal domination, careful assessment of neuropsychological vulnerability and coping abilities can lead to both a more accurate picture of risk as well as guided change strategies. Assessment of executive function can provide a framework for understanding and improving both the cognitive capabilities of perpetrators to form and use adaptive strategies as well as their abilities to manage or inhibit affective arousal to violence. Adapted from the source document.

Motivations for Intimate Partner Violence in Men and Women Arrested for Domestic Violence and Court Referred to Batterer Intervention Programs

Author: Elmquist, JoAnna; Hamel, John; Shorey, Ryan C; Labrecque, Lindsay; Ninnemann, Andrew; Stuart, Gregory L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667947736?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research has attempted to elucidate men and women's proximal motivations for perpetrating intimate partner violence (IPV). However, previous research has yet to clarify and resolve the contention regarding whether motives for IPV are gender-neutral or gender-specific. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare motives for physical IPV perpetration among a sample of men (n = 90) and women (n = 87) arrested for domestic violence and court referred to batterer intervention programs. Results demonstrated that the most frequently endorsed motives for IPV by both men and women were self-defense, expression of negative emotions, and communication difficulties. With the exception of expression of negative emotions and retaliation, with women endorsing these motives more often than men, there were no significant differences between men and women's self-reported reasons for perpetrating physical aggression. The implications of these findings for future research and intervention programs are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence: The Role of Attachment on Men's Anger

Author: Genest, Andree-Anne; Mathieu, Cynthia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667948222?accountid=14925

Abstract: Previous research has identified men's level of anger as one of the predictors of intimate partner violence (IPV). However, few studies have tried to empirically explore the underlying factors influencing anger in men who perpetrate IPV. The purpose of this study is to identify the contribution of attachment style to the level of anger experienced by men perpetrators of IPV. Eighty men enrolled in IPV therapy completed self-report questionnaires of attachment and anger. Multiple regressions revealed that avoidant and anxious attachment styles had a significant influence in explaining anger in violent men. These findings indicate the importance of considering attachment style in the understanding and treatment of anger in IPV perpetrators. Adapted from the source document.

Examining the Prevalence, Bidirectionality, and Co-Occurrence of Sexual Intimate Partner Violence Among Women During Pregnancy and Postpartum

Author: Flanagan, Julianne C; Jaquier, Veronique; Gordon, Kristina Coop; Moore, Todd M; Stuart, Gregory L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667947717?accountid=14925

Abstract: This longitudinal study examined the prevalence of women's sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration, the extent to which women experienced both sexual IPV victimization and perpetration, and the overlap between women's experiences of sexual IPV with psychological and physical IPV victimization and perpetration. Data were collected via self-report survey from 180 women during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy and 122 participants completed follow-up assessments at 6 weeks postpartum. At both time points, the prevalence of sexual IPV victimization and perpetration were similar in this sample. Bidirectional sexual IPV was more common than sexual IPV victimization or perpetration only. Most participants who experienced sexual IPV victimization at baseline and follow-up also experienced psychological or physical IPV victimization. No participants at either time point reported sexual IPV perpetration only, those participants who perpetrated sexual IPV also perpetrated psychological or physical IPV. Future research should investigate women's sexual IPV victimization and perpetration as they relate to other areas of mental and physical health during this time period. Adapted from the source document.

Building Men's Engagement in Intimate Partner Violence Groups

Author: Roy, Valerie; Chateauvert, Joanie; Drouin, Marie-Eve; Richard, Marie-Claude

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667947559?accountid=14925

Abstract: Group programs, which are generally preferred in treatment with violent partners, often have a high dropout rate. Engagement, however, can be an influential factor in program completion (Rondeau, Brochu, Lemire, & Brodeur, 1999) and in maintaining those aspects learned by the end of the program (Contrino, Dermen, Nochajski, Wieczorek, & Navratil, 2007). This article looks at the meaning given by men to the concept of engaging in an intimate partner violence (IPV) group. In the effort to understand engagement, this study tries to identify characteristics, which are more representative of the complexity of engaging in IPV groups. Interviews and two focus groups were conducted with men who participated in group programs in two agencies in Canada. The qualitative analysis emphasized that engagement is not a spontaneous attitude but rather something that is constructed over time by striving to work on oneself. Limitations are discussed and implications for practice and research are explored. Adapted from the source document.

The Interaction of Emotion Regulation and World Assumptions in Predicting Female Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration

Author: Lilly, Michelle M; Mercer, Mary Catherine

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667948360?accountid=14925

Abstract: Rates of female-perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV) have been historically underestimated. Although, much of the empirical literature has focused on male perpetration, there has been a more recent interest in understanding the etiology of female-perpetrated IPV. Although emotion regulation has received attention in predicting risk for violence perpetration for both men and women, less is known regarding cognitive factors that influence perpetration risk. Furthermore, interactive effects that account for both self-regulatory and cognitive factors have remained largely unexplored. This study looks at the interactive effect of emotion regulation and world assumptions in predicting IPV perpetration in a community sample of females. Moderation analyses revealed that holding strong beliefs that one can and should be in control of oneself amplified the relationship between emotion dysregulation and IPV perpetration that was both psychological and physical in nature. Contrary to predictions, enhanced risk for physical IPV perpetration was also observed among those with high levels of emotion regulation difficulties and greater assumptions that the world is a benevolent place. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

The Use of Neuroplastic Change Principles in Domestic Violence Treatment: An Experimental Program

Author: Potter-Efron, Ronald T

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667948321?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reviews a unique 50 session domestic abuse prevention program for male aggressors that centers on the known principles of neuroplastic change. Neuroplastic change (also referred to as LTP: long-term potentiation) represents how brain structures at the level of individual neurons, the synapses between neurons, and the networks of neurons that create actual behavior can be permanently altered, both unintentionally and through directed conscious effort. The author has designed and implemented a program which allows clients to create individualized brain change plans intended to lessen the probability for future acts of domestic violence. This emphasis also sidesteps the client oppositionality by allowing clients to take control over their recovery. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work Expertise and Domestic Violence Fatality Review Teams

Author: Chanmugam, Amy11 Department of Social Work, the University of Texas at San Antonio, 501 West Cesar Chavez Boulevard, San Antonio, TX 78207-4414 amy.chanmugam@utsa.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520321779?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence fatality review teams (DVFRTs) are community-based, interprofessional initiatives developed to improve community services and coordination for victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) and to prevent IPV-related fatalities based on in-depth reviews of recent local cases of IPV homicide and suicide (Hobart, 2004; Wilson & Websdale, 2006). DVFRTs are proliferating across the United States, and social workers in varied employment settings are ideal members. DVFRT goals are aligned with social workers' goals of eliminating service gaps that prevent those most vulnerable from obtaining critically needed help. However, DVFRTs are rarely mentioned in social work literature. Searches of Social Work Abstracts (in all fields) using the key words 'fatality review' and 'homicide review' did not yield any results related to IPV or DVFRTs. The same key word searches in Social Service Abstracts (all fields) located just three works focused on DVFRTs, and all were part of a series of exchanges in one journal issue (Hauser, 2005; Websdale, 2005a, 2005b). DVFRTs are increasingly being implemented across the country. This practice update provides information on DVFRTs with three aims: to orient readers to DVFRTs, focusing on their purpose, methods, history, and ongoing evolution; to discuss social work skills and knowledge that contribute to DVFRTs; and to increase educators' ability to prepare future team members. Adapted from the source document.

The Integration of Healing Rituals in Group Treatment for Women Survivors of Domestic Violence

Author: Allen, Karen Neuman1; Wozniak, Danielle F1 Social Work Department, Arkansas State University, Jonesboro, Arkansas, USA kallen@astate.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1512212707?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes a therapeutic group for domestic violence survivors that incorporated healing rituals and rites of passage to help participants move past a 'liminal' state in which their social identity and personal narratives continue to be characterized by the abuse experience. Through the creation and use of healing rituals, blessings, poetry, art, and music, the women in the group establish 'communitas' and support each other in the work of self-reclamation and healing. The group, 'Rites of Passage' is intended for women who have completed shelter-based crisis interventions, and uses a structured curriculum that incorporates theoretical and philosophical concepts from anthropology, postmodernism, humanistic psychology, social work, and existentialism. Through the creation and practice of idiosyncratic and incorporated or modified existing rituals, women in the groups strengthen social bonds, develop a sense of hope for the future, reestablish an empowered sense of self, and continue their healing journey from domestic violence.

The Association of Intimate Partner Violence and Depressive Symptoms in a Cohort of Rural Couples

Author: Renner, Lynette M1; Habib, Leah; Stromquist, Ann M; Peek-Asa, Corinne1 School of Social Work, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, The University of Iowa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520320421?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of physical and emotional intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration and victimization among adult, cohabitating couples. The association between IPV and depressive symptoms, as well as the severity of depressive symptoms, was reported for both males and females. In a rural cohort study, 548 couples completed survey items concerning physical and emotional IPV, and mental health. Males and females who perpetrated physical IPV were 17.7 and 11.5 times more likely, respectively, to also be victims of physical IPV. Male and female perpetrators of emotional IPV were 18.7 and 5.2 times as likely, respectively, to also be victims of emotional IPV. Males and females with IPV histories were 3.0 and 2.4 times more likely, respectively, to have depressive symptoms (P < .001) than those without abuse histories. Females reported higher scores than males on the depressive symptoms index. This study suggests that many couples in rural areas use physical and emotional violence against each other in their relationships, and that both males and females who report a history of IPV are more likely to report depressive symptoms. These findings support IPV screening for physical and emotional violence among all patients and providing follow-up intervention programs in health care settings. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Neighborhood Income: A Longitudinal Analysis

Author: Bonomi, Amy E1; Trabert, Britton; Anderson, Melissa L; Kernic, Mary A; Holt, Victoria L1 Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA

Abstract: This investigation used a longitudinal design to examine the relationship between neighborhood-level income, individual-level predictors, and police-reported intimate partner violence in 5,994 urban couples followed over 2 years. At the baseline abuse incident, intimate partner violence rates were highest in the poorest neighborhoods (13.8 per 1,000 women in the lowest income quartile, followed by 12.1, 8.2, and 5.0 in the respective higher income quartiles). However, in the longitudinal analysis, weapon use at the baseline abuse event was a much stronger predictor of repeat abuse (incident rate ratios ranging from 1.72 for physical abuse to 1.83 for non-physical abuse) than neighborhood income.

Abstract: Low-income, ethnic, and/or displaced mothers are frequently victimized; we explored the burden of intimate partner violence (IPV) among such women. Teams administered IPV and maternal distress questionnaires to quantify victimization after the birth of a child. Of 250 mothers reporting abuse, 133 (53%) reported their husband hitting; 111 (44%) kicking, dragging, or beating; 61 (24%) choking or burning; and 33 (13%) injuring them with a knife or gun (12 case-patients per 100 person-years). Women who experienced more forms of victimization reported more distress (p = .01). Mothers in this low-income community experienced severe victimization and distress.

Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Across Medical and Surgical Health Care Settings: A Systematic Review

Author: Sprague, Sheila1; Goslings, J Carel; Hogentoren, Celine; de Milliano, Simone; Simunovic, Nicole; Madden, Kim; Bhandari, Mohit1 McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious health problem and a leading cause of nonfatal injury in North American females. Prevalence of IPV has ranged from less than 20% to more than 50% across primary care, emergency medicine, and family medicine. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to examine best estimates of IPV prevalence as opportunities for targeted interventions in health care specialties. We included 37 articles in this study. Based on our pooled data, best estimates of the lifetime prevalence of any type of IPV were 38% in family medicine and 40% in emergency medicine.

Calling the Police in Instances of Family Violence: Effects of Victim-Offender Relationship and Life Stages

Author: Kang, Ji Hyon1; Lynch, James P1 Korean Institute of Criminology, Seoul, Korea

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1512220912?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the impact of the victim-offender relationship on the willingness of victims to call the police in family violence incidents, with particular attention to the life stages of victims. Different stages of life have an impact on the decision to report criminal victimization. Family composition and the roles of family members change over life stages. When children are young, adults in the household have child-rearing responsibilities that shape the interpersonal dynamics in the household. When children approach adulthood and parents age, the parents may become more dependent on the children in a variety of ways. These changes in family composition and organization across life stages can affect the normative and cost-benefit considerations in deciding whether to call the police or not. Yet studies of responses to family violence have virtually ignored the influence of life stage on the decision to call the police. In addition, most studies of victims of family violence focus on marital or intimate relationships and fail to examine any other relationships in the family. It is not clear whether the findings from the general literature on domestic violence are applicable to intergenerational family violence. This article examines the impact of a broader range of victim-offender relationships across three age groups representing different life stages. The authors find that the factors explaining victims' decisions to report victimization to the police vary across life stages. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Category work in courtroom talk about domestic violence: Gender as an interactional accomplishment in child custody disputes

Author: Ingrids, Henrik

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520342829?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines how domestic violence and its effects on post-separation family life are dealt with within child custody disputes. Drawing on membership categorization analysis, audio-recorded courtroom testimonies from abused mothers seeking sole custody have been analysed. It was found that gendered categories like 'male perpetrator' and 'female victim' were central components in the mothers' accounts of their legal claims, serving to support their claims of fearing the fathers of their children. However, the analyses also reveal that the opposing party attempted to contest and undermine such accounts during cross-examinations by substituting the very same categorizations. Such re-categorizations, for example from 'female victim' to 'mad woman', take the responsibility for the mother's alleged fear away from the father. In exploring the relevance of gendered categories in mothers' accounts, the article provides empirical examples of the subtle and complex ways through which gender discourses are manifested in child custody disputes in order to support or contest legal claims.

An Exploratory Study of the Characteristics that Prevent Youth from Completing a Family Violence Diversion Program

Author: Nowakowski, Eva1; Mattern, Karen1 Barry University, Miami, FL, USA enowakowski-sims@barry.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520330912?accountid=14925

Abstract: Youth perpetrated violence against a family member has gained the attention of social service workers and law enforcement, yet professionals working with these youth have little understanding of the characteristics of the population that would impede intervention success. This article presents an exploratory study of youth (N=209; 50 % males and 50 % females, average age 15.7 years) who participated in a court-diversion program for first time offenders of family violence and examined socio-demographic and delinquency characteristics and the role they play in completing the program. Findings indicate that delinquency characteristics, specifically having a prior violent arrest and skipping school, carry significance in preventing youth from successfully completing the Family Violence Intervention Program. These findings lend support to the current literature and address the need for a more tailored approach to treating and retaining youth in a family violence intervention program. Adapted from the source document.

Effectiveness of Risk-Needs-Responsivity-Based Family Violence Programs with Male Offenders

Author: Stewart, Lynn A1; Gabora, Natalie; Kropp, PRandall; Lee, Zina1 Research Branch, Correctional Service Canada, 340 Laurier Ave. West, Ottawa, Ontario, K0A 0P9, Canada, lynn_stewart@sympatico.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1502380147?accountid=14925

Abstract: The following presents the outcome of an evaluation of family violence prevention programs for male offenders. The moderate and high intensity programs were designed and implemented to conform to the Risk-Needs-Responsivity (RNR) principles. Results showed that program participation significantly reduced attitudes that supported violence against women and improved pro-social skills related to non-abusive relationships; treatment effects were moderate to high. Parole officer feedback generally reported positive changes in behavior and attitude associated with treatment. A post-release follow-up indicated that program completion significantly reduced spousal violence and general violent recidivism. Program participation did not, however, have a significant impact on non-violent crime. Results indicate that domestic violence programs respecting the RNR principles may be effective in reducing partner violence.

Applying the Theory of Reasoned Action to Domestic Violence Reporting Behavior: The Role of Sex and Victimization

Author: Sulak, Tracey N1; Saxon, Terrill F; Fearon, Danielle1 Baylor University, Waco, TX, USA, Tracey_Sulak@Baylor.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1502412139?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence is a serious social issue that affects one in every four relationships. Interventions for victims and abusers are contingent upon reporting of the violence, but many cases are never reported. The theory of reasoned action may offer a model for understanding reporting behavior in adolescents and young adults. In a sample of 891 adolescents and young adults, social norms and attitudes were predictive of reporting intentions and subsequently, reporting behavior. For the purposes of this study, reporting behavior was defined as reporting the domestic violence to any individual not directly involved, which could include law enforcement personnel or other individuals who may provide assistance. Understanding how attitudes and social norms affect reporting behavior could be helpful for agencies serving individuals affected by domestic violence.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to develop a clinically valid and reliable audit tool that evaluates the assessment documentation of females presenting to the emergency department following an assault secondary to partner abuse. A 5-step process informed by a quality improvement approach was used to develop the tool and good inter-rater reliability was achieved. The tool developed has wide utility in services implementing family violence intervention in which nurses have a key role. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence, Minority Stress, and Sexual Risk-Taking Among U.S. Men Who Have Sex With Men

Author: Finneran, Catherine1; Stephenson, Rob1 Hubert Department of Global Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1512221035?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) among a national sample of Internet-recruited U.S. men who have sex with men (MSM) (n = 1,575), and associations between reporting of IPV, minority stress, and sexual risk-taking. Five outcomes are examined: experiences of physical and sexual violence, perpetration of physical and sexual violence, and unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) at last sexual encounter. MSM who reported experiencing more homophobic discrimination and internalized homophobia were more likely to report experiences of IPV. The results point to the need for prevention messages to address the external and internal stressors that influence both violence and sexual risk among MSM. Adapted from the source document.

In Circle: A Healthy Relationship, Domestic Violence, and HIV Intervention for African American Couples

Author: Bent-Goodley, Tricia11 School of Social Work, Howard University, Washington, DC, USA tbent-goodley@howard.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1551001401?accountid=14925

Abstract: While marriage and healthy relationship education has grown, limited interventions have been developed specifically to support the development and flourishing of African American couples. African Americans are also disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS and are more likely to experience lethality and serious injury due to domestic violence compared to Whites. Despite this, African American couples have been resilient and managed to thrive in relationships. Little has been done to capture these strategies, build on cultural strengths, and design an intervention specifically crafted for this population. This article describes an intervention 'In Circle' developed, implemented, and evaluated for African American couples to support healthy relationship and healthy marriage education. The intervention is based on an Ancient Egyptian value system and undergirded by three integrated theoretical perspectives. The article also includes implications for practice and research. Adapted from the source document.

Motivational Attributions About Intimate Partner Violence Among Male and Female Perpetrators

Author: Whitaker, M Pippin11 University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1512212909?accountid=14925

Abstract: Given the widely acknowledged negative impact and pervasiveness of intimate partner violence (IPV), many have sought to discover why people perpetrate IPV. To this end, IPV risk factors have been extensively studied and attributions have recently received more attention. Evidence suggests males and females have similar attributions and both engage in IPV. Yet, IPV tactics and attribution rates appear to differ by perpetrator sex. This study explores whether males and females tend to attribute different reasons to their IPV, and whether these attributions help to distinguish among physical and psychological IPV tactics. The study tests three hypotheses: that IPV tactics and attributions will differ between females and males, that females and males will have similar latent constructs associated with types of attributions made about IPV, and that males and females will have different relationships among attribution factors and IPV tactics. This study is based on a cross-sectional survey of 5,035 18- to 25-year-old undergraduate university students in the Southeastern United States. Analyses used SPSS 20 to conduct basic and bivariate analyses, multiway frequency analysis, reliability analysis, and logistic regression, and MPlus 6.12 to conduct exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Overall, the results provide support for the three study hypotheses, although there was inconsistency in findings for the second hypothesis. The results suggest important practice and research implications, which are discussed. The study fills a gap in the limited literature on IPV perpetrator motivational attributions by presenting a nuanced analysis of an early measure of IPV attributions.

Intimate Partner Violence and the Victim-Offender Overlap

Author: Tillyer, Marie Skubak1; Wright, Emily M1 Department of Criminal Justice, University of Texas at San Antonio, TX, USA marie.tillyer@utsa.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1512220990?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objectives: Examine the prevalence and correlates of intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization and offending, as well as the overlap of these experiences. Method: Data from wave 4 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were analyzed to examine IPV among adults ages 24 to 33. A multinomial logistic regression model was estimated to determine whether the correlates of IPV vary across victims, perpetrators, and victim-perpetrators. Results: Approximately 20% of respondents reported some IPV involvement in the past year, one-third of whom reported victimization and perpetration. The victim-offender overlap was observed for males and females across various measures of IPV. Bivariate correlations suggest victimization and perpetration have common correlates. Multivariate analysis, however, reveals considerable differences once we distinguish between victims, offenders, and victim-offenders and control for other variables. Perpetrators and victim-perpetrators were more likely to live with a nonspouse partner; feel isolated; display negative temperaments; and report substance use problems. "Victims only" were more likely to live with children and have lower household incomes. Conclusions: The victim-offender overlap exists for IPV across a variety of measures. Though perpetrators and victim-perpetrators have similar characteristics, those who are victims only appear distinctly different. We discuss the implications for theory, policy, and research.

Testing the Extent of the Gender Trap: College Students' Perceptions of and Reactions to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Sylaska, Kateryna M1; Walters, Andrew S1 Department of Psychology, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ, USA, kateryna.sylaska@wildcats.unh.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1549663580?accountid=14925

Abstract: Prior research has explored perceptions of intimate partner violence (IPV), and how these perceptions differ based on gender of the participant, victim, and perpetrator. In the current study, 178 undergraduate students (n=88 males; n=90 females) attending a university in the Southwestern United States read a hypothetical IPV scenario, experimentally crossed by victim gender and perpetrator gender, and completed measures exploring gender (i.e., participant gender, victim gender, and perpetrator gender) and situational perceptions on participants' intended responses to an IPV scenario. Results indicated that perceptions of the IPV situation and responses varied by genders of the participant, victim, and perpetrator. Specifically, males were more likely than females to hold the victim responsible for the violence, and ignore the situation; females were more likely than males to encourage the victim to seek professional help and seek help from another person regarding the IPV scenario as presented in the vignette. When the victim was a male, participants viewed the situation as less serious, the victim as more responsible, and were more likely to ignore the situation, than when the victim was female. Overall, results indicated that gender factors (especially participant gender) had a stronger and more consistent influence on responses to the IPV scenario than perceptions of the situation. The findings of the current study are discussed in light of implications for future research to expand an understanding of the role of gender and perceptions influencing anticipated helping behavior for victims of IPV, which will inform intervention.

Seismologies of emotion: fear and activism during domestic violence

Author: Pain, Rachel11 Centre for Social Justice and Community Action and Department of Geography, Durham University, South Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1531932270?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper explores the relation of fear to activism in private and constrained circumstances of chronic risk and anxiety. Asking how people contest domestic violence, given the intensity of the fear that it generates, the paper reframes their responses as practices of activism. It draws on qualitative research that charts the nature, experience and effects of fear over time. Using seismology as a metaphor for this process, the analysis describes complex and often hidden shifts in emotions over periods of years, as interviewees describe being simultaneously constrained by fear and actively using fear to manage and contest violence. Their practices of resistance are small scale, largely invisible to others, and have a messy and non-linear relationship with the process of leaving that some eventually undertake. Such action is only necessary in a social and political climate which continues to place more emphasis on individual than social responsibility for domestic violence. I examine what this resistance adds to recent accounts of activism, concluding that isolated actions constitute activism when they anticipate or engender collective social and political change at other scales. Adapted from the source document.

Marriage Migration, Patriarchal Bargains, and Wife Abuse: A Study of South Asian Women

Author: Chaudhuri, Soma1; Morash, Merry; Yingling, Julie1 Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541997522?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article contributes to the literature on wife abuse by using the patriarchal bargaining framework, which highlights the issue of agency as women strive to achieve their goals within the constraints of family and culture. Study participants were recent South Asian immigrants to the United States. Narrative analysis revealed that patriarchal constraints in natal families, culture, and expectations of benefits gained through marriage influenced many of the women to migrate for marriage. When husbands enforced extreme patriarchy with abuse, women's personal efforts to contain abuse were largely ineffective. However, advocacy agency interventions did help some women break out of extreme patriarchy. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Ethnic Group Differences in Police Notification About Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Ackerman, Jeffrey1; Love, Tony P1 Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1542002399?accountid=14925

Abstract: We analyzed data from the National Crime Victimization Survey to test whether individuals from different ethnic groups differentially notify the police after incidents of partner violence. After finding that minority groups notified the police about intimate partner violence (IPV) events more than non-minorities, we found that socioeconomic status differences between minorities and non-minorities explained a statistically significant proportion of the reasons underlying the differences in notification. We suggest that the pattern of our results supports a structural perspective and has potential implications about the subjective and objective efficacy of police involvement in IPV.

Abstract: Aims To examine the evidence of association between intimate partner physical or sexual violence (IPV) victimization and alcohol consumption in women. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies released before 6 June 2013. Studies providing an estimate of association between violence and alcohol consumption or alcohol use disorders were eligible for inclusion. Quality was assessed and random effects meta-analyses used to generate pooled odds ratios (OR) where appropriate. Higgins I2 where P<0.10 was taken to indicate heterogeneity. Results Fifty-five studies providing 102 estimates of association met the inclusion criteria. Most estimates were not controlled for partner alcohol use and other key confounders. Seven longitudinal studies provided 12 estimates of the association between alcohol and subsequent IPV; nine of 12 estimates showed a direction of increased odds of subsequent IPV, pooled OR=1.27 [95% confidence interval (CI)=1.07-1.52], I2=0%, P=0.437. Nine longitudinal studies provided 15 estimates of association between IPV and subsequent alcohol use; 14 of 15 estimates showed a direction of increased odds of subsequent alcohol use, pooled OR=1.25 (95% CI 1.02-1.52), I2=0%, P=0.751. Cross-sectional studies showed an association between IPV and alcohol use, pooled OR=1.80, 95% CI 1.58-2.06, but with substantial heterogeneity, I2=60.8%, P<0.0001. Definition of alcohol use partly accounted for heterogeneity in cross-sectional estimates. Conclusions There is a clear positive association between alcohol use and intimate partner physical or sexual violence victimization among women, suggesting a need for programming and research that addresses this link. However, the temporal direction of the association remains unclear. Longitudinal studies with multiple waves of data collection are needed. Adapted from the source document.

Community Matters: Intimate Partner Violence Among Rural Young Adults

Author: Edwards, Katie M1; Mattingly, Marybeth J; Dixon, Kristiana J; Banyard, Victoria L1 Department of Psychology, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, 03824, USA, katie.edwards@unh.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1502413166?accountid=14925

Abstract: Drawing on social disorganization theory, the current study examined the extent to which community-level poverty rates and collective efficacy influenced individual reports of intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration, victimization, and bystander intervention among a sample of 178 young adults (18-24; 67.4 % women) from 16 rural counties across the eastern US who completed an online survey that assessed demographic information, IPV perpetration, victimization, bystander intervention, and collective efficacy. We computed each county's poverty rate from the 2007-2011 American Community Survey. Generalized estimating equations demonstrated that after controlling for individual-level income status, community-level poverty positively predicted IPV victimization and perpetration for both men and women. Collective efficacy was inversely related to IPV victimization and perpetration for men; however, collective efficacy was unrelated to IPV victimization and perpetration for women. Whereas IPV bystander intervention was positively related to collective efficacy and inversely related to individual-level income status for both men and women, community-level poverty was unrelated to IPV bystander intervention for both men and women. Overall, these findings provide some support for social disorganization theory in explaining IPV among rural young adults, and underscore the importance of multi-level IPV prevention and intervention efforts focused around community-capacity building and enhancement of collective efficacy.

Barriers to Addressing Substance Abuse in Domestic Violence Court

Author: Riger, Stephanie1; Bennett, Larry W; Sigurvinsdottir, Rannveig1 University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA, sriger@uic.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1502440589?accountid=14925

Abstract: Substance abuse commonly co-occurs with intimate partner violence among both perpetrators and survivors. Specialized courts that focus on intimate partner violence provide a unique opportunity to address both problems simultaneously, but research has yet to identify whether this happens. In this qualitative study of a domestic violence court in a large midwestern metropolitan area, key informants were interviewed to understand how the Court treats substance abuse. Results indicate that substance abuse typically is not identified among perpetrators or survivors going through the Court unless it is mentioned in a police report. Barriers to such identification are the organization of the Court, bounded definition of actors' roles in the Court, limited resources, and negative attitudes towards survivors. These results suggest that specialized courts that attend to only one problem may overlook the possibility of addressing issues that commonly co-occur.

Mediator and Survivor Perspectives on Screening for Intimate Partner Abuse

Author: Bingham, Shereen G; Beldin, Kerry L; Dendinger, Laura

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1551002959?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study illuminates how family mediators and domestic violence survivors in Nebraska perceive the process used to screen parents for intimate partner abuse prior to parenting plan mediation. In-depth interviews and a focus group discussion were conducted and qualitatively analyzed to compare the mediators' and survivors' perspectives and suggest what the mediators might learn about screening from the standpoint of the survivors. Both similarities and differences in perspective emerged, with mediators less attentive than survivors to several concerns that appear central to screening from the survivors' standpoint. Implications for the screening practices of family mediators are discussed. . Adapted from the source document.

Reactive Versus Proactive Attitudes Toward Domestic Violence: A Comparison of Taiwanese Male and Female Police Officers

Author: Chu, Doris C1; Sun, Ivan Y1 Arkansas State University, Jonesboro, AR, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520331103?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although there has been a growing research interest in examining factors associated with police arrest decisions and victims' perceptions of the police in handling domestic violence, very few studies have empirically assessed female and male officers' attitudes toward domestic violence. Using survey data collected from 272 male and female officers from two metropolitan police departments in Taiwan, this research compared male and female police officers' reactive and proactive attitudes toward handling domestic violence incidents. The findings indicated that male officers were more likely than female officers to support minimum police involvement and to tolerate domestic violence. With regard to proactive attitudes, there was no significant gender difference in officers' endorsement of proarrest policy and the importance of domestic violence in police work. Implications for future research and policy are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Evidence-Based Prosecution of Intimate Partner Violence in the Post-Crawford Era: A Single-City Study of the Factors Leading to Prosecution

Author: Messing, Jill Theresa11 School of Social Work, Arizona State University, Phoenix, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520319146?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Crawford v. Washington decision has prompted changes in the way that intimate partner violence (IPV) is prosecuted. This research uses logistic regression to examine the victim, offender, and offense characteristics associated with the decision to prosecute a sample (N = 904) of domestic violence arrestees under an evidence-based prosecution strategy post-Crawford. Documentation of injury and police taking the perpetrator into custody at the scene of the crime have the greatest effect on the decision to prosecute, although the victim's willingness to assist with prosecution is also a significant factor. Future researchers should seek to replicate these findings, better understand current prosecution strategies, and determine the criminal justice and social service interventions best equipped to combat IPV in the post-Crawford era.

The Overlap Between Offending Trajectories, Criminal Violence, and Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Piquero, Alex R1; Theobald, Delphine; Farrington, David P1 University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520342851?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article investigates the overlap between offending trajectories, criminal violence, and intimate partner violence (IPV) and the factors associated with these behaviors. Knowledge on these questions is relevant to theory and policy. For the former, this article considers the extent to which specific theories are needed for understanding crime, criminal violence, and/or IPV, whereas for the latter, it may suggest specific offense- and offender-based policies. We use data from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development that traces the offending, criminal violence, and IPV of males to age 50. Findings show that there is significant overlap between criminal violence and IPV, high-rate offending trajectories have increased odds of criminal violence and IPV, and early childhood risk factors have no additional effect on criminal violence and IPV in adulthood over and above the offending trajectories.

Relationship Power As a Mediator of Intimate Partner Violence and Mental Health Issues Among Incarcerated, Substance-Using Women

Author: Minieri, Alexandra M1; Staton-Tindall, Michele; Leukefeld, Carl; Clarke, Jennifer G; Surratt, Hilary L; Frisman, Linda K1 University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine perceived relationship power as a mediator of the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and mental health issues among incarcerated women with a history of substance use. Cross-sectional data from 304 women as part of the Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Studies (CJ-DATS) were used to evaluate this hypothesis. Regression analyses examined the mediation relationship of perceived relationship power in the association between a history of IPV and mental health issues. Results supported the hypothesis, suggesting that perceived relationship power helps to explain the association between IPV and mental health issues. Implications of the findings for the provision of services to address the needs of these women are discussed, including assessment of perceived relationship power and focusing counseling interventions on women's experiences with power in intimate relationships.

In-Home Social Networks and Positive Adjustment in Children Witnessing Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Miller, Laura E1; VanZomeren-Dohm, Adrienne; Howell, Kathryn H; Hunter, Erin C; Graham-Bermann, Sandra A1 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1497452852?accountid=14925

Abstract: Evidence suggests that social support may act as a potential protective factor for psychological maladjustment, but few studies have examined the social support networks of young children exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV). The present study examined the in-home networks for 120 preschool-age children who were recently exposed to male-to-female IPV. Results indicated that larger in-home networks were associated with fewer child internalizing and externalizing problems. Mother's education level was found to moderate the relationship between total in-home network size and child adjustment, such that that when mothers had low levels of education, children had fewer overall adjustment problems as network size increased. When mothers had high levels of education, child adjustment did not significantly vary as network size increased. These findings suggest that the presence of extended family members in the home can positively influence child functioning following exposure to male-to-female IPV.

Intimate Partner Violence and Depressive Symptoms during Adolescence and Young Adulthood

Author: Johnson, Wendi L; Giordano, Peggy C; Longmore, Monica A; Manning, Wendy D

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520333895?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using longitudinal data from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study, we examine the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and depressive symptoms during adolescence and young adulthood (N = 1,273) while controlling for time-stable and time-varying correlates. Results show temporal changes in depressive symptoms, such that increases in depressive symptoms correspond to IPV exposure. While prior work has theorized that certain populations may be at increased psychological vulnerability from IPV, results indicate that both perpetration and victimization are associated with increases in depressive symptoms for both men and women, and irrespective of whether IPV exposure occurred in adolescence or young adulthood. Cumulative exposure to IPV does not appear to increase depressive symptoms beyond the effect observed for the most recent IPV exposure, but physical maltreatment by a parent does appear to diminish the association between IPV perpetration and depressive symptoms for a small subset of the sample. Adapted from the source document.

"He Said They'd Deport Me": Factors Influencing Domestic Violence Help-Seeking Practices Among Latina Immigrants

Author: Reina, Angelica S1; Lohman, Brenda J; Maldonado, Marta Maria1 Iowa State University, Ames, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1497552554?accountid=14925

Abstract: Significant developments have been made in research on domestic violence experienced by women as well as on the practical front of the services women seek and receive when living with partner abuse. Yet, most of the studies that explore the experiences of victims of partner abuse in the United States have focused on nonimmigrant White women. The current study aims to contribute to the literature by exploring Latina immigrant victims' experiences with domestic violence service outreach in the Midwest. This exploratory study used one-on-one interviews and a focus group to identify the challenges faced by 10 Latina victims of partner abuse who had previously contacted an antiviolence organization in Iowa and had used its services. Findings demonstrate that immigration status and the inability to understand domestic violence within given cultural norms are major barriers keeping Latina victims from seeking help from formal advocacy agencies. Other impediments include feeling shame, isolation, along with the lack of bilingual service providers in mainstream institutions and, the lack of knowledge about resources among newcomers. We end with recommendations for research and practice.

Dating Violence and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Taiwanese College Students: The Roles of Cultural Beliefs

Author: Shen, April Chiung-Tao11 National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1497498090?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study has examined the effects that young adults' experience of dating-violence victimization can have on their manifestation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. This study has also examined the possible roles that cultural beliefs can play in dating-violence experience, coping choices, and PTSD symptoms. This study has used self-reporting measures to collect data from a nationally stratified random sample of 1,018 college students in Taiwan. Results demonstrate that college students who had experienced dating-violence victimization reported higher levels of PTSD symptoms than those who had not. The results reveal that psychological-violence victimization and cultural beliefs have direct and indirect effects on PTSD symptoms via the mediation of young adults' use of emotion-focused coping strategies. Greater frequencies of psychological-violence victimization were associated with a greater use of emotion-focused coping, which was in turn associated with increases in PTSD symptoms. This study illustrates that traditional Chinese beliefs have played significant roles in exacerbating the risk for dating violence and PTSD, and in shaping victims' coping choices with dating violence.

Sociodemographic Characteristics of Domestic Violence in China: A Population Case-Control Study

Author: Cao, YuPing1; Yang, ShiChang; Wang, GuoQiang; Zhang, YaLin1 Mental Health Institute, Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1497495550?accountid=14925

Abstract: A population case-control study of domestic violence in China was conducted to examine the relationship between individual- and household-level characteristics and violence perpetration and victimization. Demographic comparisons were conducted between perpetrators and victims (n = 624), perpetrators and matched controls (n = 628), and perpetrator households and control households (n = 620). A multivariate model of demographic risk was tested, integrating individual- and household-level correlates of violence perpetration. Compared with victims, perpetrators were more likely to be older, male, and have lower levels of education. In the final model, violence perpetration was more likely among individuals who earned more income, contributed a lower proportion of the household income, had a family member who was unemployed or lived in households with an authoritarian or independent power structure.

Responses to and Resources for Intimate Partner Violence: Qualitative Findings From Women, Men, and Service Providers in Rural Kenya

Author: Odero, Merab1; Hatcher, Abigail M; Bryant, Chenoia; Onono, Maricianah; Romito, Patrizia; Bukusi, Elizabeth A; Turan, Janet M1 Kenya Medical Research Institute, Nairobi, Kenya

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1497422668?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is reported by one in three women globally, but the prevalence is much higher in East Africa. Though some formal and informal resources do exist for women experiencing IPV, data suggest that disclosure, help seeking, and subsequent utilization of these resources are often hindered by sociocultural, economic, and institutional factors. This article explores actions taken by victims, available support services, and barriers to the utilization of available IPV resources by pregnant women in rural Nyanza, Kenya. Qualitative data were collected through nine focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews with pregnant women, partners or male relatives of pregnant women, and service providers. Data were managed in NVivo 8 using a descriptive analytical approach that harnessed thematic content coding and in-depth grounded analysis. We found that while formal resources for IPV were scarce, women utilized many informal resources (family, pastors, local leaders) as well as the health facility. In rare occasions, women escalated their response to formal services (police, judiciary). The community was sometimes responsive to women experiencing IPV but often viewed it as a "normal" part of local culture. Further barriers to women accessing services included logistical challenges and providers who were undertrained or uncommitted to responding to IPV appropriately. Moreover, the very sanctions meant to address violence (such as fines or jail) were often inhibiting for women who depended on their partners for financial resources. The results suggest that future IPV interventions should address community views around IPV and build upon locally available resources-including the health clinic-to address violence among women of childbearing age.

Abstract: Gender-based power imbalances are perhaps the most compelling underlying explanation for intimate partner violence (IPV) among women in sub-Saharan Africa. However, an overemphasis on female victimization results in an incomplete understanding of men's experiences as victims and the broader dyadic context in which violence occurs. This study examines the role of three domains of relationship power (power resources, processes, and outcomes) on sexual and physical IPV victimization in a unique sample of 466 young couples from Malawi. Two power resources were studied, namely, income and education level. Power processes were captured with a measure of couple communication and collaboration called unity. Power outcomes included a measure of relationship dominance (male dominated or female-dominated/egalitarian). Multilevel logistic regression using the Actor Partner Interpersonal Model framework was used to test whether respondent and partner data were predictive of IPV. The findings show that unity and male dominance were salient power factors that influenced young people's risk for sexual IPV. Unity had a stronger protective effect on sexual IPV for women than for men. Involvement in a male-dominated relationship increased the risk of sexual IPV for women, but decreased the risk for men. The findings also showed that education level and unity were protective against physical IPV for both men and women. Contrary to what was expected, partner data did not play a role in the respondent's experience of IPV. The consistency of these findings with the literature, theory, and study limitations are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Abstract: Research about the association between early marriage and intimate partner violence (IPV) in low-income countries has yielded conflicting evidence. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of and associations between early marriage, and IPV among adolescents and young adults in Viet Nam. Secondary analysis of data from the national Survey Assessment of Viet Namese Youth-Round II (SAVY-II) conducted in 2009-2010, which assessed a representative cohort of people aged 14 to 25 years recruited via a systematic household survey was undertaken. Prevalence was established using descriptive statistics. The association between early marriage and IPV was examined using multiple logistic regressions, adjusting for potential risk factors. Of 10,044 participants, 1,701 had ever married and were included in analyses. Early marriage (before age 18), and experiences of verbal, physical, or sexual IPV were more common among females than males. More young married men than women reported experiences of controlling behaviors by their partners. Early marriage, being illiterate, and exposure to sexual abuse were associated with experience of IPV among young females, but not among young males. Poverty and exposure to family violence was associated with IPV in both sexes. Addressing early marriage, low educational opportunities for girls, childhood sexual abuse, family violence, and poverty should be considered in strategies to reduce IPV in Viet Nam.

Intimate Partner Violence and Utilization of Prenatal Care in the United States

Author: Cha, Susan1; Masho, Saba W1 Virginia Commonwealth University, VA, Richmond, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520315249?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over 1.5 million women are victims of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse by former or present intimate partners. Intimate partner violence (IPV) around pregnancy can lead to devastating health consequences to mothers and infants. While some research suggests that IPV negatively affects the utilization of health services like prenatal care (PNC), inconsistencies in the assessment of PNC utilization, timing of partner violence, and definitions of IPV yield conflicting results. The objective for the present study is to evaluate whether preconception IPV, prenatal IPV, or IPV in the preconception and/or prenatal period affects PNC utilization. This study analyzed the 2004-2008 national Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), which included 202,367 women who delivered a live birth in the United States. IPV victimization was measured using four items that addressed physical abuse by a current or former husband/partner in the 12 months before (preconception) and during (prenatal) pregnancy. Responses were categorized as preconception, prenatal, and preconception and/or prenatal IPV. The outcome was PNC adequacy categorized as inadequate, intermediate, adequate, and adequate plus based on the Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization index. Separate logistic regression models provided crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Over 6% of women reported preconception and/or prenatal IPV and 26% had less than adequate PNC. Women who reported abuse before and/or during pregnancy were more likely to have inadequate PNC (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4, 95% CI = [1.3, 1.6]). Similarly, women who experienced preconception or prenatal IPV were 30% more likely to have inadequate PNC (OR = 1.3, 95% CI = [1.2, 1.5]; OR = 1.3, 95% CI = [1.1, 1.7], respectively). Adequate PNC is essential in improving pregnancy outcomes; however, women in abusive relationships may face ongoing challenges and difficulties with obtaining appropriate care. Findings underscore a critical problem and health providers are urged to screen and educate women about IPV during all preconception and prenatal visits.

Intimate Partner Violence Reported by Two Samples of Deaf Adults via a Computerized American Sign Language Survey

Author: Pollard, Robert Q1; Sutter, Erika; Cerulli, Catherine1 University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, NY, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520313584?accountid=14925

Abstract: A computerized sign language survey was administered to two large samples of deaf adults. Six questions regarding intimate partner violence (IPV) were included, querying lifetime and past-year experiences of emotional abuse, physical abuse, and forced sex. Comparison data were available from a telephone survey of local households. Deaf respondents reported high rates of emotional abuse and much higher rates of forced sex than general population respondents. Physical abuse rates were comparable between groups. More men than women in both deaf samples reported past-year physical and sexual abuse. Past-year IPV was associated with higher utilization of hospital emergency services. Implications for IPV research, education, and intervention in the Deaf community are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Parental Punishment and Peer Victimization as Developmental Precursors to Physical Dating Violence Involvement Among Girls

Author: Hipwell, Alison E1; Stepp, Stephanie D; Xiong, Shuangyan; Keenan, Kate; Blokland, Arjan; Loeber, Rolf1 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520331300?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study examined harsh punishment and peer victimization as developmental precursors to girls' involvement in physical dating violence (PDV) and the putative mediating effect of rejection sensitivity. The sample comprised 475 African-American and European-American participants of the longitudinal Pittsburgh Girls Study who were dating at age 17. About 10% of girls reported significant perpetration or victimization of physical aggression in the relationship. Results showed that initial level and escalation in harsh punishment (between 10 and 13 years) and escalation in peer victimization (10-15 years) predicted PDV involvement, but this relationship was not mediated by rejection sensitivity. The results highlight the need to consider the impact of early experience of different forms of aggression on girls' risk of PDV involvement. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate partner violence against female sex workers in Mombasa, Kenya

Author: Pack, Allison P1; L'Engle, Kelly; Mwarogo, Peter; Kingola, Nzioki1 FHI 360, Durham, North Carolina, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1559007101?accountid=14925

Abstract: Female sex workers are known to be at risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) from numerous sources including clients, pimps, boyfriends and husbands. Better understanding the factors associated with IPV in this population will enhance prevention efforts. This work examines baseline survey data collected as part of a randomised controlled trial for an alcohol-harm reduction intervention. The study sample included 619 sex workers. IPV was common in this sample, with 78.7% of women reporting any IPV in the last 30 days. Multivariate logistic regression results indicated that supporting one to two other people, experiencing child abuse, witnessing mother abuse, and greater alcohol consumption were risk factors for IPV in our sample. Women who frequented Population, Health and Integrated Assistance (APHIA) II drop-in centres located along transport corridors were also at greater risk of recent IPV, as compared with those who frequented other drop-in centres. Only one protective effect was identified in this study: condom use at last sex with a non-paying partner was associated with less recent IPV. Health programmes for women sex workers in Mombasa and elsewhere need to expand beyond HIV prevention -- they need to incorporate information on violence prevention and treatment referrals, as well as information on alcohol harm reduction. Adapted from the source document.

Policing Juveniles: Domestic Violence Arrest Policies, Gender, and Police Response to Child-Parent Violence

Author: Strom, Kevin J1; Warner, Tara D; Tichavsky, Lisa; Zahn, Margaret A1 RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1531934018?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study analyzed the National Incident Based Reporting System data from 2000 to 2004 to determine how domestic violence arrest policies, along with incident, offender, and victim characteristics, influence arrest outcomes in violent incidents committed by juveniles against their parents. The authors' primary interest was to assess whether the enforcement of domestic violence arrest laws, coupled with increased police involvement in familial disputes, has contributed to the decreasing gender gap in juvenile arrests for violent offenses. Results indicated that domestic violence arrest policies had positive effects on arrest outcomes both for juvenile females and males accused of assaulting a parent, as juveniles were more likely to be arrested in states with mandatory or pro-arrest policies than in states with discretionary arrest policies. However, there was also evidence that, beyond the effects of the domestic arrest laws, girls became increasingly more likely to be arrested for assaults against parents over the 5-year study period relative to boys. The implications for these findings are discussed, including the importance of a better understanding of how police respond to domestic violence incidents involving juveniles.

Personality Traits are Related to Intimate Partner Violence Among Securely Attached Individuals

Author: Buck, Nicole Maria Leonarda1; Leenaars, Petronella Engelina Maria; Emmelkamp, Paul Maria Gerardus; Marle, Hjalmar Johan Carel1 Forensic Psychiatric Center De Kijvelanden, PO 900, 3160, AC, Rhoon, The Netherlands, nmlbuck@gmail.com

Abstract: The general assumption has been that male batterers from clinical samples were mostly insecurely attached as compared to non-batterers. Recently, a large group was found (39.4 % of batterers in a clinical sample) whose main attachment style was secure. No previous studies have examined specifically the securely attached batterer. The aim of the present study was to test whether antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), but not borderline personality disorder (BPD), traits may be related to battering among securely attached individuals. Twenty-seven securely attached batterers, 45 insecurely attached batterers, 40 securely attached controls, and 22 insecurely attached controls who lived in the Netherlands, filled in self-report measures of personality disorder traits (i.e., antisocial, narcissism, borderline) and attachment (i.e., avoidant and anxious). Results showed that ASPD traits explained 19 % of the variance of battering in securely attached individuals. NPD and BPD traits are related to battering among securely attached individuals when NPD and BPD traits were entered alone in the equation.

The Role of Family Violence on Mental Health and Hopefulness in an Iranian Adolescents Sample

Author: Khodarahimi, Siamak11 Psychology Department, Eghlid Branch, Islamic Azad University, Eghlid, Iran khodarahimi@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1542002302?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between family violence and both mental health and hope. It was also designed to investigate the roles of gender and ethnicity on these constructs in an Iranian context. Participants included 300 adolescents from Eghid City, Fars Province, Iran selected through systematic random sampling within a survey design. A demographic questionnaire and three inventories were administered. Results indicated significant correlation coefficients between family violence, mental health, and hope. Males in general had a greater childhood history of physical assault and neglect, and experienced more overall family violence compared to females. Females showed higher psychopathology, including somatic complaints, anxiety/insomnia, social dysfunction, and depression. Ethnicity also played a significant role in nonviolent discipline and psychological aggression toward children. Adapted from the source document.

Victims of Intimate Partner Violence. The Physician's Intervention in the Portuguese National Health Service

Author: Martins, Helena1; Assuncao, Lino; Caldas, Ines Morais; Magalhaes, Teresa1 Biomedical Sciences Institute 'Abel Salazar', University of Porto, Porto, Portugal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541997497?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study intends to characterize the current situation in Portugal regarding intimate partner violence (IPV) disclosure by the victims and its detection and report by the National Health Service (NHS) professionals, in order to promote the health and protection of the former. We interviewed 101 adult victims of IPV who sought care in the NHS. The results reveal that a relevant number of victims did not disclose the abuse to NHS physicians (18.8 %). According to the victims, in 57.9 % of the cases, physicians did not suspect IPV. In cases where there actually was suspicion (based on specific evidence and markers) or where there was no concealment of such type of violence, 52.3 % of the physicians did not inform the victims about the risks this situation posed to them, 89.8 % did not mention their obligation to denounce the case (as it is foreseen by the Portuguese law), and the number of injuries they described was lower than the one described in the forensic medical reports. Adapted from the source document.

Protecting Rural Church-Going Immigrant Women from Family Violence

Author: Hancock, Tina U1; Ames, Natalie; Behnke, Andrew O1 New Mexico State University, PO Box 30001, MSC 3SW, Las Cruces, NM, 88003, USA, thancock@nmsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1522051175?accountid=14925

Abstract: Rural Latino immigrant women at risk of family violence may perceive churches as their only source of help. However, immigrant church leaders may be poorly equipped to address family violence in their congregations. This article describes a project designed to stimulate and support appropriate responses to family violence by rural immigrant churches, including those identified with conservative theological views on women. The primary goal was to provide rural Latino church leaders with culturally sensitive materials and resources they were willing to use with their congregations. We collaborated with local service providers who assisted in recruiting the church leaders for the pastors' workshops where the resource materials were presented. Survey data indicated most of the pastors were receptive to the content and planned to incorporate it into their church work. Suggestions are made for future research on this culturally sensitive approach to addressing family violence in the immigrant community.

Intimate Partner Violence against Women in Turkey: A Synthesis of the Literature

Author: Guvenc, Gulten1; Akyuz, Aygul; Cesario, Sandra K1 School of Nursing, Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey guvencgulden@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1542002493?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence against women is a serious abuse of human rights and an important public health problem that concerns all sectors of society worldwide. The objective of this study was to critically review and synthesize original research published between 2000 and 2010 focused on examining intimate partner violence (IPV) against women in Turkey. Several research databases were searched for journal articles published in English or Turkish and a total of 21 studies were identified for inclusion and further analysis. The present literature review revealed the ratio of IPV in Turkey reported by different studies ranged from 13 to 78 %. Results of this review emphasize that violence against women is an important issue in Turkey. Gathering data on the prevalence of IPV can serve to raise awareness on violence and provide baseline information for developing more effective preventive policies and programs. Adapted from the source document.

Preliminary Investigation of the Roles of Military Background and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms in Frequency and Recidivism of Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration Among Court-Referred Men

Author: Hoyt, Tim1; Wray, Alisha M; Rielage, Jennifer Klosterman1 Madigan Army Medical Center-Tacoma, WA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1506813476?accountid=14925

Abstract: Significant rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration have been identified among men with military backgrounds. Research indicates posttraumatic stress symptoms place military men at increased risk for IPV perpetration, but may be negatively associated with IPV among nonmilitary samples. However, no previous studies have directly compared court-referred IPV offenders with and without military experience, which may have clinical implications if posttraumatic stress symptoms are differentially associated with IPV perpetration across these two samples. Twenty court-referred IPV offenders with military background were demographically matched with 40 court-referred IPV offenders without military background. As anticipated, self- and partner-report of physically assaultive acts and injurious acts during baseline assessment showed significantly greater physical assault and injury perpetrated by offenders with military background. However, 1-year follow-up data on convictions indicated a significantly lower rate of recidivism among offenders with military background than among nonmilitary offenders. As hypothesized, symptoms of posttraumatic stress at intake showed a significant positive correlation with IPV perpetration among offenders with military background; however, this relationship showed a negative correlation among offenders without military background. Clinical implications are discussed including treatment avenues, such as Veterans Courts and other incarceration diversion programs, which may be particularly appropriate for offenders with military backgrounds.

Longitudinal Association of Suicidal Ideation and Physical Dating Violence among High School Students

Author: Nahapetyan, Lusine1; Orpinas, Pamela; Song, Xiao; Holland, Kristin1 Department Health Promotion and Behavior, College of Public Health, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA lusine@uga.edu

Abstract: Two salient problems in adolescent development are dating violence and suicidal ideation. Theory and empirical research have supported their association in primarily cross-sectional studies. The purpose of this study is to examine the longitudinal association between physical dating violence and suicidal ideation (thoughts or plans) in a cohort of students evaluated annually from Grades 9 to 12. The sample consisted of 556 random-selected students (50.2 % males; 47.5 % White, 37.8 % Black, 11.2 % Latino) who reported dating at least once during the four assessments. Self-reported frequency of suicidal ideation, dating, and physical dating violence perpetration and victimization were assessed each spring from ninth to twelfth grade. We used generalized estimating equations modeling to predict the effects of sex, race, school grade, and physical dating perpetration and victimization on suicidal ideation. Cumulatively, one-fourth of the sample reported suicidal ideation at least once by the end of Grade 12, and approximately half reported physical dating violence. Female gender (OR = 1.7, p = 0.02), physical dating perpetration (OR = 1.54, p = 0.048), physical dating victimization (OR = 2.03, p < 0.001), and being in grades 9-11 versus 12 in high school (OR = 1.83, p = 0.004) were significant predictors of suicidal ideation. Race was not a significant predictor among adolescents in this sample. This longitudinal study highlights the detrimental emotional effect of physical dating violence perpetration and victimization among high school students. It is important that suicide prevention programs incorporate physical dating violence education and prevention strategies starting early in high school. Adapted from the source document.

Physical Intimate Partner Violence in Northern India

Author: Ragavan, Maya I1; Iyengar, Kirti; Wurtz, Rebecca M1 Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1542000451?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article, we examine perceptions about the definition of physical intimate partner violence (IPV) in northern India utilizing feminist perspectives as a framework. We interviewed 56 women and 52 men affiliated with a health services nongovernmental organization in the Udaipur district of Rajasthan. We transcribed, coded, and analyzed the interviews utilizing grounded theory. We found that perceptions regarding physical IPV were associated with both structural and ideological patriarchal beliefs and microlevel constructs such as alcohol use. We discovered multiple types of physical IPV in the study region, including rationalized violence (socially condoned violence perpetrated by a husband against his wife), unjustified violence (socially prohibited violence perpetrated by a husband against his wife), and majboori violence (violence perpetrated by a wife against her husband). Our results add to the breadth of research available about IPV in India and create a framework for future research and IPV prevention initiatives.

Male Victims of Intimate Partner Abuse: Use and Helpfulness of Services

Author: Tsui, Venus

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541997539?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data obtained from a national study of male victims or survivors of intimate partner abuse (IPA) indicate that the experience (current or past) of abuse and with service use may predict a positive perception toward help seeking. However, marital status and a tendency to minimize problems may predict negative attitudes toward help seeking. Empirical evidence from this mixed-method study suggests that male victims face many interpersonal and societal obstacles. Feeling uncomfortable when requesting assistance, men in IPA situations are affected by a masking factor that causes them to hide their situation and contributes to a misconception factor that causes people to treat men as the sole perpetrator. Although men are eligible, services may not be perceived as being available or helpful. The study yields important implications for social work practice, and the findings result in several recommendations for increased awareness about IPA, advocacy for gender-inclusive services, revision of laws and policies, increased research, and emphasis on funded and anonymous services. Adapted from the source document.

An Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Protocol Readiness Model

Author: Daire, Andrew P1; Carlson, Ryan G; Barden, Sejal M; Jacobson, Lamerial1 Department of Educational and Human Sciences, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA andrew.daire@ucf.edu

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a widespread, pervasive issue that affects heterosexual and same-sex relationships. However, IPV is largely underreported, and many counselors do not formally assess for relationship violence. Additionally, counselors typically do not have a plan to manage disclosures of violence when they occur. We present an IPV Protocol Readiness Model that helps counselors determine their readiness to assess for IPV as well as manage disclosures. Additionally, we present a questionnaire intended to provide guidance for counselors regarding organizational and community factors important to the success of an IPV protocol. Finally, we discuss practical applications and suggestions for further research. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

An equality bargaining breakthrough: Paid domestic violence leave

Author: Baird, Marian; McFerran, Ludo; Wright, Ingrid

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1542002420?accountid=14925

Abstract: In 2010, the first clauses providing paid leave and other entitlements to victims of domestic violence were included in union negotiated enterprise agreements registered with the Australian Fair Work Commission. By mid-2013, over one hundred enterprise agreements in Australia included such a clause. Applying a model of 'equality bargaining', this article presents a case study of the development and negotiation of one of the first domestic violence clauses providing paid leave in the world. The analysis finds key facilitators of equality bargaining in this case were the contributions from external forces, the availability of a 'model clause' and the commitment of The Union's representatives. Of lesser significance, but still apparent, was the bargaining relationship and the reputation of the parties. Contrary to the findings in other research, neither the decentralised bargaining framework nor the absence of a supportive legislative framework was an impediment to successful bargaining of the domestic violence clause in this case.

Multi-Perpetrator Domestic Violence

Author: Salter, Michael11 School of Social Science and Psychology, University of Western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia michael.salter@uws.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1531928799?accountid=14925

Abstract: A significant proportion of reports of domestic violence against women involve multiple perpetrators. Although the number of perpetrators has been consistently identified as a measure of abuse severity, only a minority of studies of domestic violence examine the role of multiple offenders. Data on multi-perpetrator domestic violence (MDV) is frequently removed from analysis in domestic violence studies, or multi-perpetrator incidents are treated as single-perpetrator incidents. However, the available research links MDV to negative mental and physical health outcomes, intimate partner homicide, homelessness among women, and severe mental illness and suicidality. This article reviews the available prevalence data on MDV and draws together research on the contexts in which MDV takes place. It highlights two groups that are particularly vulnerable to MDV: (1) girls and women partnered to members of gangs and organized crime groups and (2) girls and women in some ethnic minority communities. While discussions of honor in relation to domestic violence are often racialized in Western media, this article highlights the cross-cultural role of masculine honor in collective violence against women in the working class and impoverished communities of majority cultures as well as in migrant and ethnic minority communities. It is clear that such complex forms of violence present a range of challenges for intervention and treatment and the article emphasizes the need for specialized and coordinated modes of investigation, support, and care.

Genetic Associations With Intimate Partner Violence in a Sample of Hazardous Drinking Men in Batterer Intervention Programs

Author: Stuart, Gregory L1; McGeary, John E; Shorey, Ryan C; Knopik, Valerie S; Beaucage, Kayla; Temple, Jeff R1 University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1524522013?accountid=14925

Abstract: The etiology of intimate partner violence (IPV) is multifactorial. However, etiological theories of IPV have rarely included potential genetic factors. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether a cumulative genetic score (CGS) containing the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and the human serotonin transporter gene linked polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) was associated with IPV perpetration after accounting for the effects of alcohol problems, drug problems, age, and length of relationship. We obtained DNA from 97 men in batterer intervention programs in the state of Rhode Island. In the full sample, the CGS was significantly associated with physical and psychological aggression and injuries caused to one's partner, even after controlling for the effects of alcohol problems, drug problems, age, and length of relationship. Two of the men in the sample likely had Klinefelter's syndrome, and analyses were repeated excluding these two individuals, leading to similar results. The implications of the genetic findings for the etiology and treatment of IPV among men in batterer intervention programs are briefly discussed.

Responsible Integration of Biological and Psychosocial Models: Comments on 'Genetic Associations With Intimate Partner Violence in a Sample of Hazardous Drinking Men in Batterer Intervention Programs'

Author: Abbey, Antonia11 Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541996029?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite research demonstrating that gene expression differs in response to social environmental circumstances, deterministic views of biology are common. Stuart and colleagues (2014) encourage readers to think about genetic factors in the same dynamic and probabilistic manner that they consider other causes of intimate partner violence. Given that participants had co-occurring alcohol problems, future studies should evaluate how different genetic polymorphisms uniquely and synergistically contribute to heavy drinking and aggression under different socio-environmental conditions. Psychological expectancies have a powerful impact on behavior, thus extreme caution is required before labeling people as genetically predisposed to violence.

A New Piece to Understanding the Intimate Partner Violence Puzzle: What Role Do Genetics Play?

Author: DeWall, C Nathan1; Way, Baldwin M1 University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541996054?accountid=14925

Abstract: Numerous factors prompt intimate partner violence (IPV). Stuart and colleagues examined whether variations in two theoretically relevant genetic variants predispose some people toward perpetrating psychological aggression, physical aggression, and violence that causes the victim serious physical injury. This commentary discusses the importance of considering how the observed genetic risk factors for IPV may be best understood within the context of their interaction with environmental risk factors. By focusing on gene-environment interactions, future work may help identify not only who is at risk for IPV perpetration but also who may be buffered from it.

Abstract: We thank Drs. Abbey, Bennett, DeWall, and Way for making truly outstanding points in their thoughtful commentaries. We agree with the feedback and advice from all of these distinguished scientists. Future work on genetics and intimate partner violence (IPV) should, when possible, include a larger number of genetic variants, closely examine gene by environment interactions, and study potential mechanisms explaining the connection between genetics and IPV. As with any research, but particularly with respect to studies on a controversial topic such as genetic correlates of IPV, extreme caution should be taken prior to generalizing results or deriving any practical applications from the data. Clearly, replication and extension of the findings in other populations is essential. Ultimately, we believe that it is worth pursuing this line of work given the possible contributions it may make to understanding the etiology, prevention, and treatment of IPV in the future. Finding solutions to IPV will require the collaboration of a diverse group of constituents from many disciplines. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Sexual Orientation and the Effects of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Koeppel, Maria D H1; Bouffard, Leana A1 College of Criminal Justice, Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, Texas, USA mkoeppel@shsu.edu

Abstract: Studies have demonstrated a relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and depression and other mental health issues such as suicidal behavior and posttraumatic stress disorder. Despite the breadth of the literature, there is a dearth of information specifically regarding the effects of IPV in same-sex relationships. Information regarding the prevalence of substance abuse and health issues in non-heterosexual IPV victims when compared to heterosexual IPV victims will be extremely helpful in developing tailored victim services to sexual minorities. This study uses the National Violence Against Women Survey to examine hypothesized relationships between IPV, its effects, and sexual orientation. Given the higher prevalence rates of IPV in same-sex relationships (Messinger, 2011), logistic regression models are used to test the hypotheses that non-heterosexual victims of IPV will have higher rates of depression, substance use, and health issues.

Problematic Conjugations: Women's Agency, Marriage and Domestic Violence in Indonesia

Author: Aisyah, Siti1; Parker, Lyn1 Universitas Islam Negeri Alauddin Makassar

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1551000477?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examines women's experience of domestic violence within marriage in Makassar, South Sulawesi. It analyses the meaning of marriage for men and women, the roles of men and women within marriage, shifts in marriage practices -- particularly the shift from arranged to 'love' marriage -- and unequal gender positions within marriage. We discuss some salient issues in the 'margins of marriage' in Indonesia: polygyny and constructions of masculinity that condone the practice of polygyny/affairs, and attitudes towards divorce, particularly for women. We then examine women's perception of the causes and triggers of domestic violence as revealed by fieldwork data, using the lens of women's agency. Our findings are that women perceive that their expressions of agency -- for instance in challenging men's authority, moral righteousness and adequacy as breadwinners -- are the most common triggers for male violence within marriage. Finally, we discuss the difficulty for women of escaping domestic violence, thereby getting some purchase on the relative capacity of women to resist, deflect or deal with the violence.

Domestic violence made public: a case study of the use of alternative dispute resolution among underprivileged women in Bangladesh

Author: Ashrafun, Laila1; Saavala, Minna1 Department of Social Research, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1551001759?accountid=14925

Abstract: Disputes within the family and cases of domestic violence in Bangladesh have traditionally been resolved either among kinsmen or in village panchayats where young women have had less opportunity to be heard. This article describes a third-sector initiative in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in cases of domestic violence in Sylhet, Bangladesh. Data from 20 case studies of female victims of domestic violence, interviews with six lawyers, and participant observation in 10 mediations in a counselling centre are used to examine how this kind of social innovation affects the bargaining position of battered women in a kin-based, patrilineal and patrilocal society. The battered women involved in these mediations were rural or urban, less educated, and economically disadvantaged. The findings illustrate the limitations of ADR in cases of domestic violence. ADR as practiced in Sylhet, Bangladesh provides poor women a chance to be publicly heard in mediations of their domestic crises. However, ADR often fails to deliver lasting, just, and socially progressive solutions. The adoption of ADR practices should not be considered as an alternative to the development of the formal judicial system, because it lacks the power to enforce agreements and supports the hegemonic status quo, leaving the battered woman and her natal family with very limited options. Adapted from the source document.

Experiences of Health and Health Care Among Women Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence: Qualitative Findings From Germany

Author: Larsen, Mandi M1; Krohn, Julia; Puschel, Klaus; Seifert, Dragana1 Institute for Legal Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1559005360?accountid=14925

Abstract: Through qualitative interviews with six female survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Germany, we explored their experiences with health and health care within the context of a universal access health system. Using phenomenological analysis, we learned that they view violence as a burden on health; expect health professionals to acknowledge the link between IPV and health with empathy; and experience barriers to acute mental health services despite a lack of financial barriers in seeking treatment. We discuss how our findings compare with other international research, as well as the implications for the health care system's response to IPV. Adapted from the source document.

The Wakanheza Project: A Public Health Approach to Primary Prevention of Family Violence

Author: Erickson, Christina L1; Gault, Donald; Simmons, Darleen1 Department of Social Work, Augsburg College, Minneapolis, MN, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1567046080?accountid=14925

Abstract: Family violence is a well-documented phenomenon. The Wakanheza Project, grounded in the prevention principles of public health, is a community-based violence prevention initiative designed to reduce harsh treatment of children in public. The Wakanheza Project is not a program or curriculum. It uses principles that involve individuals and organizations in learning sessions to rethink why challenging situations occur and ways to ameliorate these challenges. Qualitative research methods explore the impact on 3 diverse organizations in an urban county. Ideas for replication and research toward the primary prevention of violence are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Financial Literacy and Economic Empowerment of Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence: Examining the Differences Between Public Assistance Recipients and Nonrecipients

Author: Hetling, Andrea1; Postmus, Judy1 Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1550996598?accountid=14925

Abstract: Financial literacy helps build economic empowerment and self-sufficiency among economically vulnerable groups. This article explores the effect of financial literacy on the economic empowerment of survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) and investigates whether the relationship might differ for women receiving public assistance. Using survey data from 120 survivors of IPV, regression models examine the direct and interactive effects of financial literacy and public assistance receipt. Findings indicate that though being a public assistance recipient seems to be related to higher levels of economic empowerment, this effect disappears when controlling for financial literacy levels and their interaction with benefit status. Adapted from the source document.

Cultural Factors in the Treatment of Battered Women With Privilege: Domestic Violence in the Lives of White European-American, Middle-Class, Heterosexual Women

Author: Berg, Kathryn K11 Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA berg.kathrynk@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541997614?accountid=14925

Abstract: The field of social work pathologizes marginalized cultures by neglecting to explicitly identify cultural factors in the lives of women with systemic privilege due to race, class, and sexual orientation. This article discusses the importance of examining privilege as a strategy for advancing cultural competency in the treatment of battered women. Cultural factors in the lives of White European-American, middle-class, heterosexual women in intimate partnerships with men who share their privileges, referred to as 'dominant culture women,' are explored. Additional scholarship which identifies cultural factors placing this population at risk is needed to advance cultural competency in domestic violence interventions.

'He didn't mean to hit mom, I think': positioning, agency and point in adolescents' narratives about domestic violence

Author: Overlien, Carolina11 Researcher, Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies (NKVTS), Oslo, Norway.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520318954?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper analyses the narratives of adolescents who have experienced domestic violence. It focuses on what we can learn about being an adolescent who experiences domestic violence, using a narrative approach. Attentive to both form and content, the paper sheds light on why the narrative is being told, who the actors in the narratives are, who are positioned in the forefront/background and what the point of the narrative is. The analysis shows that through the storytelling, the father's position as the reluctant/dangerous/weak aggressor is negotiated, the mother is positioned both in the background as a victim and in the forefront as an actor resisting his violent behaviour. The children position themselves as actors with power to alter the progress, to protect and stop the violence. The point of the narratives is to describe the father as the aggressor, and to describe the important role of the children. This picture of the father, mother and child questions the traditional understanding of the father as the aggressor, the mother as the victim and the child as a powerless bystander being exposed to the violence, and underlines the complexities of the dynamics in families living with domestic violence.

Descriptions of fathers' care by children exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) -- relative neglect and children's needs

Author: Cater, Asa1; Forssell, Anna M1 School of Law, Psychology and Social work, Orebro University, Orebro, Sweden.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520323920?accountid=14925

Abstract: The situation of children exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) raises certain issues related to child neglect. Little is known about how children exposed to IPV perceive and describe their living conditions. This paper addresses this lack by analysing aspects of fathers' care in descriptions given by children whose fathers have subjected the mothers to IPV. The analysis is based on qualitative interviews with 10 children aged 8-12 years. Three themes constitute the results. First, the fathers are not described by the children as engaged and responsible care providers. Second, in their general descriptions of how mothers and fathers fill complementary roles for the child, parenthood seems to mean in practice that the mother is the provider of (almost) everything the child may need. Third, the mere absence of violence seems to be judged 'good-enough' fathering in the children's descriptions. Altogether, this leads to the conclusion that being exposed to IPV and believing that mothers are responsible for their welfare precludes children from viewing their fathers as responsible for their well-being. The limited utility for child welfare practice of a 'child-based' definition of neglect in cases of IPV is discussed, and alternatives are suggested. Adapted from the source document.

Predetermined participation: Social workers evaluating children's agency in domestic violence interventions

Author: Iversen, Clara11 Uppsala University, Sweden

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1551001301?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines how ideals of children's participation and model consistency compete in social workers' accounts of intervention outcomes in 35 evaluation interviews in Sweden. Using discursive psychology, the analysis demonstrates how the social workers rely on category-based accounts: They describe willing children as competent, unwilling children as developing, and children attempting to rule in counselling as problematic. The interviews' focus on following the intervention model constructs a limited, predetermined participation that only respects children's wishes when they agree with the intervention. In showing this, the study contributes to further understanding of tensions between the principle and practice of participation.

Detecting Domestic Violence: Italian Validation of Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS-2)

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health problem that requires valid assessment tools. The aim of the study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS-2) in a sample of 209 women (143 from the general population and 66 IPV victims). Based on factor analysis, five subscales were proposed, partially corresponding to the original scales: negotiation, violence, extreme violence, injury, and sexual coercion. The reliability of the subscales was good, ranging from 0.78 to 0.96. The discriminant capacity of the scores was assessed comparing victims versus non-abused women, and extreme violence correlated positively with depression, injury and negotiation but negatively with alexithymia. These results indicate that the Italian version of CTS-2 scale can be recommended for use in research and clinical programs. Adapted from the source document.

What Can be Done About High-Risk Perpetrators of Domestic Violence?

Author: Juodis, Marcus1; Starzomski, Andrew; Porter, Stephen; Woodworth, Michael1 Psychology Department, Dalhousie University, Life Sciences Centre, 1355 Oxford Street, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, B3H 4R2

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1567046996?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article addresses practical implications for preventing lethal and nonlethal domestic violence (DV) that stem from recent research on male domestic homicide perpetrators. The role of risk assessment and batterer intervention programs is emphasized, including specific programming for treatment-resistant perpetrators. Adjunct interventions for related problems (e.g., anger, suicidal behaviour, substance abuse) are offered, and risk management tactics are summarized. The article highlights the significance of safety planning for victims and teaching youth skills for forming and maintaining healthy relationships. Possible solutions to the problem of DV perpetrators who avoid arrest also are highlighted (e.g., public awareness campaigns). Additionally, this article discusses approaches for dealing with psychopathic DV perpetrators, including the possible benefits of community education on psychopathy and early intervention for youth at risk for developing these traits. Some policy implications concerning DV and psychopathy also are covered. The article underscores the importance of coordinated community responses to DV. Adapted from the source document.

Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence and Its Impact on Health: Female and Male Patients Using a Free Clinic

Author: Kamimura, Akiko; Christensen, Nancy; Tabler, Jennifer; Ashby, Jeanie; Olson, Lenora M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1550996793?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to examine the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) with physical and mental health indicators among free clinic patients. A cross-sectional study conducted via self-administered surveys. English and Spanish-speaking women and men aged 18 to 64 years responded to standardized questionnaires regarding IPV, physical and mental health, depression, and emotional support. The overall prevalence of IPV was 41%. The US-born participants reported a higher prevalence of IPV (women=61% and men=69%) compared with the national average (women=36% and men=29%) and the non-US-born or immigrant participants (women=39% and men=7%). Women with IPV reported poorer mental health but the same level of physical health functioning compared with women without IPV. The impact of IPV on health was somewhat different for men. In conclusion, IPV is associated with poor health outcomes, especially for US-born participants. Further research is warranted to understand causal mechanisms and to aid patients. Adapted from the source document.

Child Abuse in the Context of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women: The Impact of Women's Depressive and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms on Maternal Behavior

Author: Boeckel, Mariana G1; Blasco-Ros, Concepcion; Grassi-Oliveira, Rodrigo; Martinez, Manuela1 Pontifical Catholic University, Porto Alegre, Brazil

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541997567?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate male partner violence against women has been recognized as an important public health problem, with a high impact on women's mental health, including depressive and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. However, fathers who have been involved in intimate partner violence (IPV) have an increased probability of being violent toward their children. The aim of this study was to assess the relation between the mental health status of abused women, their partner's violence toward the children, and their maternal behavior.

Understanding Child Maltreatment in Hanoi: Intimate Partner Violence, Low Self-Control, and Social and Child Care Support

Author: Emery, Clifton R1; Nguyen, Hai Trung; Kim, Jaeyop1 Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea, Tsinghua University, Seoul, South Korea

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541999991?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study aimed to understand the role of low self-control, stress, depression, experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) and child abuse, and social support and child care support in the etiology of child abuse and neglect in Hanoi, Vietnam. The study estimated the prevalence of child maltreatment in a randomly selected, representative cluster sample of 269 Hanoi families. Among these families, 21% reported severe abuse of their children in the past year, 12% reported neglect. Low self-control was found to be strongly associated with child abuse. Life stressors were found to be strongly associated with neglect, but only indirectly with child abuse. Counter-intuitively, a positive interaction between social support and low self-control was found, suggesting that social support of parents low in self-control is associated with more maltreatment. Implications for research, intervention, and criminological theory are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women on Under-Five Child Mortality in Bangladesh

Author: Hossain, MdAkhtar1; Sumi, Nahid Sultana; Haque, MErshadul; Bari, Wasimul1 University of Dhaka, Bangladesh

Abstract: It is well established that intimate partner violence (IPV) against women adversely affects maternal morbidity and mortality. But a limited number of studies were found in the literature regarding the association between IPV and under-five child mortality. In this article, using Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2007 data, we examined the effect of IPV on under-five child mortality. A product-limit approach was used for bivariate survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazard multiple regression models were used to investigate the effect of IPV controlling potential confounders. In bivariate analysis, the variables exposure to IPV, mother's age at birth, mother's education, residence type, division, number of children, wealth index, occupation, access to media, and decision autonomy were found to be potential risk factors for child mortality. Results indicated that women exposed to IPV were more likely to experience under-five child mortality compared with women not exposed. The unadjusted hazard ratio for IPV was 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.09, 1.35]) with p value < .01, whereas it was 1.16 (95% CI = [1.04, 1.29]) with p value < .01 and 1.13 (95% CI = [1.01, 1.26]) with p value < .05 in two adjusted models. These results implied that IPV against women is a problem not only for women but also for their children's survival.

Victims' Barriers to Discussing Domestic Violence in Clinical Consultations: A Qualitative Enquiry

Author: Othman, Sajaratulnisah1; Goddard, Chris; Piterman, Leon1 University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1531932326?accountid=14925

Abstract: Victims of domestic violence frequently attend health care facilities. In many cases, their abusive experience is neither disclosed nor discussed during clinical consultations. This study examined the barriers faced by women when discussing abuse with health care providers, specifically in cases involving Malaysian women with a history of domestic violence. A qualitative study using in-depth interviews was conducted with 10 women with a history of domestic violence residing at a shelter. Purposive sampling was conducted until data saturation. Using the grounded theory approach of analysis, themes that emerged from these interviews were then further analyzed to examine the barriers faced by these women. Women who experienced domestic violence faced multiple barriers while discussing their accounts of abuse with others. Values placed on the privacy of domestic violence; upholding the traditional gender roles; preserving the family unity; minimizing the abuse, the feeling of shame, self-blame; and fearing their abuser generally create internal barriers when discussing their encounters of abuse with health care providers. The perceived unknown role of health care professionals when dealing with patients experiencing domestic violence as well as the previous negative experiences in clinical consultations acted as external barriers for discussing abuse with health care providers. Women with domestic violence experiences faced internal and external barriers to discussing their abuse during clinical consultations. Physicians and health care providers must consider domestic violence in consultations with female patients. A good doctor-patient relationship that encompasses empathy, confidence, trust, support, assurance, confidentiality, and guidance can help patients with abusive backgrounds overcome these barriers, leading to the disclosure and discussion of their abusive encounters. Proper education, guidelines, and support for health care providers are required to help them assist women with histories of domestic violence.

Dating Violence Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth

Author: Dank, Meredith1; Lachman, Pamela; Zweig, Janine M; Yahner, Jennifer1 Urban Institute, Justice Policy Center, Washington, DC, USA, mdank@urban.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1516883190?accountid=14925

Abstract: Media attention and the literature on lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth overwhelmingly focus on violence involving hate crimes and bullying, while ignoring the fact that vulnerable youth also may be at increased risk of violence in their dating relationships. In this study, we examine physical, psychological, sexual, and cyber dating violence experiences among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth-as compared to those of heterosexual youth, and we explore variations in the likelihood of help-seeking behavior and the presence of particular risk factors among both types of dating violence victims. A total of 5,647 youth (51 % female, 74 % White) from 10 schools participated in a cross-sectional anonymous survey, of which 3,745 reported currently being in a dating relationship or having been in one during the prior year. Results indicated that lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth are at higher risk for all types of dating violence victimization (and nearly all types of dating violence perpetration), compared to heterosexual youth. Further, when looking at gender identity, transgender and female youth are at highest risk of most types of victimization, and are the most likely perpetrators of all forms of dating violence but sexual coercion, which begs further exploration. The findings support the development of dating violence prevention programs that specifically target the needs and vulnerabilities of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth, in addition to those of female and transgender youth.

Gay men and intimate partner violence: a gender analysis

Author: Oliffe, John L1; Han, Christina; Sta Maria, Estephanie; Lohan, Maria; Howard, Terry; Stewart, Donna E; MacMillan, Harriet1 School of Nursing. University of British Columbia

Abstract: Though intimate partner violence (IPV) is predominately understood as a women's health issue most often emerging within heterosexual relationships, there is increasing recognition of the existence of male victims of IPV. In this qualitative study we explored connections between masculinities and IPV among gay men. The findings show how recognising IPV was based on an array of participant experiences, including the emotional, physical and sexual abuse inflicted by their partner, which in turn led to three processes. Normalising and concealing violence referred to the participants' complicity in accepting violence as part of their relationship and their reluctance to disclose that they were victims of IPV. Realising a way out included the participants' understandings that the triggers for, and patterns of, IPV would best be quelled by leaving the relationship. Nurturing recovery detailed the strategies employed by participants to mend and sustain their wellbeing in the aftermath of leaving an abusive relationship. In terms of masculinities and men's health research, the findings reveal the limits of idealising hegemonic masculinities and gender relations as heterosexual, while highlighting a plurality of gay masculinities and the need for IPV support services that bridge the divide between male and female as well as between homosexual and heterosexual. Gay men and intimate partner violence. Adapted from the source document.

It's Not Just the Alcohol: Gender, Alcohol Use, and Intimate Partner Violence in Mae La Refugee Camp, Thailand, 2009

Author: Ezard, Nadine

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1531933251?accountid=14925

Abstract: Alcohol use is common in many conflict-displaced populations; population perspectives of alcohol use have not been well studied. Interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of 97 people (September-December 2009) in Mae La, a long-standing refugee camp on the Thai-Burma border, and analyzed thematically. Intimate partner violence (IPV) emerged as a prominent theme, with four subthemes: alcohol use is subject to strongly gendered social controls; alcohol use is changing under the pressures of displacement; IPV is an emergent alcohol-related harm; the relationship between IPV and alcohol is complex. The study's limitations are noted, and future practice and research directions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Risk Factors for Severe Intimate Partner Violence and Violence-Related Injuries Among Women in India

Author: Sabri, Bushra1; Renner, Lynette M; Stockman, Jamila K; Mittal, Mona; Decker, Michele R1 School of Nursing, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1551001320?accountid=14925

Abstract: Relying on an ecological framework, we examined risk factors for severe physical intimate partner violence (IPV) and related injuries among a nationally representative sample of women (N = 67,226) in India. Data for this cross-sectional study were derived from the 2005-2006 India National Family Health Survey, a nationally representative household-based health surveillance system. Logistic regression analyses were used to generate the study findings. We found that factors related to severe physical IPV and injuries included low or no education, low socioeconomic status, rural residence, greater number of children, and separated or divorced marital status. Husbands' problem drinking, jealousy, suspicion, control, and emotionally and sexually abusive behaviors were also related to an increased likelihood of women experiencing severe IPV and injuries. Other factors included women's exposure to domestic violence in childhood, perpetration of IPV, and adherence to social norms that accept husbands' violence. Practitioners may use these findings to identify women at high risk of being victimized by severe IPV or injuries for prevention and intervention strategies. Policies and programs that focus on empowering abused women and holding perpetrators accountable may protect women at risk for severe IPV or injuries that may result in death. Adapted from the source document.

Sexual Risk Factors Associated with Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Rwanda: A Couples-Based Analysis

Author: Kayibanda, Jeanne Francoise1; Bitera, Raphael; Demers, Eric; Moisan, Jocelyne; Alary, Michel1 Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Laval, Quebec, Quebec, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1551001370?accountid=14925

Abstract: The goal of this study was to measure the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) against women and to examine the independent association of sexual risk factors of women and their husbands/partners with IPV. We used data from 2,169 couples from the 2005 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey. Face-to-face interviews were conducted, and multiple logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 560 (29.2%), 415 (22.2%), and 233 (12.4%) women reported any physical, psychological, or sexual IPV, respectively. History of genital ulcer in women was significantly associated with psychological IPV (AOR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.67-4.59), whereas history of genital ulcer reported by husbands/partners was significantly associated with sexual IPV (AOR 2.80, 95% CI: 1.08-7.29). The number of lifetime sexual partners of husbands was positively associated with increasing odds of their wives being exposed to psychological IPV (p = 0.025) and physical IPV (p = .017). In a representative sample of couples, husbands/partners' sexual risk factors were associated with IPV reported by their wives. Genital ulcer appeared to be a risk marker for the presence of IPV victimization/perpetration. Adapted from the source document.

Savings for Survivors: An Individual Development Account Program for Survivors of Intimate-Partner Violence

Author: Sanders, Cynthia K

Abstract: Survivors of domestic violence often remain in abusive relationships due to limited economic resources, economic dependence on an abusive partner, and economic abuse. Viewing women who have experienced domestic violence as 'survivors' suggests that when provided access to appropriate resources, they will seek help and utilize such resources allowing them to increase their stability and potentially escape an abusive partner. Assets have been shown to have a variety of positive associations with a wide range of economic, social, and psychological outcomes. Economic initiatives, such as financial education and individual development accounts (IDAs), aimed toward survivors of domestic violence are on the rise. However, to date, there are few studies. Data on IDA activity, including savings rates, withdrawals, and asset purchases, for 125 women who participated in an IDA matched-savings program for survivors of intimate-partner violence were examined. Approximately 2/3 of women reached their savings goal and 76% made at least 1 matched-savings withdrawal and asset purchase. Results suggest survivors can be successful savers and purchase assets that may contribute to their economic stability. Implications are discussed, including the need for long-term studies to examine how participation in a matched-savings program affects women's well-being, safety, and future experiences of intimate-partner violence.

Enculturation and Attitudes Toward Intimate Partner Violence and Gender Roles in an Asian Indian Population: Implications for Community-Based Prevention

Author: Yoshihama, Mieko1; Blazevski, Juliane; Bybee, Deborah1 School of Social Work, University of Michigan, 1080 S. University, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-1106, USA, miekoy@umich.edu

Abstract: This study examined the relationships among enculturation, attitudes supporting intimate partner violence (IPV-supporting attitudes), and gender role attitudes among one of the largest Asian Indian population groups in the US. Data were collected via computer-assisted telephone interviews with a random sample of Gujarati men and women aged 18-64 in Metropolitan Detroit. Using structural equation modeling, we modeled the effects of three components of enculturation (behavior, values, and community participation) on gender role attitudes and IPV-supporting attitudes among married respondents (N = 373). Analyses also accounted for the effects of respondent age, education, religious service attendance, perceived financial difficulty, and lengths of residence in the US. The second-order, overall construct of enculturation was the strongest predictor of IPV-supporting attitudes (standardized B = 0.61), but not gender role attitudes. Patriarchal gender role attitudes were positively associated with IPV-supporting attitudes (B = 0.49). In addition to the overall effect of the enculturation construct, two of the components of enculturation had specific effects. "Enculturation-values" had a specific positive indirect association with IPV-supporting attitudes, through its relationship with patriarchal gender role attitudes. However, "enculturation-community participation" was negatively associated with IPV-supporting attitudes, suggesting the importance of community-based prevention of IPV among this immigrant population group.

Intimate Partner Violence Victimization, Maternal Child Maltreatment, and the Mediating Impact of Changes in Family Structure

Author: Juby, Cindy1; Downs, William; Rindels, Barb1 University of Northern Iowa, Sabin, Room 235, Cedar Falls, IA, 50614, USA, cynthia.juby@uni.edu

Abstract: To examine the mediating effect of family structure in the relationship between paternal Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and maternal child maltreatment. The method was quantitative analysis of secondary data. Changes in family structure fully mediated the relationship between IPV victimization and maternal child physical abuse ( Delta = .069) and partially mediated the impact of IPV on maternal child psychological abuse ( Delta = .051). Households wherein IPV occurs are not only unsafe for children because of potential abuse by the perpetrators, they also create dynamics that increase the risk of child maltreatment by the IPV victim. Treating only substance abuse or managing only child maltreatment may be insufficient if these issues are the direct or indirect result of domestic violence. Programs that integrate services are urgently necessary to address the overlap of child abuse and domestic violence.

Engagement in Child Protective Services: The Role of Substance Abuse, Intimate Partner Violence and Race

Author: Mirick, Rebecca G11 Salem State University School of Social Work, Salem, MA, USA, rglurz@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1532610674?accountid=14925

Abstract: Effectively engaging parents has been a continuing challenge for child protection workers. A lack of engagement can lead to significant negative consequences for families. This preliminary study explored the ability of family factors (e.g.; legal involvement, history with child protective services, substance abuse, child placement, intimate partner violence, identifying as Black, Latino or biracial) to predict parent engagement with child welfare services. A four dimensional measure of engagement with child protective services (Yatchmenoff, Res Soc Work Pract 15(2):84-96, 2005) was used which included receptivity, buy-in, working relationship and mistrust. The variables of parental substance abuse, intimate partner violence and identifying as Black, Latino or biracial were significant predictors of all four dimensions of engagement although each dimension was predicted by a unique combination of these factors. Substance abuse positively predicted engagement while intimate partner violence and identifying as Black, Latino or biracial negatively predicted engagement. The implications of these findings for child protection practice are described. Recommendations are made for future research.

An Updated Feminist View of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: George, Jayashree1; Stith, Sandra M1 Marriage and Family Therapy Program. Kansas State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1559006565?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article, we explore intimate partner violence (IPV) from an intersectional, feminist perspective. We describe how an updated feminist view guides us to a perspective on IPV that is more strongly grounded in an antioppressive, nonviolent, socially just feminist stance than a second-wave gender-essential feminist stance that suggests that patriarchy is the cause of IPV. At the time we began to work together it seemed that a researcher had to be identified as a 'family violence' researcher or a 'feminist' researcher of violence against women, and that it wasn't possible to be a feminist researcher who looked beyond patriarchy as the cause of IPV. We advocate critically thinking about essentialist practices in clinical work so that we can maintain an antioppressive, socially just, nonviolent approach to working with clients who experience IPV.

Developmental Changes in Threat and Self-Blame for Preschoolers Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)

Author: Miller, Laura E1; Howell, Kathryn H; Graham-Bermann, Sandra A1 University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1542000564?accountid=14925

Abstract: The presence of threat and self-blame in children exposed to violence in the home has been linked to a number of negative behavioral and emotional consequences across developmental periods. Little research, however, has examined self-reported attributions of threat and self-blame in children under the age of 6. The current study evaluated the developmental trajectories of appraisals of threat and self-blame in preschool-aged children recently exposed to intimate partner violence. It was hypothesized that (a) children's appraisals of threat and self-blame would naturally decrease over time and (b) there would be a main effect of child sex on appraisals of self-blame but not threat, such that girls would report higher levels of self-blame than boys. Participants included 68 preschool-aged children (ages 4-6) who were interviewed at two time points over the course of 1 year. Multilevel modeling was employed to examine the effects of violence exposure, child age, and child sex over time. Children's attributions of threat were stable over the course of 1 year, but greater child age was related to lower appraisals of threat. Children's appraisals of self-blame increased over time, and there was a trend for girls to report more self-blame than did boys. It appears that without intervention, young children may be at risk of developing relatively stable maladaptive cognitive patterns, thereby heightening their risk of subsequent developmental psychopathology. Furthermore, girls may need additional intervention targeted at addressing attributions of self-blame. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Measuring Attitudes About Women's Recourse After Exposure to Intimate Partner Violence: The ATT-RECOURSE Scale

Author: Yount, Kathryn M1; VanderEnde, Kristin; Zureick-Brown, Sarah; Minh, Tran Hung; Schuler, Sidney Ruth; Anh, Hoang Tu1 Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1542001068?accountid=14925

Abstract: Attitudes about intimate partner violence (IPV) against women are widely surveyed, but attitudes about women's recourse after exposure to IPV are understudied, despite their importance for intervention. Designed through qualitative research and administered in a probability sample of 1,054 married men and women 18 to 50 years in My Hao District, Vietnam, the ATT-RECOURSE scale measures men's and women's attitudes about a wife's recourse after exposure to physical IPV. Data were initially collected for nine items. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with one random split-half sample (N1 = 526) revealed a one-factor model with significant loadings (0.316-0.686) for six items capturing a wife's silence, informal recourse, and formal recourse. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with the other random split-half sample (N2 = 528) showed adequate fit for the six-item model and significant factor loadings of similar magnitude to the EFA results (0.412-0.669). For the six items retained, men consistently favored recourse more often than did women (52.4%-66.0% of men vs. 41.9%-55.2% of women). Tests for uniform differential item functioning (DIF) by gender revealed one item with significant uniform DIF, and adjusting for this revealed an even larger gap in men's and women's attitudes, with men favoring recourse, on average, more than women. The six-item ATT-RECOURSE scale is reliable across independent samples and exhibits little uniform DIF by gender, supporting its use in surveys of men and women. Further methodological research is discussed. Research is needed in Vietnam about why women report less favorable attitudes than men regarding women's recourse after physical IPV.

Family Violence, Bullying, Fighting, and Substance Use Among Adolescents: A Longitudinal Mediational Model

Author: Espelage, Dorothy L1; Low, Sabina; Rao, Mrinalini A; Hong, Jun S; Little, Todd D1 University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1559007706?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social interaction learning theory provides a framework for understanding the potential overlap among adolescent problem behaviors such as family violence, aggression, and substance use. The current study assessed the longitudinal, reciprocal relations among family violence, bullying perpetration, fighting perpetration, and adolescent substance use using a sample of 1,232 students from four Midwestern middle schools. Students completed measures on family dynamics, bullying and fighting behaviors, and alcohol and drug use three times over 18 months. Structural equation modeling results indicated that bullying and fighting perpetration mediated the link between family violence and substance use only for males, but not for females. For females, family violence at Wave 1 was related to greater substance use at Wave 3. Adapted from the source document.

Teen Dating Violence: A Comparison of Self-Report Measures

Author: Caselman, Tonia1; Dubriwny, Nicholas; Curzon, Emily Lester1 Anne and Henry Zarrow School of Social Work, University of Oklahoma-Tulsa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1650142203?accountid=14925

Abstract: Measurement is the foundation of all research. Adequate measures should be developmentally appropriate and demonstrate reliability, validity, and sensitivity. With the recent attention to teen dating violence, measures have been developed to investigate this phenomenon and to evaluate prevention/ intervention programs. Although some of these instruments measure actual acts of violence, others measure attitudes regarding acts of violence. Each of these instruments is described along with its advantages and limitations. A comparison of measures is also presented so that researchers and clinicians can make informed decisions when selecting measures. Adapted from the source document.

Trends in Physical Dating Violence Victimization Among U.S. High School Students, 1999-2011

Author: Rothman, Emily F1; Xuan, Ziming1 Department of Community Health Sciences, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1550996903?accountid=14925

Abstract: Dating violence is a serious form of violence that places students at risk for injury, death, and negative mental health sequelae. The current analysis presents data on the prevalence of dating violence over a 12-year period among a nationally representative sample of high school-attending youth in the United States, stratified by race and gender. Data from the national Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) 1999-2011 revealed that physical dating violence victimization rates are similar for males and females; the 12-year prevalence rate of physical dating violence victimization was 9.4% for males and 9.2% for females. Black and multiracial students were at increased risk for dating violence victimization in comparison to their White, Asian, and Hispanic counterparts. There were no changes in the reported rate of dating violence victimization over the 12-year period. Adapted from the source document.

Victim, Risque, Provocateur: Popular Cultural Narratives of Rihanna's Experience of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Houlihan, Annette; Raynor, Sharon D

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667946868?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using lenses of Black and Brown feminisms, this article examines popular music artist Chris Brown's 2009 assault of his then partner, Rihanna. Since the assault, Rihanna's identity has been continually written and represented as both inherently victimised and somehow responsible for provoking Brown's violence. The article draws attention to young Black and Brown women's constructions as both 'at-risk' and 'risky', and how Rihanna's 'risque' public personae has been misinterpreted by some sectors of the community, including the media, as victim ('at-risk') and provocateur ('risky'). Rihanna's 'risqueness' is constructed on her gender (female), race, ethnicity and nationality (Bajan, Black, Carribean, islander, migrant). Due to her gender, race and overtly 'sexual' positioning, Rihanna has been subjected to victim-blaming at the hands of the media, but her implied 'risqueness' was also demonstrated through hyper-surveillance by the media after the assault. This representation is both highly gendered and racialised. Despite being subjected as 'at-risk' and objectified as 'risky', Rihanna found a voice to document and voice her experience of violence. This article unpacks these scripts about her experiences of violence to recognise similar issues young Black and Brown women experience within intimate relationships and to further open up the dialogue in this area. Adapted from the source document.

Factors Related to Sexual Abuse and Forced Sex in a Sample of Women Experiencing Police-involved Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Messing, Jill Theresa; Thaller, Jonel; Bagwell, Meredith

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1567041129?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner sexual violence (IPSV) is a significant social problem, particularly among women who are concurrently experiencing physical violence in their intimate relationships. This research examined the prevalence and factors associated with IPSV among a sample of women recruited at the scene of police-involved intimate partner violence incidents (N = 432). Within this sample, 43.98 percent of participants reported experiencing IPSV; this includes 17.36 percent who reported sexual abuse and 26.62 percent who reported forced sex. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the factors related to sexual abuse and forced sex, controlling for victim and relationship characteristics. Compared with women not reporting IPSV, women who were sexually abused or forced into sexual intercourse were significantly more likely to experience strangulation, feelings of shame, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Women whose partners had forced sex were more likely to report that they had a child in common with their abusive partner; and that their partner was sexually jealous, had threatened to kill them, had stalked or harassed them, or caused them to have a miscarriage due to abuse. These findings can be used to better inform social work practitioners about the prevalence and nature of IPSV and the associated risk factors, and can assist in routine screening and intervention.

An ecological model of intimate partner violence perpetration at different levels of severity

Author: Smith Slep, Amy M; Foran, Heather M; Heyman, Richard E

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1622296214?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health concern. This study proposed and tested an ecological model of both general and clinically significant (i.e., injurious or fear-evoking) IPV perpetration (IPV perp). Risk and promotive factors from multiple ecological levels of influence (i.e., individual, family, workplace, community) were hypothesized to be important in the prediction of IPVPerp. Although clinically significant IPV perp and general IPV perp were hypothesized to relate, specific risks for clinically significant IPV perp were hypothesized. U.S. Air Force active duty members and civilian spouses (N = 34,861 men; 24,331 women) from 82 sites worldwide completed the 2006 Community Assessment, an anonymous online survey assessing IPV perp along with a variety of potential risk and promotive factors. Final structural equation models for men and women, cross-validated in holdout samples, clearly supported the relevance of an ecological approach to IPV perp. Factors from all 4 levels were associated with both general IPV perp and clinically significant IPV perp, with relatively distal community and workplace factors operating via more proximal individual and family level variables (e.g., relationship satisfaction). The results suggest a variety of both established and novel potential targets for indirectly targeting general and clinically significant IPV perp by improving risk profiles at the individual, family, workplace, and community levels.

The Impact of Anger on the Intimate Partner Violence Decision-Making Process

Author: Nedegaard, Randall C1; Sbrocco, Tracy1 Department of Social Work, University of North Dakota, 225 Centennial Drive, Stop 7135, Grand Forks, ND, 58202, USA, randall.nedegaard@und.edu

Abstract: McFall's (1982, 1989) Social Information Processing (SIP) model outlines different stages in cognitive processing and decision-making that may be deficient in men who engage in interpersonal violence (IPV). A decision-making task was developed to assess the utility of abusive and nonabusive behaviors among 32 men who engage in mild IPV, 32 maritally distressed men, and 32 nondistressed men. Because anger impacts appraisal and decision-making (e.g., Lerner and Tiedens in Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 19, 115-137, 2006), all participants were randomly assigned to an anger induction or neutral induction condition. As hypothesized, the perceived utility for abusive behavior was greater for angry abusive men and the perceived utility of control appeared to significantly contribute to this difference. Specific deficits in the IPV group were found, supporting a SIP model of IPV, aiding in understanding the function of violent behavior. Despite study limitations, these findings have implications for enhancing specific skill training components of treatment for abusive men.

Factors Contributing to Intimate Partner Violence among Men in Kerala, India

Author: Jin, Xiaochun1; Doukas, Ashley; Beiting, Magdalen; Viksman, Ann1 Department of Psychology, The New School, 80 Fifth Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY, 10011, USA, jinx@newschool.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1557526020?accountid=14925

Abstract: Kerala is one of the most progressive states in India in terms of women's opportunities for higher education and employment. Despite these advancements in gender equality, intimate partner violence (IPV) against women remains high, with some studies finding increased rates of IPV in Kerala relative to other states. This study examines contributing factors to male-to-female IPV in Kerala. One hundred and thirty-four men were surveyed on perceived marital power, early exposure to violence, drinking habits, depression, and marital satisfaction in relation to current IPV. Forty percent of participants reported incidents of IPV in the past year. Batterers scored significantly higher on childhood abuse, drinking, depression, and marital dissatisfaction. These four predictor variables were all significantly correlated with male-to-female IPV, but perceived marital power was only partially correlated with IPV. Abuse in childhood emerged as the strongest predictor of current IPV. Implications and suggestions for further research are discussed.

Identifying Predictors for Children Witnessing Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Nouer, Simonne S1; Mackey, SeeTrail N; Tipton, Nathan G; Miller, Ashley C; Connor, Pamela D1 Department of Preventive Medicine, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, 66 North Pauline Street, Suite 101, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA, dconnor@uthsc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1557531465?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research has shown that intimate partner violence (IPV) prevalence and severity is higher and IPV duration is longer among couples that have children. Women frequently report that their children are the reason why they stay, leave, or return to an IPV relationship. Our study used results from a two-wave telephone survey to determine what IPV-associated factors were significant predictors of respondents' children witnessing IPV, as well as estimating prevalence of children's exposure to violence. We found that an increase in respondents' age was significantly associated with increased odds of a child being exposed to violence. We also found that children witnessing violence were almost twice as likely to have mothers who reported leaving abusers. We hypothesize that increasing age corresponds to improved confidence in help-seeking behaviors. Our findings represent an important first step for future research on understanding how children influence IPV victims' decision-making in seeking out service providers for help.

Perceived Quality of Life and Health Complaints in Children Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Grip, Karin K1; Almqvist, Kjerstin; Axberg, Ulf; Broberg, Anders G1 Department of Psychology, Gothenburg University, Box 500, Gothenburg, Vastergotland, 405 30, Sweden, Karin.grip@psy.gu.se

Abstract: Children 9 to 13 years old exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) reported on their violence exposure, attachment to both parents, temperament (negative emotionality and emotion regulation), perceived quality of life, and health complaints. Half of the children perceived their quality of life as good and did not have recurrent health complaints. When controlling for socioeconomic status, health complaints were associated with higher IPV exposure and negative emotionality, whereas quality of life was associated with attachment security, higher capacity for emotion regulation, and lower negative emotionality. These results underscore the importance of increasing and supporting the capacity of children exposed to IPV to handle and express their emotions, as well as making school nurses and other primary care practitioners more attentive to IPV as a possible background factor in children's health complaints.

Can Johnson's Typology of Adult Partner Violence Apply to Teen Dating Violence?

Author: Zweig, Janine M1; Yahner, Jennifer; Dank, Meredith; Lachman, Pamela1 Urban Institute

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1650147785?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors examined the applicability of Johnson's typology of adult intimate partner violence to female and male youth's reports of teen dating violence. A total of 5,647 youth from 10 schools participated in the survey, 3,745 of whom reported currently being in a dating relationship or having been in one during the prior year (52% female, 74% White). Using hierarchical cluster analysis to classify youth into high-control versus no-/low-control violent experiences, the authors found that Johnson's typology provides a workable framework for examining the violent experiences of dating teens. For the one third of youth in violent relationships, the most common type of violence perpetrated was situational couple violence (86% for females and 80% for males), followed by intimate terrorism (7% for females and 11% for males). Six percent of females and males reported using violent resistance in their relationships, and 1% of females and 4% of males reported mutual violent control. Adapted from the source document.

Women and children versus domestic violence. Legal reflections, needs and challenges in Spain today

Author: Villanueva Sainz-Pardo, Pilar11 Independent Researcher, Lawyer, Member of Valencia's Bar Association (Ilustre Colegio de Abogados de Valencia, ICAV), Spain

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667946814?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence against women and girls or gender-based violence is a form of discrimination that constitutes 'violence that is directed against a woman because she is a woman or that affects women disproportionately'. Violence against women has carelessly become a significant global public health problem affecting one-third of women in the world in 2013. Killings of women and girls by their male partners or ex-partners are not isolated incidents, but constitute 'the ultimate act of violence that is experienced in a continuum of violence'. Gender-based domestic violence remains the most prevalent form of violence against women and girls that affects women of all social strata across the world. Violence against women, in the private sphere and in its different manifestations, is tantamount to violations of the rights to life, equality, dignity and non-discrimination, the right not to be subjected to torture and to other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, the right to liberty and security of person, the right to equal protection under the law, and the right to equality in the family, among other human rights. In addition, children who are victims and witnesses of that gender-based domestic violence suffer adverse effects on their health and in other ways also are 'severely negatively impacted by [that] violence'. However gender-based domestic violence measures to protect child victims and witnesses of gender-related domestic violence remain weak in spite of the undeniable consensus among States on rights applicable to child victims and witnesses of crime. This article provides an overview of the issue of gender-based domestic violence and analyses the consideration given to the woman and child (of that woman) - both victims of intimate-partner domestic violence under international law and regional European law, and, in addition, under Spanish domestic legislation. The article highlights the latest developments in those three legal settings, including the forthcoming entry into force of the challenging and most comprehensive legal instrument on violence against women in the world today, the Istanbul Convention. The Convention provides at last formal (through judicial practice and legal instruments) recognition of children who witness gender-based domestic violence as victims of that gender-based violence. Also reviewed are recent jurisprudence/judicial practice, legal developments and challenges on this important subject in Spain. Final recommendations based on the aforementioned international, regional and domestic analysis are made to the State of Spain, recommendations applicable indeed to the practice in any country seeking international human rights compliance, good practices and redress, in an effective fight against gender-based domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

Dating Violence, Young African American Males, and Risk and Protective Factors: A Review of the Literature

Author: Stepteau-Watson, Desiree11 Department of Social Work, University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667947892?accountid=14925

Abstract: This report examines the extant literature on dating violence, young African American males, and risk and protective factors. Studies have shown that correlates exist between community factors, parental discipline, and gender role beliefs in young African American males that place them at risk for dating perpetration. Studies have also shown that protective factors such as adequate adult supervision, social support, and problem-solving skills exist and can mitigate risk. Implications for research and programming are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Beyond Deficits: Intimate Partner Violence, Maternal Parenting, and Child Behavior Over Time

Author: Greeson, Megan R1; Kennedy, Angie C; Bybee, Deborah I; Beeble, Marisa; Adams, Adrienne E; Sullivan, Cris1 Department of Psychology, DePaul University, 562 Byrne Hall, 2219 North Kenmore Ave., Chicago, IL, 60614, USA, mgreeson@depaul.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1557279423?accountid=14925

Abstract: Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) has negative consequences for children's well-being and behavior. Much of the research on parenting in the context of IPV has focused on whether and how IPV victimization may negatively shape maternal parenting, and how parenting may in turn negatively influence child behavior, resulting in a deficit model of mothering in the context of IPV. However, extant research has yet to untangle the interrelationships among the constructs and test whether the negative effects of IPV on child behavior are indeed attributable to IPV affecting mothers' parenting. The current study employed path analysis to examine the relationships among IPV, mothers' parenting practices, and their children's externalizing behaviors over three waves of data collection among a sample of 160 women with physically abusive partners. Findings indicate that women who reported higher levels of IPV also reported higher levels of behavior problems in their children at the next time point. When parenting practices were examined individually as mediators of the relationship between IPV and child behavior over time, one type of parenting was significant relationship, such that IPV lead to higher authoritative parenting and lower child behavior problems. On the other hand, there was no evidence that higher levels of IPV contributed to more child behavior problems due to maternal parenting. Instead, IPV had a significant cumulative indirect effect on child behavior via the stability of both IPV and behavior over time. Implications for promoting women's and children's well-being in the context of IPV are discussed.

Village Tolerance of Abuse, Women's Status, and the Ecology of Intimate Partner Violence in Rural Uttar Pradesh, India

Author: Mogford, Elizabeth1; Lyons, Christopher J1 Western Washington University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1641423189?accountid=14925

Abstract: We explore the multilevel determinants of intimate partner violence (IPV) against women in rural Uttar Pradesh, India. We focus on village tolerance of abuse and its ability to regulate the effects of individual and village-level women's status and social capital. Using individual and village data from the 1998 to 1999 India National Family Health Survey, we find that village tolerance and women's status at individual and village levels help explain the risk of IPV. Village tolerance of abuse also moderates the ability of village-level women's status and social capital to protect women from IPV. Results underscore the need to understand processes that sustain and/or challenge violence-legitimating norms. Adapted from the source document.

Conditional Inference Trees: A Method for Predicting Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Salis, Katie Lee1; Kliem, Soren; O'Leary, K Daniel1 Stony Brook University.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667949430?accountid=14925

Abstract: A number of different methodologies have been employed to investigate the complex relationship between psychological and physical aggression. Herein, a method of unbiased recursive partitioning (conditional inference trees) was applied to a longitudinal sample to identify cutoffs of psychological aggression at baseline that differentiate between individuals who do and do not perpetrate physical aggression at follow-up. The algorithm categorized men into low- and high-risk groups, and women into mild-, moderate-, or high-risk categories of perpetration. Couples responded anonymously to a self-report measure of psychological and physical aggression (CTS2) at baseline and a 12-month follow-up. Sensitivity analyses for predicting physical aggression reached as high as 59% for women and 60% for men. Adapted from the source document.

Risk and Resilience of Immigrant Women in Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Paat, Yok-Fong11 Social Work Department, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667948067?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence inflicted against women by their intimate partners presents an especially critical area of inquiry among battered female immigrants following the striking ethnic diversification after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. This article reviews contemporary literature of intimate partner violence; seeks to illustrate the current state of knowledge; and provides a conceptual framework that summarizes the unique experiences of immigrant women confronting the challenges of couple violence. Five underlying cultural and structural mechanisms influencing immigrant women's susceptibility, re-adjustment, and recovery were identified: (1) acculturation, (2) cultural mechanisms, (3) mental health, (4) structural elements, (5) legal contexts, and (6) social support. A synopsis of practice implications in the context of the literature is discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Got One Another's Backs: Mother-Teen Relationships in Families Escaping Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Chanmugam, Amy11 Social Work Department, The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667949565?accountid=14925

Abstract: This Life Story study gained a comprehensive picture of experiences of young adolescents (ages 12-14) accompanying mothers in emergency domestic violence shelters. A holistic, chronological approach in interviews with an ethnically diverse sample of youth and their mothers (N = 27) yielded insights into perspectives on relationships. This article focuses on the complex thematic finding 'interconnected family boundaries,' a central dynamic in mother-youth relationships characterized by emotional closeness, highly cohesive boundaries, and interdependence in problem solving regarding family issues. Participants identified this dynamic as essential for adaptation yet entailing losses. Discussion considers theoretical triangulation and implications for research, intervention, and practitioner education. Adapted from the source document.

Factors Related to Domestic Violence in Asia: The Conflict between Culture and Patriarchy

Author: Brown, Jac11 Department of Psychology, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667947513?accountid=14925

Abstract: While most research on domestic violence (DV) has focused on the West, there is an increasing interest in DV in Asian countries. This article explores the extent of DV against women in areas where most of the research has been conducted, including South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. The factors associated with DV in the Asian region is explored through the Heise model that considers four levels of analysis, including personal factors, the microsystem, the exosystem, and the macrosystem. The analysis points to the importance of the patriarchal culture that is inextricably linked to culture that is resistant to change and must be addressed at a range of levels. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic violence and child protection: towards a collaborative approach across the two service sectors

Author: Zannettino, Lana1; McLaren, Helen1 School of Nursing & Midwifery, Flinders University, Bedford Park, SA, Australia.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667947784?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence continues to be one of the most significant aspects of child abuse and neglect in Australia. However, the children are not well served by either child protection or domestic violence service sectors, which continue to operate as segregated, tertiary response systems. This paper reports on research that examined bridges and barriers to effective collaboration between child protection and domestic violence services in responding to children affected by domestic violence. The differing conceptions and responses of the workers from each service sector, in relation to children and families affected by domestic violence, is discussed in the light of gaps in service provision in both sectors. In doing so, areas of common ground for more effective collaboration between these service sectors are identified, including the prioritizing of emotional and psychological abuse, supporting and empowering abused mothers, strengthening the mother-child relationship, and supporting children and families across a continuum of service provision, particularly in the medium- to long-term. Understanding each other and finding common ground across the two service sectors is paramount to improving how each responds to children and families affected by domestic violence.

Asking the Tough Questions: Obstetrical Screening for Depression and Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Dunn, Donna; McCartney, Annie

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667953590?accountid=14925

Abstract: The prevalence of depression during pregnancy is estimated to be 13%-20%, while rates of IPV may be as high as 20%. These rates might not be an accurate reflection due to inadequate screening practices. Detection rates for depression during pregnancy may be as low as 0.8%. Similarly, detection of IPV during pregnancy is low but is increased when the provider repeatedly screens during multiple prenatal appointments. Most women report that the first incidence of IPV occurred during pregnancy and often continues throughout the pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists report that almost 75% of pregnant women initiate prenatal care in the first trimester, averaging 12-13 prenatal visits throughout their pregnancy. These frequent prenatal visits provide an opportunity to build trust and rapport with the health care team, creating an environment which is ideal to screen for depression and intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV during pregnancy is associated with negative outcomes to the mother and unborn child. Adapted from the source document.

Evidence of increased STI/HIV-related risk behavior among male perpetrators of intimate partner violence in Guatemala: results from a national survey

Author: Hembling, John1; Andrinopoulos, Katherine1 Department of Global Health Systems and Development, Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, LA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667951739?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health problem with a demonstrated link to increased sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV-related risk and vulnerability. While IPV is an important issue in Central America, the link to STI/HIV risk has not been explored in this region. In this study, the relationship between emotional and physical/sexual IPV and the STI/HIV-related risk behaviors of sex worker patronage and infidelity is assessed among male IPV perpetrators using data from a national survey conducted in 2009 in Guatemala (n = 4773 married/partnered men). Bivariate associations between background characteristics and emotional and physical IPV perpetration were explored. Logistic regression models were run to test associations between IPV for each sexual risk behavior. Perpetration of emotional and physical/sexual IPV was more common among married/partnered men who were older than 24, had more education, lived in urban areas, or were in common law versus married unions. Reports of past-year emotional IPV perpetration increased as wealth quintile increased. After adjusting for demographics and other characteristics, physical/sexual IPV perpetration was associated with past-year infidelity (AOR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.6). Lifetime emotional IPV (AOR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7) and physical/sexual IPV 1.6 (95% CI 1.2-2.0) were positively associated with a history of sex worker patronage. Endorsement of traditional gender role norms showed a marginally positive association with past-year infidelity in the adjusted model (AOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.8). The study findings from Guatemala reinforce the growing evidence globally that male IPV perpetrators are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior, including sex worker patronage and main partner infidelity. The concurrency of violence and increased STI/HIV risk may compound the health risks for female victims of IPV who also face injury and psychological trauma. Integration of prevention and screening of IPV and STI/HIV prevention services should be adopted in Guatemala and other similar contexts. Adapted from the source document.

The European Court of Human Rights and domestic violence: Valiuliene v. Lithuania

Author: McQuigg, Ronagh J.A.11 School of Law, Queen's University Belfast, United Kingdom

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667948553?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article analyses the recent jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on the issue of domestic violence, with a particular focus on Valiuliene v. Lithuania. It seems that to date the court's jurisprudence on this issue is somewhat inconsistent, and with Valiuliene v. Lithuania the court was given an opportunity to clarify its approach in this area. There are certainly a number of positive aspects to the court's judgment; however there are also difficulties with the approach of the court in this case. Overall it is to be hoped that the judgment in Valiuliene v. Lithuania will mark the beginning of a more coherent jurisprudence regarding domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

Victim or Whore: The Similarities and Differences between Victim's Experiences of Domestic Violence and Sex Trafficking

Author: Roe-Sepowitz, Dominique E1; Hickle, Kristine E; Dahlstedt, Jaime; Gallagher, James1 School of Social Work, Arizona State University, Phoenix, Arizona, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667948069?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research review addresses the similarities and differences between domestic violence and sex trafficking victimization. While there is evidence that domestic violence and sex trafficking often co-occur, there is a large disparity in the understanding and interventions utilized by law enforcement as well as the services available for victims of each crime despite the considerable overlap of victimization. This article explores current research regarding domestic violence and sex trafficking with a focus towards identifying areas of overlap and areas distinct to sex trafficking. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This research examined whether children's threat and self-blame appraisals regarding interparental conflict and their beliefs about the justifiability of aggression predicted children's externalizing problems in families in which there had been recent severe intimate partner violence (IPV). Participants were 106 children (62 boys, 44 girls) aged 7 to 10 and their mothers. Families in which there had been recent severe IPV were recruited during their stay at a domestic violence shelter. Children completed measures of threat, self-blame, beliefs about the justifiability of aggression, and externalizing problems. Mothers completed a measure of children's externalizing problems. Measures were completed at 3 time points, spaced 6 months apart. In multilevel modeling analyses, threat appraisals and beliefs about the justifiability of aggression were positively associated with children's reports of externalizing problems concurrently, and self-blame appraisals were positively associated with mothers' reports of externalizing problems concurrently. In prospective analyses, beliefs about the justifiability of aggression at 1 time point were positively associated with children's reports of externalizing problems 6 months later. The results provide partial support for the modified cognitive-contextual framework. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

The effects of domestic violence allegations on custody evaluators' recommendations

Author: Hans, Jason D; Hardesty, Jennifer L; Haselschwerdt, Megan L; Frey, Laura M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667951451?accountid=14925

Abstract: Judges and attorneys often request professional assessments from child custody evaluators when allegations of adult domestic violence (DV) have been made, but it is unclear whether and how evaluators' recommendations are impacted by these allegations. Custody evaluators (N = 607) in the United States responded to a multiple-segment factorial vignette designed to examine the effects of 2 key factors in DV allegations: type of alleged violence (conflict-based, control-based) and counterallegations (none, mutual, and female-initiated). Effects of control- versus conflict-based DV allegations by the mother on custody recommendations were small and the majority of evaluators recommended joint custody regardless of violence type. Reported confidence in making a recommendation increased once the father responded to the allegation, but to a smaller degree when a counterallegation of mutual or female-initiated violence was made. Evaluators were no more skeptical about the potential motive of a counterallegation in the context of controlling behavior than in the context of conflict-based behavior. Overall, results indicate that most custody evaluators are not sufficiently sensitized to distinguish between situational couple violence and coercive controlling behavior, and the postseparation safety of mothers and their children may therefore be jeopardized.

Domestic Violence, Children's Agency and Mother-Child Relationships: Towards a More Advanced Model

Author: Katz, Emma11 School of Sociology and Social Policy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667951197?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although domestic violence research increasingly recognises children's agency, this awareness has not extended to our understanding of children's relationships with their abused mothers. Findings suggesting that some children actively support their mother, and encourage her to leave the perpetrator, have been consistently under-discussed. This article argues that the model of parent-child relationships used by most domestic violence research sees children as passive and contributes to mother-blaming discourses. Analysing key quantitative and qualitative research, I suggest that a more sophisticated model of parent-child relationships is needed to understand how children's agency affects them, their mothers and the domestic violence situation.

Patterns of Cumulative Abuse Among Female Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence: Links to Women's Health and Socioeconomic Status

Author: Davies, Lorraine1; Ford-Gilboe, Marilyn; Willson, Andrea; Varcoe, Colleen; Wuest, Judith; Campbell, Jacquelyn; Scott-Storey, Kelly1 University of Western Ontario, London, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667943748?accountid=14925

Abstract: Drawing on the Women's Health Effects Study, a community sample of women (N = 309) who recently left an abusive partner, this study examines patterns of cumulative abuse experiences over the life course, their socioeconomic correlates, and associations with a range of health outcomes. Latent class analysis identified four groups of women with differing cumulative abuse profiles: Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Dominant, Child Abuse and IPV, All Forms, and All Forms Extreme. We find a relationship pattern between cumulative abuse and socioeconomic circumstances, and significantly worse health outcomes among women with the All Forms Extreme profile. Implications for research and practice are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

When Women Tell: Intimate Partner Violence and the Factors Related to Police Notification

Author: Novisky, Meghan A1; Peralta, Robert L1 Kent State University, OH, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667944115?accountid=14925

Abstract: We analyze how victim perceptions of mandatory arrest policies, perpetrator substance use, and presence of children are related to decisions to invoke law enforcement assistance. Logistic regression was used on survey responses from women receiving care in domestic violence shelters. Results suggest that as victim support for mandatory arrest increases, the odds of law enforcement notification of the abuse also increase. Accordingly, mandatory arrest may simply be reducing the probability of reporting intimate partner violence (IPV) among those who do not support the policy, instead of reducing IPV. Results also suggest that perpetrator substance use plays a significant role in law enforcement notification. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

World Assumptions, Religiosity, and PTSD in Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Lilly, Michelle M1; Howell, Kathryn H; Graham-Bermann, Sandra1 Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667943512?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is among the most frequent types of violence annually affecting women. One frequent outcome of violence exposure is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The theory of shattered world assumptions represents one possible explanation for adverse mental health outcomes following trauma, contending that trauma disintegrates individuals' core assumptions that the world is safe and meaningful, and that the self is worthy. Research that explores world assumptions in relationship to survivors of IPV has remained absent. A more consistent finding in research on IPV suggests that religiosity is strongly associated with survivors' reactions to, and recovery from, IPV. The present study found that world assumptions was a significant mediator of the relationship between IPV exposure and PTSD symptoms. Religiosity was also significantly, positively related to PTSD symptoms, but was not significantly related to amount of IPV exposure. Though African American women reported more IPV exposure and greater religiosity than European American women in the sample, there were no interethnic differences in PTSD symptom endorsement. Implications of these findings are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Policing femininity, affirming masculinity: relationship violence, control and spatial limitation

Author: DeShong, Halimah A.F.11 Institute for Gender and Development Studies: Nita Barrow Unit (IGDS: NBU), University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus, Barbados

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667946808?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article, a feminist poststructuralist approach to discourse analysis is applied to examine the accounts of 35 Vincentian women and men on men's enactment of a range of violent, controlling and coercive acts in heterosexual relationships. The social languages participants employ in their explanations of men's abusive practices, and how these implicate particular gendered subject positions are discussed. Nested within this discussion is an exploration of how women's personal autonomy is regulated and contested in the context of violent intimate unions. Acts of violence by men, coupled with the threat of violence and other forms of control, serve to limit women's ability to navigate between the so-called private/domestic and other social spaces. Similar limits do not exist for men in these unions. This double standard is often presented as an effect of traditional and/or transcendental arrangements of gender in men's narratives, while women range between subverting and affirming dominant scripts of womanhood and manhood in speech.

The Effectiveness of a Mixed-mode Survey on Domestic Violence in Curacao: Response and Data Quality

Author: van Wijk, Nikil1; de Leeuw, Edith; de Bruijn, Jeanne1 Ministry of Health, Environment and Nature, Willemstad, Curacao nikil.vanwijk@gmail.com

Abstract: To collect reliable statistical data on domestic violence in Curacao, we conducted a large-scale quantitative study (n = 816). To meet with the special needs of the population and topic, we designed a tailored mixed-mode survey to assess the prevalence of domestic violence in Curacao and its health consequences. Great care was taken to reduce selective nonresponse and stimulate open and honest responses. We describe how we implemented and tailored a mixed-mode survey and report on its consequences for response and data quality. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Abstract: Gender-based domestic violence (DV) comes at great costs to the victims and society at large. Yet, many women hold the view that intimate partner violence (IPV) against women is appropriate behavior. This study aimed at exploring the nexus of experience of different forms of DV and acceptance of IPV as appropriate behavior. Using data from a survey of 480 out-of-school adolescent girls, the researcher shows that psychological abuse is a significant predictor of approval of DV resulting from the wife's failure to make food available for her husband with victims of abuse approving of violence against women. Conversely, victims of sexual abuse, more than nonvictims, disapproved of wife beating resulting from the wife going out without informing the husband. The implications of the findings are discussed and the study recommends deconstructing women's negative beliefs upon which DV rests.

Social Desirability and Partner Agreement of Men's Reporting of Intimate Partner Violence in Substance Abuse Treatment Settings

Author: Freeman, Andrew J1; Schumacher, Julie A; Coffey, Scott F1 University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, USA, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667950969?accountid=14925

Abstract: Estimates indicate that intimate partner violence (IPV) occurs in approximately 30% of relationships and up to 85% of the relationships of men in substance abuse treatment. However, partners consistently display poor agreement in reporting the presence of IPV. Social desirability is frequently offered as the primary reason for under-reporting of IPV by perpetrators. The goal of the current study was to explicitly test the social desirability hypothesis using both partners' reports of negotiation, psychological aggression, physical aggression, sexual aggression, and injuries in a substance abuse treatment sample. A total of 54 males and their female partners were recruited from a residential adult substance use treatment facility. Consistent with prior literature, partners displayed poor agreement about the presence of different types of IPV. The male partner's social desirability was not associated with his reporting of male-to-female physical aggression, psychological aggression, or injuries. Men who engaged in higher levels of self-deceptive enhancement and lower levels of impression management were more likely to under-report male-to-female sexual coercion. Overall, the findings question the generalized importance of social desirability in IPV reporting in substance abuse treatment populations.

Physical Dating Violence, Sexual Violence, and Unwanted Pursuit Victimization: A Comparison of Incidence Rates Among Sexual-Minority and Heterosexual College Students

Author: Edwards, Katie M1; Sylaska, Kateryna M; Barry, Johanna E; Moynihan, Mary M; Banyard, Victoria L; Cohn, Ellen S; Walsh, Wendy A; Ward, Sally K1 University of New Hampshire, Durham, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667951301?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to estimate the 6-month incidence rates of sexual assault, physical dating violence (DV), and unwanted pursuit (e.g., stalking) victimization among sexual-minority (i.e., individuals with any same-sex sexual experiences) college students with comparison data from non-sexual-minority (i.e., individuals with only heterosexual sexual experiences) college students. Participants (N = 6,030) were primarily Caucasian (92.7%) and non-sexual-minority (82.3%). Compared with non-sexual-minority students (N-SMS; n = 4,961), sexual-minority students (SMS; n = 1,069) reported significantly higher 6-month incidence rates of physical DV (SMS: 30.3%; N-SMS: 18.5%), sexual assault (SMS: 24.3%; N-SMS: 11.0%), and unwanted pursuit (SMS: 53.1%; N-SMS: 36.0%) victimization. We also explored the moderating role of gender and found that female SMS reported significantly higher rates of physical DV than female N-SMS, whereas male SMS and male N-SMS reported similar rates of physical DV. Gender did not moderate the relationship between sexual-minority status and victimization experiences for either unwanted pursuit or sexual victimization. These findings underscore the alarmingly high rates of interpersonal victimization among SMS and the critical need for research to better understand the explanatory factors that place SMS at increased risk for interpersonal victimization.

Intimate Partner Violence Before and During Pregnancy: Related Demographic and Psychosocial Factors and Postpartum Depressive Symptoms Among Mexican American Women

Author: Jackson, Corrie L1; Ciciolla, Lucia; Crnic, Keith A; Luecken, Linda J; Gonzales, Nancy A; Coonrod, Dean V1 Arizona State University, Tempe, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667950977?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although research examining intimate partner violence (IPV) has expanded in recent years, there has been relatively little examination of the related demographic and psychosocial factors, as well as mental health outcomes, for IPV before and during pregnancy, especially in a Mexican American population. The current study provides a snapshot of the occurrence of IPV in a community sample of low-income, perinatal Mexican American women (n = 320). Results indicated that 13.1% of the women reported IPV before pregnancy and 11.3% reported IPV during pregnancy. For both IPV before and during pregnancy, women born in the United States were more likely to report IPV than foreign-born women. For IPV before pregnancy, women who were not in a serious romantic relationship or reported a history of childhood trauma were also more likely to report IPV. For IPV during pregnancy, women who reported higher general stress and lower social support were also more likely to report IPV. Finally, the current study provided strong evidence that a history of IPV predicted elevated postpartum depressive symptoms, above and beyond the impact of prenatal depressive symptoms. This study brings greater awareness to a complex and harmful situation in an understudied population. Results are discussed in terms of the relation between demographic and psychosocial risk for IPV before and during pregnancy, acculturation, and postpartum depressive symptoms, as well as the implications for the development of future prevention and intervention programs.

Domestic Violence Against Women in Kosovo: A Qualitative Study of Women's Experiences

Author: Kelmendi, Kaltrina11 Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic, University of Prishtina, Kosova

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667949129?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on gender-based violence describes domestic violence by male partners as a major public health issue and serious human rights violation. Many studies have been conducted in Kosovo to understand the factors that contribute to violence against women. The present study aims to examine the experiences of battered women and their understanding of the violence from an ecological framework, by asking questions regarding personal, situational, and socio-cultural factors. The study is qualitative, consisting of 50 in-depth interviews with victims of domestic violence, and uses a grounded theory approach to identify main themes of the women's experiences. Findings from the study suggest that poverty, a patriarchal culture, strictly defined gender roles, and lack of programs for reintegrating victims subordinate women and leave them susceptible to domestic violence.

Intimate Partner Violence Victims as Mothers: Their Messages and Strategies for Communicating With Children to Break the Cycle of Violence

Author: Insetta, Emily R1; Akers, Aletha Y; Miller, Elizabeth; Yonas, Michael A; Burke, Jessica G; Hintz, Lindsay; Chang, Judy C1 University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, PA, USA

Abstract: Children whose mothers are victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) are at increased risk of adverse health and psychosocial consequences, including becoming victims or perpetrators of violence in their own relationships. This study aimed to understand the role mothers may play in preventing the perpetuation of violence in their children's lives. We performed semistructured interviews with 18 IPV victims who are mothers and were living at the Women's Center & Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh from July through November 2011. We sought to understand how they communicate with their children about IPV and relationships. These mothers described a desire to explain their IPV experience and offer advice about avoiding violence in relationships. As foundations for these discussions, they emphasized the importance of close relationships and open communication with their children. Although mothers are interested in talking about IPV and relationships and identify communication strategies for doing so, many have never discussed these topics with their children. These mothers need and want an intervention to help them learn how to communicate with their children to promote healthy relationships. Development of a program to facilitate communication between IPV victims and their children could create an important tool to empower mothers to break the cross-generational cycle of domestic violence.

The Association Between Substance Use and Intimate Partner Violence Within Black Male Same-Sex Relationships

Author: Wu, Elwin1; El-Bassel, Nabila; McVinney, L Donald; Hess, Leona; Fopeano, Mark V; Hwang, Hyesung G; Charania, Mahnaz; Mansergh, Gordon1 Columbia University, New York, NY, USA

Abstract: Compared with the extant research on heterosexual intimate partner violence (IPV)-including the knowledge base on alcohol and illicit drug use as predictors of such IPV-there is a paucity of studies on IPV among men who have sex with men (MSM), especially Black MSM. This study investigates the prevalence of experiencing and perpetrating IPV among a sample of Black MSM couples and examines whether heavy drinking and/or illicit substance use is associated with IPV. We conducted a secondary analysis on a data set from 74 individuals (constituting 37 Black MSM couples) screened for inclusion in a couple-based HIV prevention pilot study targeting methamphetamine-involved couples. More than one third (n= 28, 38%) reported IPV at some point with the current partner: 24 both experiencing and perpetrating, 2 experiencing only, and 2 perpetrating only. IPV in the past 30 days was reported by 21 (28%) of the participants: 18 both experiencing and perpetrating, 1 experiencing only, and 2 perpetrating only. Heavy drinking and methamphetamine use each was associated significantly with experiencing and perpetrating IPV throughout the relationship as well as in the past 30 days. Rock/crack cocaine use was significantly associated with any history of experiencing and perpetrating IPV. Altogether, IPV rates in this sample of Black MSM couples equal or exceed those observed among women victimized by male partners as well as the general population of MSM. This exploratory study points to a critical need for further efforts to understand and address IPV among Black MSM. Similar to heterosexual IPV, results point to alcohol and illicit drug use treatment as important avenues to improve the health and social well-being of Black MSM.

Abstract: African American women in the United States report intimate partner violence (IPV) more often than the general population of women. Overall, women underreport IPV because of shame, embarrassment, fear of retribution, or low expectation of legal support. African American women may be especially unlikely to report IPV because of poverty, low social support, and past experiences of discrimination. The purpose of this article is to determine the context in which low-income African American women disclose IPV. Consenting African American women receiving Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) services in WIC clinics were randomized to complete an IPV screening (Revised Conflict Tactics Scales-Short Form) via computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) or face-to-face interview (FTFI). Women (n = 368) reported high rates of lifetime and prior-year verbal (48%, 34%), physical (12%, 7%), sexual (10%, 7%), and any (49%, 36%) IPV, as well as IPV-related injury (13%, 7%). Mode of screening, but not interviewer race, affected disclosure. Women screened via FTFI reported significantly more lifetime and prior-year negotiation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 10.54, 3.97) and more prior-year verbal (aOR = 2.10), sexual (aOR = 4.31), and any (aOR = 2.02) IPV than CASI-screened women. African American women in a WIC setting disclosed IPV more often in face-to-face than computer screening, and race-matching of client and interviewer did not affect disclosure. Findings highlight the potential value of face-to-face screening to identify women at risk of IPV. Programs should weigh the costs and benefits of training staff versus using computer-based technologies to screen for IPV in WIC settings.

A Cycle of Violence? Examining Family-of-Origin Violence, Attitudes, and Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration

Author: Eriksson, Li1; Mazerolle, Paul1 Griffith University, Queensland, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667943677?accountid=14925

Abstract: Exposure to violence in the family-of-origin has consistently been linked to intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration in adulthood. However, whether the transmission of violence across generations is role- and gender-specific still remains unclear. The current study examined the effects of experiencing child abuse and observing parental violence on IPV perpetration among a sample of male arrestees (N = 303). The differential effects of observing violence perpetrated by same-sex (father to mother), opposite-sex (mother to father), and both parents on subsequent IPV perpetration were examined. Logistic regression analyses showed that while observing father-only violence and bidirectional interparental violence was predictive of IPV perpetration, observing mother-only violence and direct experiences of child abuse was not. These findings suggest that the transmission of violence across generations is both role- and gender-specific and highlight the importance of examining unique dimensions of partner violence to assess influences on children. The study further examined whether attitudes justifying wife beating mediate the effect of exposure to violence and subsequent IPV perpetration. Results showed that although attitudes were predictive of perpetration, these attitudes did not mediate the relationship. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Measuring Financial Strain in the Lives of Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Hetling, Andrea1; Stylianou, Amanda Mathisen; Postmus, Judy L1 Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667949036?accountid=14925

Abstract: Agencies serving survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) often include economic empowerment programs and approaches as a way to assist survivors struggling with avoiding poverty and gaining financial independence. Understanding and addressing the economic needs of IPV survivors are more complex than just knowing their income. Indeed, survivors' ability to manage their finances and any financial stress or strain should also be assessed to fully understand their needs. The Financial Strain Survey (FSS) provides a useful tool for screening and understanding survivors' complex financial needs. Using data from 457 IPV survivors from seven U.S. states and Puerto Rico, the current study evaluates the factor structure, reliability, and validity of using the FSS with IPV survivors. Findings indicate that the FSS is a reliable instrument for use with IPV survivors. The conclusion discusses the FSS as a practical tool for both practice and research with this population.

Cost-Effectiveness of Electronic Training in Domestic Violence Risk Assessment: ODARA 101

Author: Hilton, N Zoe1; Ham, Elke1 Waypoint Research Institute, Penetanguishene, Ontario, Canada, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1667949380?accountid=14925

Abstract: The need for domestic violence training has increased with the development of evidence-based risk assessment tools, which must be scored correctly for valid application. Emerging research indicates that training in domestic violence risk assessment can increase scoring accuracy, but despite the increasing popularity of electronic training, it is not yet known whether it can be an effective method of risk assessment training. In the present study, 87 assessors from various professions had training in the Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment either face-to-face or using an electronic training program. The two conditions were equally effective, as measured by performance on a post-training skill acquisition test. Completion rates were 100% for face-to-face and 86% for electronic training, an improvement over a previously evaluated manual-only condition. The estimated per-trainee cost of electronic training was one third that of face-to-face training and expected to decrease. More rigorous evaluations of electronic training for risk assessment are recommended. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]
