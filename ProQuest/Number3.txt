Abstract: The aim of this study was to analyze complaints of household physical aggression filed in Aracatuba, Sao Paulo, Brazil, from 2001 to 2005. The study described the social characteristics of aggressors & victims, their family relationship, locale, time of day, day of week, causes of aggression, kind of injuries, & use of alcohol/drugs by aggressor. Of 7,750 complaints of aggression, 1,844 involved domestic violence: 81.1% involved the spouse or partner (group A), 11.6% parents/guardians & children (group B); & 7.3% other family members (group C). In the three groups, the aggressions occurred mainly at home, & the aggressors were mostly males. In group A, aggressions occurred mainly on weekends (38.9%), with jealousy as the most frequently reported cause (21.5%). In group B, children/adolescents constituted 68.1% of the victims, mostly girls, while 5.2% of victims were 60 years old. All three groups involved mostly minor injuries like bruises & excoriations to the head & upper limbs. Aggressors were frequently under the influence of alcohol: 26.8% (group A), 21.6% (group B), 17.1 % (group C). Drug use was probably underestimated in the three groups (2.2%, 1.8%, & 4.5%, respectively). Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

The impact of exposure to domestic violence on children and young people: A review of the literature

Author: Holt, Stephanie1; Buckley, Helen; Whelan, Sadhbh1 Children's Research Centre, University of Dublin, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61773155?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: This article reviews the literature concerning the impact of exposure to domestic violence on the health and developmental well-being of children and young people. Impact is explored across four separate yet inter-related domains (domestic violence exposure and child abuse; impact on parental capacity; impact on child and adolescent development; and exposure to additional adversities), with potential outcomes and key messages concerning best practice responses to children's needs highlighted. Method A comprehensive search of identified databases was conducted within an 11-year framework (1995-2006). This yielded a vast literature which was selectively organized and analyzed according to the four domains identified above. Results This review finds that children and adolescents living with domestic violence are at increased risk of experiencing emotional, physical and sexual abuse, of developing emotional and behavioral problems and of increased exposure to the presence of other adversities in their lives. It also highlights a range of protective factors that can mitigate against this impact, in particular a strong relationship with and attachment to a caring adult, usually the mother. Conclusion Children and young people may be significantly affected by living with domestic violence, and impact can endure even after measures have been taken to secure their safety. It also concludes that there is rarely a direct causal pathway leading to a particular outcome and that children are active in constructing their own social world. Implications for interventions suggest that timely, appropriate and individually tailored responses need to build on the resilient blocks in the child's life. Practice implications This study illustrate the links between exposure to domestic violence, various forms of child abuse and other related adversities, concluding that such exposure may have a differential yet potentially deleterious impact for children and young people. From a resilient perspective this review also highlights range of protective factors that influence the extent of the impact of exposure and the subsequent outcomes for the child. This review advocates for a holistic and child-centered approach to service delivery, derived from an informed assessment, designed to capture a picture of the individual child's experience, and responsive to their individual needs.

Self-reported disciplinary practices among women in the child welfare system: Association with domestic violence victimization

Author: Kelleher, Kelly J1; Hazen, Andrea L; Coben, Jeffrey H; Wang, Yun; McGeehan, Jennifer; Kohl, Patricia L; Gardner, William P1 The Ohio State University, Department of Pediatrics, Columbus, OH, USA

Abstract: Objective: To examine the association between physical domestic violence victimization (both recent and more than a year in past measured by self-report) and self-reported disciplinary practices among female parents/caregivers in a national sample of families referred to child welfare. Methods Cross-sectional survey of more than 3,000 female caregivers in the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW) study, a nationally representative sample of children and their families referred to child welfare agencies for investigation of abuse and neglect. Women reported physical domestic violence victimization and their disciplinary practices for their child on different versions of the Conflict Tactics Scales. Results Four hundred and forty-three women reported prior year domestic violence, 1,161 reported domestic violence but not in the past 12 months, and 2,025 reported no domestic violence exposure. Any prior domestic violence exposure was associated with higher rates of self-reported psychological aggression, physical aggression and neglectful disciplinary behaviors as compared to those with no domestic violence victimization in bivariate comparisons. After controlling for child behavior, demographic factors, and maternal characteristics, those with remote and recent domestic violence victimization employed more self-reported psychological aggression, while only caregivers with recent DV reported more physical aggression or neglectful behaviors. Conclusions In a national child welfare sample, self-reported aggressive and neglectful parenting behaviors were common. In this sample, domestic violence victimization is associated with more self-reported aggressive and neglectful disciplinary behaviors among female caregivers. The mechanism for these associations is not clear. Practice implications Rates of aggressive and neglectful disciplinary practices are especially high among female parents/caregivers exposed to domestic violence. Child welfare agencies should plan routine and structured assessments for domestic violence among parents/caregivers and implement parenting interventions to reduce harmful disciplinary practices for those families identified.

Self-Control, Intimate Partner Abuse, and Intimate Partner Victimization: Testing the General Theory of Crime in Thailand

Author: Kerley, Kent R1; Xu, Xiaohe; Sirisunyaluck, Bangon1 Department of Justice Sciences, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61707005?accountid=14925

Abstract: Gottfredson and Hirschi's (1990) treatise on low self-control has been the subject of much debate and empirical testing. Although the theory was developed as an explanation for criminal offending, researchers have examined recently whether low self-control may increase the risk of criminal victimization. This study contributes to the literature by (1) simultaneously assessing the effects of low self-control on offending and victimization, (2) focusing on psychological and physical intimate partner abuse in the family context, and (3) using a cross-cultural dataset. We utilize Tobit regression to test the impact of low self-control on intimate partner aggression and victimization in a sample of 794 married females residing in Bangkok, Thailand. Results provide a more thorough understanding of self-control theory and intimate partner abuse in a cross-cultural context. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence Shelters as Prevention Agents for HIV/AIDS?

Author: Rountree, Michele A; Pomeroy, Elizabeth C; Marsiglia, Flavio F

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61433631?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article reports findings from a pilot study of 21 domestic violence shelters in a southwestern state in the United States. The survey instrument included descriptive information on shelter service delivery. Specifically, questions were asked about the practice of assessing a client's risk of HIV/AIDS, the provision of HIV/AIDS educational and prevention programs within shelters, and information about organizational characteristics that facilitate or impede the existence of these services. The findings suggest that shelters lacked sufficient HIV/AIDS policies and programs to respond to their client's heightened risk of infection. Although 19 (90.5 percent) of the shelters reported that they routinely ask about their clients' sexual abuse histories, there was no link between a woman's disclosure of sexual abuse and a subsequent provision of appropriate HIV/AIDS services (referrals for testing, treatment) by the shelter. HIV/AIDS awareness was high among the shelter staff who responded to the survey, but HIV/AIDS prevention and education were practically nonexistent. Implications for social work practice are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence among Married Women in Kenya

Author: Djamba, Yanyi K1; Kimuna, Sitawa R1 Auburn University Montgomery, USA ydjamba@aum.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61786863?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the prevalence and determinants of physical, sexual, and life threatening partner violence experienced by married women, using the 2003 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey data. We found that 40 percent of respondents have ever been abused by their husbands. Physical abuse was the most common form of abuse (36%) followed by sexual (13%) and life threatening (6%) abuses. Logistic regression results show significant effects of gender-power factors on each of the three dimensions of abuse. However, ethnicity is the most significant variable, suggesting that cultural norms play a major role in gender relations and wife abuse in Kenya.

Intimate Partner Violence and Children' s Reaction to Peer Provocation: The Moderating Role of Emotion Coaching

Author: Katz, Lynn Fainsilber1; Hunter, Erin; Klowden, Amanda1 Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Box 351525, Seattle, WA 98195 katzlf@u.washington.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61684502?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study examined the relation between intimate partner violence (IPV) and children' s reactions to a stressful peer interaction in a community-based sample. The moderating role of parental emotion coaching in buffering children from negative reactions to a peer was also examined. Children participated in a peer provocation paradigm and mothers completed the Parent Meta-Emotion Interview. Both adaptive (i.e., laughing, ignoring) and maladaptive (i.e., hostile/challenging, odd behaviors) reactions to the provocative peer were examined. IPV was positively related to children' s laughing and odd behaviors but was unrelated to ignoring and hostile/challenging behaviors. Additionally, emotion coaching was found to moderate relations between IPV and children' s laughing and odd behaviors. The importance of understanding protective factors in families experiencing IPV and of developing emotion coaching parenting programs is discussed.

Abstract: The current descriptive study seeks to broaden empirical understanding about family violence by comparing women's reports of their male partner's controlling behaviors in samples of women in a domestic violence offender's program (N = 77) and women in a domestic violence shelter (N = 77). Three interesting findings were noted. First, the majority of women in the IPV offender's program reported their male partner committed some frequency of physical abuse (84.4%), emotional abuse (85.6%) and/or overall controlling behaviors (96.4%). However, the majority of the women in the IPV offender's program reported the frequency of these behaviors occurred 'rarely' (53.2%, 36.4%, and 55.8% respectively). Second, the partners of women charged with intimate partner violence are significantly less violent and controlling than the partners of women seeking refuge in the shelter. Finally, it appears that women IPV offenders report experiencing three distinct categories of partner initiated violent and controlling experiences. Practical, theoretical, and research implications are addressed.

Quality of Maternal Parenting among Intimate-Partner Violence Victims Involved with the Child Welfare System

Abstract: Children are overrepresented in households with intimate-partner violence (IPV), and many suffer the double burden of being the subject of maltreatment and bearing the consequences of abuse to their mothers. Despite this situation, little information exists concerning parenting by women who have been abused by an intimate partner. We examine the relationship between women's experiences with IPV and the quality of maternal parenting using data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being. The sample consisted of 1,943 female caregivers of children younger than 10 years investigated for child maltreatment. Women who had experienced IPV in the past but were no longer victims of IPV had significantly better parenting scores than women who were currently experiencing IPV, when other risk factors were controlled. This study adds to the evidence that IPV does not necessarily impair maternal parenting. Women abused by an intimate partner deserve a thorough assessment of what services they need: parenting services should be offered as warranted on a case-by-case evaluation of the particular woman's parenting skills.

Attitudes Toward Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Moscow, Russia

Author: Stickley, Andrew1; Kislitsyna, Olga; Timofeeva, Irina; Vagero, Denny1 Stockholm Center on Health of Societies in Transition (SCOHOST), Sodertorns hogskola, S 141 89, Huddinge, Sweden andrew.stickley@sh.se

Abstract: This study examines attitudes towards violence against women among the populace in Moscow, Russia using data drawn from the Moscow Health Survey. Information was obtained from 1,190 subjects (510 men and 680 women) about their perceptions of whether violence against women was a serious problem in contemporary Russia, and under what circumstances they thought it was justifiable for a husband to hit his wife. Less than half the respondents thought violence was a serious problem, while for a small number of interviewees there were several scenarios where violence was regarded as being permissible against a wife. Being young, divorced or widowed, having financial difficulties, and regularly consuming alcohol were associated with attitudes more supportive of violence amongst men; having a low educational level underpinned supportive attitudes among both men and women. Results are discussed in terms of the public reemergence of patriarchal attitudes in Russia in the post-Soviet period. Adapted from the source document.

Gender-Role Implications on Same-Sex Intimate Partner Abuse

Author: Brown, Carrie11 Counseling Psychology, University of Kentucky, 3650 Tates Creek Rd Apt 111, Lexington, KY 40517, USA clbrown@naz.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61664409?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examines sociocultural factors that influence how same-sex intimate partner violence is viewed, studied, reported and treated, with a specific focus on the effects of gender-role socialization and heterosexism. Further it summarizes the similarities and differences experienced by heterosexual and same-sex couples in order to provide a framework for understanding the unique factors that must be considered when working with this population. It also explores how gender-role socializations and heterosexism create and enforce stigmas and obstacles for validation and reporting of this abuse. The exacerbation of same-sex partner abuse by the dominant and sexual minority culture is addressed and problems that exist within the legal system are highlighted. Issues created by the power dynamics of intersecting identities (race, socioeconomic status, age, disability, sexual orientation) and minority stress are discussed. Suggestions for supportive legislation and implications for helping professionals are provided. Adapted from the source document.

From Victim to Offender: The Effects of Male Initiated Violence on Women Arrested for Using Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Simmons, Catherine A1; Lehmann, Peter; Collier-Tenison, Shannon1 College of Social Work, University of Tennessee, 711 Jefferson Ave, Room 605, Memphis, TN 38163, USA cathysimmons@utk.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61431149?accountid=14925

Abstract: A number of theorists posit that most women who are arrested for using violence against their intimate partners are in-fact victims of IPV themselves and should be treated as such. However, in this population of women IPV arrestees empirical investigation has yet to explore how physical and emotional victimization experiences are associated with arrest related factors, propensity to be abusive or attitude toward using relationship violence. The current study explores these factors finding no difference in arrest factors between women who (a) deny abuse, (b) report rare/occasional abuse and (c) report frequent/very frequent abuse. However, mixed results were found with regard to participants' responses on scales measuring propensity to be abusive and attitudes about using violence in marriage. Theoretical and practical related issues are addressed. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence, Psychological Distress, and Suicidality: A Path Model Using Data from African American Women Seeking Care in an Urban Emergency Department

Author: Leiner, Amy S; Compton, Michael T1; Houry, Debra; Kaslow, Nadine J1 Emory University School of Medicine, 49 Jesse Hill Jr. Drive, S.E., Room #333, Atlanta, GA, 30303, USA, Michael.Compton@emory.edu

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) and suicidal behavior are major public health problems in the African American community. This study investigated whether or not IPV and suicidal ideation are correlated in urban African American women, and if the IPV-suicidal ideation link is explained by symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). With 323 abused African American females, path analysis revealed that: (1) IPV arrow right depressive symptoms arrow right suicidal ideation, and (2) IPV arrow right PTSD symptoms arrow right depressive symptoms arrow right suicidal ideation. When evaluating abused women, depressive and PTSD symptoms and suicidal thoughts must be assessed. Interventions for reducing suicidal behavior in abused, low income African American women should reduce symptoms of depression and PTSD.

Parent-Child Interaction Therapy with Domestic Violence Populations

Author: Borrego, Joaquin, Jr1; Gutow, Mindy R; Reicher, Shira; Barker, Chikira H1 Department of Psychology, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX 79409-2051, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61687311?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence continues to be a significant social problem impacting our society. Battered women and their children experience a myriad of negative consequences as a result of domestic violence. Of the possible negative sequelae that mothers and children experience, the disrupted parent-child relationship has received relatively little attention in the literature. Though psychosocial interventions are available to treat women who experience violence and children who witness violence, few interventions focus on the parent-child relationship. This article describes parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT), a relationship-based intervention. Although not initially developed to treat domestic violence, PCIT has unique characteristics that make it a promising intervention with this population. A rationale for the use of PCIT with battered women and their children is presented. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Victim and Perpetrator Characteristics Among Couples in the United States

Author: Caetano, Raul1; Vaeth, Patrice AC; Ramisetty-Mikler, Suhasini1 University of Texas Houston School of Public Health, 6011 Harry Hines Blvd. Room V8.112, Dallas, TX, 75390-9128, USA, Raul.Caetano@UTSouthwestern.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811292961?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper describes the characteristics (sociodemographic, drinking and selected psychological attributes) of victims, perpetrators and those who engage in mutual intimate partner violence (IPV) among couples in the U.S. Subjects constitute a multistage area probability sample representative of married and cohabiting couples from the 48 contiguous United States. Results indicate that age is the only variable that appears to have a consistent effect for men and women and across violence-related statuses: Older individuals are less likely to be victims, perpetrators and less likely to be involved in mutually violent relationships. Other variables such as ethnicity, marital status, drinking, impulsivity, depression and powerlessness are either gender or status-specific in their ability to predict victimization, perpetration or victimization/perpetration. Overall, those involved in violent relationships do not appear to be very different from those not involved in violent relationships. The most likely reason for lack of this difference is the nature of IPV in general population samples, which is in most cases moderate.

Intimate Partner Violence Among Adolescent and Young Adult Mothers

Author: Leaman, Suzanne C1; Gee, Christina B1 Department of Psychology, The George Washington University, 2125 G St., NW, Washington, DC 20052, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61664895?accountid=14925

Abstract: The associations between intimate partner violence (IPV) and mental health among adolescent and young adult mothers were compared. The sample was drawn from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study and participants were 672 mothers between the ages of 14 and 21. IPV was significantly positively associated with both depression and anxiety among young adult mothers. However, these associations were not found among adolescent mothers. In addition, IPV and marital status were significantly related among young adult mothers, but not adolescent mothers. Results suggest that IPV may have different consequences during different parts of the life course, or that mental health symptoms may be reported only later in life.

Predictors of Attitudes Toward Intimate Partner Violence: A Comparative Study of Men in Zambia and Kenya

Author: Lawoko, Stephen11 Karolinska Institute

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61702062?accountid=14925

Abstract: Attitudes toward intimate partner violence (IPV) were compared between Zambian and Kenyan men on sociodemographic, attitudinal, and structural predictors of such attitudes. Data were retrieved from the latest Demographic and Health Surveys in each country. The results showed that many men in Zambia (71%) and Kenya (68%) justified IPV to punish a woman for transgression from normative domestic roles. In priority order, sociodemographic, autonomy, and access-to-information indicators predicted attitudes toward IPV in both countries. Whereas in Kenya, education reduced the likelihood of justifying IPV, the reverse was observed in Zambia. Access to information reduced the likelihood of justifying IPV among men in Zambia but not in Kenya. Men's positive attitudes toward women's autonomy reduced the likelihood of justifying IPV in Kenya but not in Zambia. Differences in specific predictors between the countries demonstrate the significance of capitalizing on need-adapted interventions tailored to fit conditions in each country.

A 16-Year Examination of Domestic Violence Among Asians and Asian Americans in the Empirical Knowledge Base. A Content Analysis

Author: Yick, Alice G1; Oomen-Early, Jody1 Capella University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809497019?accountid=14925

Abstract: Until recently, research studies have implied that domestic violence does not affect Asian American and immigrant communities, or even Asians abroad, because ethnicity or culture has not been addressed. In this content analysis, the authors examined trends in publications in leading scholarly journals on violence relating to Asian women and domestic violence. A coding schema was developed, with two raters coding the data with high interrater reliability. Sixty articles were published over the 16 years studied, most atheoretical and focusing on individual levels of analysis. The terms used in discussing domestic violence reflected a feminist perspective. Three quarters of the studies were empirical, with most guided by logical positivism using quantitative designs. Most targeted specific Asian subgroups (almost a third focused on Asian Indians) rather than categorizing Asians as a general ethnic category. The concept of 'Asian culture' was most often assessed by discussing Asian family structure. Future research is discussed in light of the findings.

Coping as a Mediator and Moderator Between Intimate Partner Violence and Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression

Author: Calvete, Esther1; Corral, Susana; Estevez, Ana1 University of Deusto

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61707722?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the role of coping as both a moderator and a mediator of the association between intimate partner violence and women's mental health. A sample of 298 women who had suffered physical aggression completed measures of physical and psychological abuse, coping responses, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Tests of moderation consistently indicated that coping responses did not moderate the impact of intimate partner violence on symptoms of anxiety and depression, whereas tests of mediation demonstrated that disengagement coping mediated the impact of psychological abuse on distress. Thus, findings support the hypothesis that coping responses are influenced by violence itself and underline the dysfunctional nature of disengagement coping among victims.

Associations of child maltreatment and intimate partner violence with psychological adjustment among low SES, African American children

Author: Kaslow, Nadine J1; Thompson, Martie P1 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Grady Health System, Emory University School of Medicine, 80 Jesse Hill Jr Drive, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61419551?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: This study assessed the unique and interactive effects of child maltreatment and mothers' physical intimate partner violence (IPV) status on low-SES African American children's psychological functioning. Methods: Mothers were recruited from a large, inner-city hospital, and those who met eligibility criteria were asked to complete a lengthy face-to-face interview while their child was assessed separately but concurrently. The sample included 152 mother-child dyads. The children's mean age was 10 years, and 45% were male. Multivariate linear regression analyses tested the main and interactive effects of child maltreatment and mothers' exposure to physical IPV on children's psychological functioning (internalizing and externalizing symptoms, traumatic stress symptoms), while controlling for covariates. Results: Children who experienced child maltreatment and children whose mothers experienced physical IPV had higher levels of psychological distress than their respective counterparts. Post hoc analysis of significant interaction effects indicated that child maltreatment was associated with internalizing and externalizing problems and traumatic stress only when mothers reported higher levels of physical IPV. This finding did not hold true for youth whose mothers did not acknowledge elevated rates of physical IPV. Conclusions: African American youth from low-SES backgrounds who are maltreated and whose mothers experience physical IPV are at particularly high risk for psychological distress. Targeted prevention and intervention programs are needed for these poly-victimized youth. [Copyright 2008 Elsevier Ltd.]

A Solution-Focused Intervention with a Youth in a Domestic Violence Situation: Longitudinal Evidence

Author: Georgiades, Savvas Daniel11 School of Social Work, Saint Ambrose University, McMullen Hall, 518 West Locust, Davenport, IA 52803, USA GeorgiadesSavvasD@sau.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61407611?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports on a 4-year therapeutic intervention combining in-person and email communication with a 13-year-old Greek-Cypriot teenager who witnessed and later was the victim of severe domestic violence. The intervention is based on an empowerment philosophy and solution-focused strategies, and its usefulness is evaluated by three standardized measures at five time points between the years 1999 and 2003. Pertinent cultural and ethical dynamics of the interventional context are highlighted. The intervention may have helped to produce better perpetrator-youth relations, remission of the client's depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms, and improvement in his academic performance. Implications and limitations are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Cansocial workers and police be partners when dealing with bikie-gang related domestic violence and sexual assault?

Author: Cooper, Lesley1; Anaf, Julia; Bowden, Margaret1 School of Social Administration and Social Work, Flinders University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61443947?accountid=14925

Abstract: Welfare and criminal justice systems manifest different goals, cultures, values and working methods. In Australia, the welfare sector has a culture of empowerment and concern for victims' rights, within which social workers focus on social justice and social change. In contrast, the criminal justice sector (police) is patriarchal and para-military in structure, focusing on enforcing and maintaining community order and safety. These differences can create tension when social workers and police need to work as partners in response to violence against women, in particular violence against women from bike gangs. This article addresses the issue of partnerships between social workers and police when working with abused bike-gang women. It presents the findings of recent research into social work practice with such women in South Australia, in conjunction with a brief exploration of the international literature on social work and police cultures, and partnerships. It concludes that whilst there is a great need for genuine collaboration and partnership between social workers and police in the complex context of domestic violence with links to organised crime, the cultures and mandates of these different professions make this difficult. Adapted from the source document.

Welfare Indignities: Homeless Women, Domestic Violence, and Welfare Reform in San Francisco

Author: Roschelle, Anne R11 Department of Sociology, State University of New York, I Hawk Drive, Jacobson Faculty Tower, 516 A, New Paltz, NY 12561, USA roschela@newpaltz.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61716739?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using data collected during a 4 year ethnography, this paper examines how the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) has impacted homeless women in San Francisco who are also victims of domestic violence. Specifically this paper looks at how the behavior of abusive men prevents homeless women from successfully navigating the new welfare-to-work requirements and maintaining stable employment. Findings indicate that despite the discourse touting the success of welfare reform, the 1996 PRWORA has further disenfranchised an already devastated population systematically forcing them further onto the margins of society.

Inching forward on domestic violence: the 'co-ordinated community response' and putting it in practice in Cheshire

Author: Hague, Gill1; Bridge, Sue1 Violence against Women Research Group, School for Policy Studies, University of Bristol, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61702018?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence against women is at the sharp end of gender oppression. In combating domestic violence specifically, 'co-ordinated community responses' are now widely recognised as the best way forward, bringing together all relevant organisations to build pro-active, preventative projects with the key involvement of women's domestic violence services. The Cheshire Domestic Abuse Partnership in the UK is conducting pioneering work along these lines. From 2000 to 2003, this project was funded and evaluated through the Home Office Crime Reduction Programme. This paper builds on the material from the evaluation, supplemented with an analysis of recent developments until 2007 which have maintained the initiative at the forefront of domestic abuse work. Thus, the article is a discussion paper, rather than an evaluation report (available elsewhere). Using a gender analysis of power and control to understand domestic abuse, the Cheshire project melds together data monitoring, improved policing, training, outreach to abuse survivors, and domestic violence projects in schools, in an active mix under mature multi-agency leadership. Its central focus, deriving from the principles of the women's activist movement, is the empowerment of abused women. The Cheshire initiative has much to teach us about how to move forward in making women's and children's lives safer. Adapted from the source document.

The Relationship Between Domestic Violence and Animal Abuse: An Australian Study

Author: Volant, Anne M1; Johnson, Judy A; Gullone, Eleonora; Coleman, Grahame J1 Monash University, Clayton, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61735932?accountid=14925

Abstract: Several North American studies have found a connection between domestic violence and animal abuse. This article reports on the first Australian research to examine this connection. A group of 102 women recruited through 24 domestic violence services in the state of Victoria and a nondomestic violence comparison group (102 women) recruited from the community took part in the study. Significantly higher rates of partner pet abuse, partner threats of pet abuse, and pet abuse by other family members were found in the violent families compared with the nondomestic violence group. As hypothesized, children from the violent families were reported by their mothers to have witnessed and committed significantly more animal abuse than children from the nonviolent families. Logistic regression analyses revealed, for the group as a whole, that a woman whose partner had threatened the pets was 5 times more likely to belong to the intimate partner violence group.

Gender Differences in Specialization in Intimate Partner Violence: Comparing the Gender Symmetry and Violent Resistance Perspectives

Author: Bouffard, Leana A; Wright, Kevin A; Muftic, Lisa R

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61782476?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on male domestic violence offenders has typically considered them to be highly specialized offenders, and specialized theories and policies have been developed to address this type of offending. Some scholars have suggested that intimate partner violence is not as specialized as has been previously assumed. Especially in terms of gender differences, intimate partner violence research and theory suggest some variability in the level of specialization apparent for offenders. The current study uses the gender symmetry and violent resistance perspectives of women's use of intimate partner violence to examine gender differences in specialization among a sample of intimate partner violence arrestees. Analyses employed multivariate models estimating the diversity index as a measure of specialization in general and multilevel item response theory to assess specialization in intimate partner violence specifically. Results indicate that female arrestees demonstrate significantly greater levels specialization as compared to male arrestees, providing support for the violent resistance perspective. Implications of these results and directions for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence, Contraceptive Use, and Unwanted Pregnancy in Rural India

Author: Stephenson, Rob1; Koenig, Michael A; Acharya, Rajib; Roy, Tarun K1 Hubert Department of Global Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, 1518 Clifton Road, NE, Atlanta, GA, 30322

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61682863?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between male-to-female physical domestic violence and unwanted pregnancy among women in three economically and culturally diverse areas of India. A central methodological focus of the study is the examination of retrospective and prospective measures of pregnancy unwantedness, contrasting their usefulness for specifying levels of unwanted pregnancy and its relationship with domestic violence. Data from India's 1998-99 National Family Health Survey and a 2002-03 follow-up survey for which women in four states were reinterviewed are analyzed, and the factors associated with the intersurvey adoption of contraception and the experience of an unwanted pregnancy are examined. Women who experience physical violence from their husbands are significantly less likely to adopt contraception and more likely to experience an unwanted pregnancy. A prospectively measured indicator of unwanted pregnancy identifies a higher prevalence of unwanted pregnancies than do the traditionally employed retrospective measures and is more successful in establishing a relationship between unwanted pregnancies and domestic violence. The results demonstrate a clear relationship between a woman's experience of physical violence from her husband and her ability to achieve her fertility intentions. The need to improve the measurement of pregnancy intendedness is clear, and a move toward using prospective measures as the standard is necessary. Adapted from the source document.

Remaking Self after Domestic Violence: Mongolian and Australian Women's Narratives of Recovery

Author: Oke, Marion

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612336?accountid=14925

Abstract: My feminist, narrative research comprises a crosscultural narrative analysis of 11 Mongolian & 11 Australian women's stories of survival, recovery & remaking of self, following intimate partner violence. With a major focus on narrative identity, the research process involved me as researcher, as well as the participants themselves, bearing witness to & reflecting on their stories. While similarities between the Mongolian & Australian stories stood out above differences, there was some evidence that the Mongolian women had moved further away from the violence & its effects than their Australian counterparts. Perhaps the cohesive nature of the Mongolian women's family supports strengthened their narrative identities, enabling their greater resilience. References. Adapted from the source document.

Substance Abuse Issues Among Women in Domestic Violence Programs: Findings From North Carolina

Author: Martin, Sandra L1; Moracco, Kathryn E; Chang, Judy C; Council, Carol L; Dulli, Lisa S1 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61728428?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article discusses the results of a survey of North Carolina domestic violence programs that found that substance abuse problems are common among program clients, yet only half of the programs had policies concerning substance-abusing clients, and one fourth had memoranda of agreement with substance abuse treatment providers. Most programs with shelters asked clients about substance use; however, one third of the shelters would not admit women if they were noticeably under the influence of substances while seeking shelter residence, instead referring them to substance abuse programs. Approximately one tenth of the domestic violence programs did not have any staff or volunteers with training in substance abuse issues. Implications are discussed.

Consequences of Teen Dating Violence: Understanding Intervening Variables in Ecological Context

Author: Banyard, Victoria L1; Cross, Charlotte1 University of New Hampshire

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61706235?accountid=14925

Abstract: Increasing attention has been given to the problem of teen dating violence with more research needed on mediating and moderating factors in the relationship between victimization and negative consequences. This article explores mental health and educational consequences of physical and sexual abuse by peers in a convenience sample of adolescents. Dating violence was associated with higher levels of depression, suicidal thoughts, and poorer educational outcomes. The use of alcohol and depression complicated the relationship between victimization and outcomes. Sex differences in patterns of perceived social support as a moderator were also examined with more significant effects for girls.

Propensity for Intimate Partner Abuse and Workplace Productivity: Why Employers Should Care

Author: Rothman, Emily F1; Corso, Phaedra S1 Boston University School of Public Health

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61674840?accountid=14925

Abstract: It has been demonstrated that intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization is costly to employers, but little is known about the economic consequences associated with employing perpetrators. This study investigated propensity for partner abuse as a predictor of missed work time and on-the-job decreases in productivity among a small sample of male employees at a state agency (N = 61). Results suggest that greater propensity for abusiveness is positively associated with missing work and experiencing worse productivity on the job, controlling for level of education, income, marital status, age, and part-time versus full-time employment status. Additional research could clarify whether IPV perpetration is a predictor of decreased productivity among larger samples and a wider variety of workplace settings. Employers and IPV advocates should consider responding to potential IPV perpetrators through the workplace in addition to developing victim-oriented policies and prevention initiatives.

Incorporation rather than recovery: Living with the legacy of domestic violence

Author: Evans, Ilsa1; Lindsay, Jo1 Centre for Women's Studies & Gender Research, School of Political and Social Inquiry, Monash University, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61780170?accountid=14925

Abstract: Synopsis: Concepts of recovery dominate academic and popular understandings of the post-relationship experiences of survivors of domestic violence. However, we argue that using a recovery framework may be problematic and ultimately counter-productive whereas the concept of incorporation is better for understanding the experiences of survivors of domestic violence. This argument is based on an in-depth study of 134 survivors of domestic violence at least 12months after leaving the abusive relationship in Melbourne, Australia. 134 women participated in a survey and 48 women took part in additional follow-up interviews. Recovery is unlikely because the effects of domestic violence usually continue to impact on the lives of survivors particularly where ongoing contact with perpetrators is necessary. We discuss the implications of using the concept of incorporation instead of recovery for academics, service providers and ultimately for survivors themselves. [Copyright 2008 Elsevier Ltd.]

Psychosocial Factors Associated with Reports of Physical Dating Violence Victimization among U.S. Adolescent Males

Author: Howard, Donna E1; Wang, Min Qi; Yan, Fang1 Department of Public and Community Health, University of Maryland CHHP, 2387 Valley Drive, College park, MD 20742 dhoward1@umd.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61678070?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study, based upon the national 2005 Youth Risk Behavior Survey of U.S. high school students, provides the most current and representative data on physical dating violence among adolescent males (N = 6,528) The dependent variable was physical dating violence. The independent variables included four dimensions: violence, suicide, substance use, and sexual risk behavior. Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were examined followed by multivariate logistic regression analyses, which included all significant independent variables from the bivariate analyses. Adjusted OR and 95% CI were computed to assess the significance of the relationships. In terms of prevalence, 10.0% of male adolescents reported experiencing physical dating violence. Boys who reported sad/hopeless feelings (OR = 2.42), physical fighting (OR = 1.92), gun carrying (OR = 1.80), recent sexual partners (OR = 2.84), or unprotected sexual intercourse (OR = 1.81), were more likely to report physical dating violence. These findings suggest that dating violence against adolescent males is sufficiently widespread and clusters with other risk factors, and that further research and intervention efforts be directed toward better understanding and preventing both male victimization and its psychosocial sequalae. Adapted from the source document.

Intergenerational Transmission of Violence, Threatened Egoism, and Reciprocity: A Test of Multiple Psychosocial Factors Affecting Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Holt, Jessica L1; Gillespie, Wayne1 Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology, East Tennessee State University, Box 70555, Johnson City, TN 37614, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61702712?accountid=14925

Abstract: A myriad of factors have been advanced to explain intimate violence. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects on intimate violence of three specific concepts: threatened egoism, violence in the family of origin, and reciprocity. Self-report questionnaires were administered to a randomly selected cluster sample of 423 participants, 147 males and 276 females. While no support was found for threatened egoism, both violence witnessed in the family of origin and reciprocity were found to significantly influence intimate violence. Analyses conducted separately for males and females indicated that these factors operate differently based on gender. Adapted from the source document.

The Complexity of Trauma Types in the Lives of Women in Families Referred for Family Violence: Multiple Mediators of Mental Health

Author: Banyard, Victoria L; Williams, Linda M; Saunders, Benjamin E; Fitzgerald, Monica M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61356532?accountid=14925

Abstract: Responding to calls for further research about the impact of multiple types of trauma across the life span, this study examines the interconnections among types of trauma in childhood and adulthood in a convenience clinical sample of 283 women obtaining social services for family violence. In particular, variables including family of-origin dysfunction and other childhood risk factors, relationship victimization in adulthood, and the presence of adult resources were examined as mediators of links between child maltreatment and adult mental health symptoms. Variables were assessed at different time points, 3 years apart. Path analysis revealed that the conceptual model of multiple pathways between childhood family violence exposure and adult outcomes fit the data well. In particular, the link between child maltreatment and adult trauma symptoms was mediated by more proximal adult sexual and intimate partner violence and its association with childhood risk markers (e.g., negative family environment) and decreased markers of resources. This link was not significant for a more general index of mental health symptoms in adulthood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved).

The Role of Socioeconomic Status in Helpseeking from Hotlines, Shelters, and Police among a National Sample of Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Cattaneo, Lauren Bennett; DeLoveh, Heidi L M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397373?accountid=14925

Abstract: The role of socioeconomic status (SES) in the prevalence and course of intimate partner violence (IPV) has been established, but mechanisms of this role are less clear. An untested assumption has been that women of greater resources are better able to seek help. This study used a national sample of 1,077 women who had experienced IPV to explore the role of income and education in helpseeking from hotlines, shelters, and police. The authors found that SES did not play a large role in the use of hotlines, the least often used service in this study. Women with more income were less likely to use shelters and were less likely to feel they should have used them. There was an interaction between income and severity of violence in predicting police use, such that severity of violence only predicted calling police among higher income women. This finding suggests the possibility of a lower threshold for reporting violence among the lowest income women. The authors discuss the need for research using a more diverse sample of women, and the need to fine tune services according to our emerging understanding of social context.

State Gender Inequality, Socioeconomic Status and Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in India: A Multilevel Analysis

Author: Ackerson, Leland K; Subramanian, S V

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61436428?accountid=14925

Abstract: While a growing body of literature has investigated the health impact of intimate partner violence (IPV), less has been written on the social determinants of IPV. The authors use multilevel modeling methods to analyze data from a sample of 83,627 women in India to examine the socioeconomic & demographic patterning of the state- & neighborhood-level variation in, & the state- &/or neighborhood-level characteristics related to, IPV. This study finds social gradients in IPV in which women who are uneducated, from marginalized castes, & living in poor households have higher likelihood of reporting IPV than those living in advantaged circumstances. The results also show differences in IPV between neighborhoods & between states that are partially explained by state levels of gender inequality. The results suggest that changing cultural norms to promote the status of women & increasing the educational & economic opportunities for all people could decrease the prevalence of IPV.

Rates and psychological effects of exposure to family violence among Sri Lankan university students

Author: Haj-Yahia, Muhammad M1; de Zoysa, Piyanjli1 Paul Baerwald School of Social Work and Social Welfare, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mt. Scopus, Jerusalem 91905, Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61715913?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objectives The study had two objectives: to examine the rates of exposure to family violence among students in a non-Western society, with Sri Lanka as a case study and to examine the psychological effects of their exposure. Method Four hundred seventy six medical students in Sri Lanka were surveyed. A self-administered questionnaire was utilized, which included two forms of the Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS) to measure the extent to which the students witnessed interparental violence and experienced parental violence in childhood and adolescence. Additional instruments included the Trauma Symptom Checklist (TSC-33), which measures dissociation, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance, and the Family Functioning in Adolescence Questionnaire (FFAQ), which measures the students' perceptions of the functioning and environment in their families. Results Between 16% and 18% of the participants indicated that they had witnessed at least one act of interparental psychological aggression, and between 2% and 16% indicated that they had witnessed at least one act of interparental physical violence before the age of 18. Between 11% and 84% of the participants had experienced at least one act of parental psychological aggression, and between 2% and 22% had experienced at least one act of parental physical violence during childhood. Significant amounts of the variance in participants' dissociation, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance were explained by their witnessing interparental violence and experiencing parental violence. Conclusions The present study provides strong evidence that the rates of family violence in a non-Western society (i.e., Sri Lankan families) are within the range of violence found in Western societies. In addition, the psychological effects of exposure to family violence in non-Western societies are similar to those in Western societies, although the relevance of familial, cultural, and political contexts as well as socio-demographic characteristics to those effects in non-Western societies should be taken into consideration. Practice implications Counseling centers at universities should focus on developing better routine screening to reach students who are victims of family violence. The importance of sensitivity to risks associated with asking students about these problems should be taken into consideration. Interventions should aim to increase the students' safety, to alleviate the mental health consequences of their exposure to family violence, and to help those victims to develop productive help-seeking behaviors and coping resources to ensure their safety. Collaboration between the university and community and within the university for the benefit of those victims may help in facilitating the identification of and intervention with students' victims of family violence.

Toward a Model for Engaging Latino Lay Ministers in Domestic Violence Intervention

Author: Hancock, Tina U; Ames, Natalie

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61373537?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is growing recognition that culturally relevant interventions with Latino couples experiencing domestic violence must take place at the community level as well as through clinically-oriented services. This article examines structural and cultural issues related to domestic violence among Latino immigrants living in rural areas of the United States. The authors present a culturally appropriate, environmentally- based model for domestic violence intervention and prevention with rural Latino families. The model identifies Latino church leaders as a potential resource in rural communities and calls upon social workers to collaborate with and support church leaders in preventing and intervening in domestic violence in rural Latino communities.

Change in Treatment Has No Relationship With Subsequent Re-Offending in U.K. Domestic Violence Sample: A Preliminary Study

Author: Bowen, Erica1; Gilchrist, Elizabeth; Beech, Anthony R1 Coventry University, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61427827?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this study, data is presented from a sample of 52 male domestic violence offenders who were court mandated to attend a profeminist psycho-educational rehabilitation program in the West Midlands. The extent of both statistically and clinically significant psychological change achieved across a variety of measures (pro-domestic-violence attitudes, anger, locus of control, interpersonal dependency) assessed pre- and post-treatment, and their association with post-treatment re-offending within an 11-month follow-up period is examined. The results indicate that program completers achieved limited significant psychological change. However, the level of psychological change achieved had no association with re-offending.

Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in Zambia: An Examination of Risk Factors and Gender Perceptions

Author: Klomegah, Roger Y11 Department of Sociology, Fayetteville State University, 1200 Murchison Road, Fayetteville, North Carolina 28301, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61719329?accountid=14925

Abstract: Abuse of women has reached epidemic proportions in Africa and the literature has revealed that, internationally, between 10% and 52% of women experience this phenomenon. This study examines some social risk factors associated with wife abuse, as well as gender perceptions of wife beating in Zambia, East Africa. Using the 2001/02 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey data, married women, age 15-49, were selected for analysis (N = 4731). The dependent variable in the study is wife abuse and explanatory variables are age, education, employment status, place of residence, beliefs about wife beating, and religion. The data show that more wives than husbands are likely to justify wife-beating under various circumstances with "going out without telling him" being the predominant belief for justifying beating. The data also revealed that in a multivariate context, wives with younger husbands, duration of marriage, place of residence, cultural beliefs about wife-beating, and membership in non-Orthodox religions are some of the risk factors that relate to intimate partner violence in Zambia. Implications of the study relate to strategies for dealing with this social problem, some of which are suggested in the paper. Adapted from the source document.

Family Trauma through Generations: Incest and Domestic Violence in Rural Sweden in the Nineteenth Century

Author: Drugge, Ulf11 Department of Human Sciences, University of Kalmar, Sweden

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61766317?accountid=14925

Abstract: Two generations of a family who lived in mid-nineteenth rural Sweden are described. Domestic violence was a common feature in the first generation family. The salient feature there was undoubtedly the incestuous father-daughter relationships. The way incest appeared in Sweden about 150 years ago, the role of local authorities, and the serious consequences to those victimized is analyzed with reference to both the cultural context of that time and to modern theories of incest. Seemingly puzzling violence committed by a second generation family member is related to the domestic violence in the previous generation. Due to the extraordinary character of the incest cases and the specific church council sessions in which the incest case was treated, aspects of family life normally hidden behind curtains of conventions were made public. Reaction patterns drawn from this case indicate a patriarchal system of oppression and badly-directed considerations. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

Intimate partner violence in Vietnam and among Vietnamese diaspora communities in western societies: A comprehensive review

Author: Taft, Angela J1; Small, Rhonda; Hoang, Kim A1 Mother and Child Health Research, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Victoria 2000 Tel: +61 3 8341 8571 a.taft@latrobe.edu.au

Abstract: Informal observations in Australian refuge/shelter services suggest that culturally and linguistically diverse women and children are over-represented in crisis rather than early intervention services. This observation includes Vietnamese women and children escaping intimate partner violence (IPV). There is limited research on the prevalence or characteristics of IPV in Vietnam or their diaspora that sheds light on the role played by immigration, acculturation, gender roles and other factors affecting Vietnamese victims' help-seeking strategies. Such knowledge can inform innovative responses to reduce IPV among Vietnamese families. We searched electronic databases and websites using keyword terms for 'intimate partner/family violence' and 'Vietnamese' The review found that Vietnamese victims and perpetrators share major similarities with those globally, especially the socio-economic determinants and sequelae of IPV However, immigration and refugee status confer particular stressors.

Problems in the system of mandatory reporting of children living with domestic violence

Author: Humphreys, Cathy11 Child and Family Welfare, Social Work at Melbourne, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia cathy.humphreys@unimelb.edu.au

Abstract: Historically, the chasm between services for women and services for children has been problematised in the domestic and family violence arena. However, this paper argues that it is now equally, or more problematic, that the recognition of harm to children in the context of domestic and family violence has 'grafted' statutory child protection response to intervention in this area. This paper argues that when judged against the criteria for a functional system, one which is effective, efficient, efficacious or ethical then there are a number of areas in which the child protection system fails in relation to children living with domestic violence. The paper raises three issues of particular concern: (a) responding to a widespread social problem through an individualised response at the tertiary end of provision; (b) undermining the voluntary and empowerment model of intervention for women through compulsory, statutory intervention with children; (c) creating a mandatory pathway to an intervention system which is not set up to work with an adult and child victim or intervene effectively with men who use violence.

Indigenous family violence and sexual abuse: Considering pathways forward

Abstract: Australian Indigenous experiences of family and sexual violence have received much media and government attention since 2006 Three state government reports into the problem have been published in this time. These reports highlighted the disproportionate incidence of sexual assault and family violence within Indigenous communities and the many complexities associated with such experiences. They also illustrated that Indigenous communities are actively considering pathways forward for healing and for justice for victims, their families, and the broader kin network who inevitably feel the ripple effects of such violence. Increasingly, international examples of pathways forward are being considered for their applicability in the Australian Indigenous context. This paper critically examines the international case study of the Community Holistic Circle Healing process developed by the community of Hollow Water, Canada. Australian Indigenous family violence reports since 1999 have identified this process as an example of best practice in the management of sexual violence in Indigenous communities and have recommended that similar such models and processes be considered for implementation in Australia. This paper critically examines the program in its own context and reflects on the feasibility of its transference into the very different geographic, social, cultural, political and spiritual contexts of Australian Indigenous communities.

An historical perspective on family violence and child abuse: Comment on Moloney et al, Allegations of Family Violence, 12 June 2007

Abstract: This comment discusses the historical development of social attitudes, social science research, and approaches in the justice system towards allegations of spousal and child abuse. Until relatively recently, victims of child abuse and spousal violence were largely ignored by the justice system, mental health professionals and social science researchers, and these victims rarely disclosed. In the late twentieth century, heavily influenced by feminist advocates and researchers, spousal violence and child sexual abuse were 'discovered'; there was growing understanding and support for victims, and a great increase in reporting of child and spousal violence. The increase in reporting by genuine victims was accompanied a less frequent but serious problem cases of false and exaggerated allegations. While a gendered basis analysis of issues of spousal and child abuse remains valuable, there is a need for development of more sophisticated and differentiated understandings of intimate partner violence and child abuse.

Family violence in children's cases under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth): Past practice and future challenges

Abstract: The issue of family violence poses one of the most significant challenges in making post-separation parenting arrangements. Australian Institute of Family Studies research on allegations of family violence in family law children's proceedings (Moloney et al 2007) has confirmed that under the previous family law framework, the issue of family violence was not dealt with effectively. This article examines the legal context for the report's findings in Part I and considers how family violence family will be dealt with under the new law system in Part II.

The idealised post-separation family in Australian family law: A dangerous paradigm for children in cases of domestic violence

Abstract: This article presents the findings of an in-depth discourse analysis of 20 First Instance unpublished judgments, delivered over a five-and-a-half-year period from one registry of the Family Court of Australia, in contested contact cases where the presence of domestic violence was acknowledged by the Court. A number of dominant themes from the judgments intersected to show how many judicial determinations about children's 'best interests' were underpinned by conservative values that emphasised the importance of the fathers' presence for children's future wellbeing and development. In most of the judgments analysed, the fathers' history of violence was readily excused or ignored, mothers were blamed for failing to support father-child contact, the voices of the children involved were often discounted and a dominant paradigm of the idealised post-separation family took precedence over the special needs of the children. There was little visible consideration of the potential or current effects of domestic violence on the children concerned. Adapted from the source document.

The rhetoric and reality of preventing family violence at the local governance level in Victoria, Australia

Abstract: This is an opportune time to review current policies and plans for responding to family violence in Australia. The recently elected Labor government has developed new promises and plans to respond to violence. Both the community sector and the various government tiers have used many terms to describe family violence, violence against women, community safety, and crime and violence. This article argues that the terms used matter for the formation, communication and implementation of policies and programs. In particular this article will explore how family violence prevention at the local governance is influenced by state and federal communications and policies. In the State of Victoria, Australia, local government-community partnerships have been key to engaging the whole community on women's issues and women's experiences of violence in the home by intimate partners and to the development of programs and projects that are innovative and responsive to local priorities and politics. But this work has occurred within a shifting and sometimes contradictory set of policies at the federal and state level. We have selected Maribyrnong as a case to highlight the relationship between state government rhetoric and funding, and local government responses to family violence. Adapted from the source document.

The invisibility of gendered power relations in domestic violence policy

Abstract: This exploratory study seeks to illustrate how the policy context shapes the way policy actors engage with concepts of gender and practices of racism. The paper draws on two case studies in the context of family and domestic violence (FDV) policy and service development in an Australian State Government context. The first case study uses document analysis of a major public inquiry into Government agency responses to FDV in Indigenous communities. The second uses a policy audit tool to examine a policy development process in a department responsible for coordinating human service agencies, services and funding of community-sector FDV projects. These case studies reveal that both Aboriginal women and non-Aboriginal women can disappear from the concerns that FDV policy purports to solve. To demonstrate our argument, we show how the policy terminology of both 'domestic violence' and that of 'family violence' can render gender and racism invisible. Adapted from the source document.

Baby lead the way: Mental health group work for infants, children and mothers affected by family violence

Abstract: 'Infant led' and 'child led' interventions designed to address the affects related to familial violence honour a 'child up', rather than a 'parent down' approach to dyadic work. The capacity to form healthy attachments is largely developed within early childhood. Relational disruption resulting from familial violence threatens to impair healthy attachments and the subsequent neurodevelopmental sequences involved in affect modulation.

Abstract: This paper describes a brief counseling intervention based on the readiness to change' concept for women experiencing intimate partner violence, and an educational program for training primary care health professionals in the delivery of such an intervention. We present a synthesis of the literature on the Transtheoretical Model of Behaviour and the Psychosocial Readiness to Change Model as applied to intimate partner violence. We describe the intervention used in the weave trial, which draws on the educational and partner violence literature, as well as integrating key theoretical insights from the field of behaviour change. Practical steps for training health professionals are outlined from the authors' experience and research.

Risk and Protective Factors for Recurrent Intimate Partner Violence in a Cohort of Low-Income Inner-City Women

Author: Sonis, Jeffrey1; Langer, Michelle1 Departments of Social Medicine and Family Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA jsonis@med.unc.edu

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to identify longitudinal predictors of any (versus no) episodes of recurrent intimate partner violence (IPV) and their severity among low-income inner-city women. A secondary analysis was conducted on data from an inception cohort of 321 previously abused women from the Chicago Women's Health Risk Study. In a multivariable logistic regression model, pregnancy, frequency of IPV in the year prior to the baseline interview, and the partner's use of power and control tactics increased the odds of recurrent IPV during the follow-up period and leaving an abusive partner reduced the odds. In a multivariate proportional odds logistic regression model, partner violence outside the home was associated with higher severity of recurrent IPV, but leaving an abusive partner was not. The results suggest that, for low-income women, leaving an abusive partner may reduce the risk of recurrent victimization without increasing severity of the recurrent attacks that do occur.

Predictors of Weapon Use in Domestic Violence Incidents Reported to Law Enforcement

Author: Kernsmith, Poco1; Craun, Sarah W1 Wayne State University, 4756 Cass Ave., Detroit, MI 48202, USA poco@wayne.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61706378?accountid=14925

Abstract: The study's aim was to determine the predictors of weapon use during domestic violence incidents that were reported to the police. Randomly selected cases (N=369) from the San Diego County Sheriff's department comprised the study sample. The predictor variables for weapon use included relationship type, relationship length, suspect drug or alcohol use, and restraining order status at the time of the attack. Suspect sex and race were included as control variables. A logistic regression demonstrated that victims who had restraining orders against the perpetrator were more likely to have a weapon used against them in a domestic violence incident. Suspect sex was significant in an unanticipated direction, with female perpetrators being more likely to use a weapon during a domestic violence incident. Adapted from the source document.

Childhood Sexual Abuse and Intimate Partner Violence among Women in Methadone Treatment: A Direct or Mediated Relationship?

Author: Engstrom, Malitta1; El-Bassel, Nabila; Go, Hyun; Gilbert, Louisa1 University of Chicago, 969 East 60th Street, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA, mve@uchicago.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811397765?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women in substance use treatment report rates of childhood sexual abuse and intimate partner violence that far exceed those reported by women in the general population. Previous research with nonrandom samples of women in substance use treatment suggests that there is a statistically significant relationship between childhood sexual abuse and intimate partner violence; however, little is known about the mechanisms of risk between these two public health concerns among this population of women. To address this gap in knowledge and to inform intervention strategies, this study examined direct and mediated relationships between childhood sexual abuse and intimate partner violence risk among a random sample of 416 women in methadone treatment. In addition to high rates of childhood sexual abuse (57.9%), intimate partner violence (lifetime prevalence, 89.7%; 6-month prevalence, 78.4%), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, 28.6%), and global psychological distress (19.5%), findings suggest that the relationship between childhood sexual abuse and intimate partner violence is mediated by mental health problems and that women experiencing PTSD or global psychological distress are 2.7 and 2.4 times more likely to experience intimate partner violence than women without such experiences, respectively. Although not a mediator in this relationship, financial independence reduced women's risk of partner violence by two-thirds. The paper includes discussion of social learning and stress and coping theories to explicate the findings and to inform intervention strategies.

Symptom Patterns among Youth Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Lang, Jason M1; Stover, Carla Smith1 Connecticut Center for Effective Practice, 270 Farmington Avenue, Suite 367, Farmington, CT 06032, USA jalang@uchc.edu

Abstract: Children and adolescents exposed to intimate partner violence display a broad range of symptoms. We sought to differentiate symptom patterns and predictors of these patterns using a person-oriented approach. Previous cluster analysis research of exposed youth was extended to include youth PTSD symptoms and trauma history. Participants were 74 mothers who had received a police call for domestic violence, and who had a child between 2 and 17 years old. Cluster analysis was used to identify four symptom patterns among exposed youth: Typical, Asymptomatic, General Distress, and Acute PTSD. These patterns were replicated in separate cluster analyses with younger and older participants. Symptom patterns were differentiated by maternal distress, maternal aggression, and youth trauma history, but not by male partner aggression. Implications for assessment and treatment of youth exposed to intimate partner violence, and suggestions for further research, are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Effects of Masculinity, Sex, and Control on Different Types of Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration

Author: Prospero, Moises11 University of Houston, Houston, TX, 77018, USA, moises.prospero@socwk.utah.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811373125?accountid=14925

Abstract: Controlling behaviors have been found to be a significant predictor in IPV perpetration (IPV) for both males and females. Studies have also revealed the relationship between IPV perpetration and masculinity among males; however, the literature has not investigated the relationship between masculinity and IPV perpetration among females. Additionally, studies have not explored the effects of controlling behaviors and masculinity on different types of IPV, such as physical and sexual perpetration. The present study investigated the relationship between controlling behaviors, masculinity, past victimization, and three types of IPV perpetration among 167 college students. Multivariate analyses revealed significant contributions of each factor varied according to the type of IPV perpetration (psychological, physical, and sexual). Implications from the results include the development of more inclusive violence prevention and intervention programs aimed addressing the perpetration of intimate partner violence.

Attitudes toward Domestic Violence in Korean and Vietnamese Immigrant Communities: Implications for Human Services

Author: Kim-Goh, Mikyong1; Baello, Jon1 Master of Social Work Program, California State University, Fullerton, 800 N. State College, Fullerton, CA 92834-6868, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61674727?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study examined the effects of gender, ethnicity, acculturation level, age, and education level of Korean and Vietnamese Americans on their attitudes toward domestic violence. The sample consisted of 229 Koreans and 184 Vietnamese, recruited from ethnic communities and college campuses in southern California. Participants completed a brief questionnaire, which included the Revised Attitudes toward Wife Abuse Scale (RAWA) and the Marin and Marin Acculturation Scale as well as demographic variables. Gender, education, and acculturation level emerged as significant predictors of attitudes toward domestic violence. More specifically, men as well as those who were less acculturated and less educated were more likely to endorse pro-violence attitudes. While there were no significant ethnic differences in the global attitude toward domestic violence between the two immigrant groups, there were specific inter-ethnic differences on select items of the RAWA scale. Adapted from the source document.

The Importance of Male Batters' Attributions in Understanding and Preventing Domestic Violence

Author: Wallach, Helene S1; Sela, Tsipi1 Department of Psychology, University of Haifa, Haifa, 31905, Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61677384?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present article reviews the literature regarding the importance of taking into account male batters' attributions in order to understand and to curtail their violence. Many treatment programs have been devised to stop domestic violence (DV); however, little comparative research exists. Therefore, we are unable to determine which techniques are effective and which are not. We contend that uncovering battering men's attributions is important in understanding DV, and specifically, that these attributions are the key to curtailing DV. We present a typology of battering men's attributions. What is common to these attribution styles is the evasion of responsibility for commission of, and for the need to take affirmative action to stop, the violence. These attribution styles have been found to increase battering men's hostility and stress, their risk for engaging in violent behavior, as well as enabling battering men to continue their violence unchecked. Therefore, attributions are a crucial ingredient in DV and must be addressed directly and intensely in DV treatment programs in order to increase their (as yet limited) effectiveness.

Leave or Stay?: Battered Women's Decision After Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Kim, Jinseok1; Gray, Karen A1 The University of South Carolina jinseokk@gwm.sc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61787502?accountid=14925

Abstract: Battered women's reasons for staying with or leaving their male partners are varied and complex. Using data from the Domestic Violence Experience in Omaha, Nebraska, a discrete-time hazard model was employed to examine a woman's decision based on four factors: financial independence, witness of parental violence, psychological factors, and the police response to the domestic violence call. Findings regarding the first three factors are consistent with previous findings. However, a negative police response did not deter a woman from leaving, which is a different finding from previous studies. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

Cultural Consensus and Cultural Diversity: A Mixed Methods Investigation of Human Service Providers' Models of Domestic Violence

Author: Collins, Cyleste C1; Dressler, William W1 Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/754039262?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study uses mixed methods and theory from cognitive anthropology to examine the cultural models of domestic violence among domestic violence agency workers, welfare workers, nurses, and a general population comparison group. Data collection and analysis uses quantitative and qualitative techniques, and the findings are integrated for interpretation. Findings reveal consensus among service providers on how controllable domestic violence factors are and whether they are most characteristic of victims or perpetrators, but diversity with regard to their understandings of the importance of the factors suggesting that occupational category alone is inadequate in predicting service providers' beliefs and subsequent delivery of services. The implications of the findings extend into the areas of domestic violence service delivery, cognitive anthropology, and mixed methods research.

Impact of Domestic Violence on the Workplace and Workers' Productivity in Selected Industries in Nigeria

Author: Ajala, E M11 Department of Social Work, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria majekajala@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61436301?accountid=14925

Abstract: The study examined impact of domestic violence (independent variable) on the workplace and workers' productivity (dependent variables) in Nigeria industries. The study is a survey research using an ex-post-facto type with a sample size of two hundred (200) participants selected form four industrial sectors within Ibadan metropolis of Oyo State. The age range of participants was between 25 and 50 with a mean of 30.5. The main instrument used to generate data for the study was a set of questionnaire with 0.85 reliability coefficient. Multiple regression analysis were used as tools of analysis. The results indicated that there is significant inference of domestic violence variables (physical, psychological and sexual abuse) on the performance of workers in industries. The independent variables taken together predicted the dependent variable by yielding a coefficient of multiple regression of 0.683 and a multiple regression square of 0.467. Thus the findings showed that domestic violence leads to absenteeism, loss of work time, high labour turnover and low productivity. It is further recommended that batterers should be empathized with in a non judgmental way and increases the safety of workplace so that victims can have the attention reduced; promote healthy living and projection of higher productivity within the establishment. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence: The Beginning, Continuation, or Final Act in a Criminal Career?

Author: Buzawa, Eve S1; Hirschel, David1 Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology, University of Massachusetts-Lowell, Lowell, Massachusetts, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612170?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper uses a life-course perspective to examine the extent to which domestic violence is part of a criminal career. Offenders who commit domestic violence as their first criminal act are compared to offenders for whom domestic violence is merely a continuation of a criminal career and for whom the domestic violence relationship provides an opportunity for the commission of still another type of offense. In addition, there is an examination of patterns in offending and reoffending for males and females. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Contraceptive Use in a Rural Indian Village

Author: Wilson-Williams, Lyndsey1; Stephenson, Rob; Juvekar, Sanjay; Andes, Karen1 Emory University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61742295?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study uses qualitative methods to examine how domestic violence affects the use of contraceptives by women in a rural village in India. The study highlights how multilevel factors are linked to a woman's ability to contracept and make fertility decisions in a context where being a wife implies obedience, limited mobility, sexual availability, and high fertility. The authors find that violence is normalized, or considered acceptable, if women do not adhere to expected gender roles. Although women's ability to make autonomous decisions is shown to be limited, the study explores covert strategies used to avoid pregnancy, which also tend to increase women's risk of experiencing domestic violence.

Training Adult Protective Services Workers About Domestic Violence: Training Needs and Strategies

Author: Payne, Brian K11 Georgia State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61670234?accountid=14925

Abstract: Many cases of elder abuse involve instances of partner abuse. In this study, attention is given to whether adult protective services supervisors think their workers know enough about specific aspects of domestic violence. Attention is also given to the strategies that the supervisors think would be most useful to teach about domestic violence. According to the supervisors, workers need to know more about intervening with perpetrators, planning for their own safety, and dealing with frustrations. The supervisors rated the importance of understanding theoretical perspectives as low. Results also show that agencies with domestic violence training policies participate in domestic violence training programs more often.

Power and Control as a Framework for Practice -- The Case of Intimate Partner Violence Work in Taiwan

Author: Julie Liu, Chu-Li1; Regehr, Cheryl1 Department of Social Work, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan (Julie Liu) and the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work, Sandra Rotman Chair, University of Toronto. chuli@thu.edu.tw

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612563?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study investigated the views of Taiwanese domestic violence workers regarding the applicability of Western feminist models of intervention in their work with battered women. The findings suggested that workers experienced discrepancies between their training in Western domestic violence practices and their work with Taiwanese women whose beliefs and culture were embedded with Confucian ideology. This study also found that workers had developed alternative strategies that they believed to be useful in working with these women. Implications for incorporating cultural knowledge into practice related to intimate partner violence are addressed. Adapted from the source document.

Chronic child abuse and domestic violence: children and families with long-term and complex needs

Author: Devaney, John

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61354247?accountid=14925

Abstract: It is estimated that up to one million children may have been exposed to domestic violence in the UK, with significant consequences for their social and emotional development in childhood and later life. At a time when the central and devolved administrations in the UK have developed strategies to tackle domestic violence, this paper reports the findings from a study conducted on children in the child protection system with long-term and complex needs as a result of experiencing domestic violence. The research identifies the characteristics of the children and their families and tracks their careers through the child protection system. The findings indicate that professionals have an awareness of domestic violence, and that younger children with younger parents are most likely to experience prolonged periods in the child protection system. Domestic violence in this context typically co-exists in families experiencing other difficulties such as substance misuse and socio-economic deprivation. In conclusion, the paper argues that Government policy and professional practice should primarily be concerned with assessing the risk that men present, rather than the risk that children are at. By reframing professional interventions, men are more likely to be challenged to accept responsibility for their behaviour and the consequences for their families.

Mothering in the context of domestic violence: the pervasiveness of a deficit model of mothering

Author: Lapierre, Simon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61383625?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite growing concerns with the situation of children exposed to domestic violence, and although women have been seen as central in the welfare of their children, limited attention has been paid to the issue of mothering in this context. This paper examines how concerns regarding abused women's mothering have been articulated in the academic literature on children's exposure to domestic violence, and argues that the dominant discourse in this area has been characterized by a deficit model of mothering. Implications of the pervasiveness of a deficit model for child welfare policies and practices are highlighted. Finally, this paper identifies key elements that should be considered in the development of a feminist perspective on mothering in the context of domestic violence, which could lead to less blaming and more supportive practices. Accepted for publication: May 2008. Adapted from the source document.

Melancholic mothering: mothers, daughters and family violence

Author: Kenway, Jane1; Fahey, Johannah1 Faculty of Education, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61714417?accountid=14925

Abstract: Through selected theories of melancholia, this paper seeks to shed some fresh interpretive light on the reproduction and disruption of gender, violence and family turmoil across generations of mothers and daughters. The originality of the paper lies in its exploratory deployment of theories of melancholia to consider issues of women, violence and generation. It addresses these matters through a discussion of the intergenerational emotional archives accumulated by two mother-daughter pairs in relation to their different experiences of sexual and other violence. It shares the mothers' experiences of violence in their childhood and shows how these help to shape the ways in which they raise their daughters and address the troubles that their daughters experience. Different theories of melancholia assist us to explain the dissimilar emotional dynamics between these mother and daughter pairs. But equally their stories suggest the analytical potential of different theories of melancholia for understanding women's and girls' diverse responses to violence. Freud's, Irigaray's and Silverman's constructions of melancholia, which are to some extent based on notions of emptiness, lack and insufficiency, are deployed alongside Eng and Kazanjian's interpretation of a melancholic state of being which focuses on the creative potential of animating the remains of loss; an interpretation that invokes an agential relationship to the losses that violence provokes. The former help to explain what Eng and Kazanjian might see as the 'hopeless politics' associated with certain melancholic responses to violence and the latter help to explain what they might consider more 'hopeful politics' associated with responses that mobilise a more agential relationship to loss. Although not subscribing to such a stark binary interpretation, we nonetheless argue for an analysis that acknowledges the different ways that the remains of loss are animated. The paper arises from a wider cross-generational study in Australia of the lives of educationally, economically and culturally marginalised young women and their mothers. Adapted from the source document.

Family Psychopathology and Perceived Stress of Both Domestic Violence and Negative Life Events as Predictors of Women's Mental Health Symptoms

Author: Mourad, Mariam R1; Levendosky, Alytia A; Bogat, GAnne; Eye, Alexander1 Michigan State University, Psychology Building, East Lansing, MI, 48824, USA, mouradma@msu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811385533?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using a diathesis-stress model, this study examined the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms in women who experience stressors of domestic violence (DV) and/or negative life events (NLEs) over the course of three years. Family history of affective mental health problems represented the diathesis. Using a person-oriented approach, 182 women were grouped into 6 risk profiles based on varying levels of DV and NLEs. Results showed that family history of psychopathology increased vulnerability to mental health disorders; however, the best predictor of symptoms was the presence of either stressor at any time. A quadratic relationship between the risk pattern and mental health symptoms indicated that fluctuations in depression were related to the pattern of stress experienced. Results support the diathesis-stress model for occurrence of depressive but not anxiety symptoms in women with DV and/or NLEs.

Intimate Partner Violence within the Chinese Community in San Francisco: Problem Gambling as a Risk Factor

Author: Liao, Michael S11 NICOS Chinese Health Coalition, 1208 Mason Street, San Francisco, CA, 94108, USA, michaelliao@nicoschc.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811390383?accountid=14925

Abstract: A total of 31 Chinese community members (8 males and 23 females) were recruited from three social service agencies in San Francisco (Donaldina Cameron House, Richmond Area Multi-Services, and St. Mary's Chinese Center) to participate in a study examining the relationship between problem gambling and intimate partner violence (IPV). A survey approach was taken which assessed the participants' demographic characteristics including age, gender, country of birth, and employment, as well as factors relating to their intimate partners, including partner's alcohol abuse and problem gambling. Younger participants and those whose partners were problem gamblers were more likely to experience IPV. However, partner's problem gambling was a significant predictor only at the ten-point cutoff on the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) (Lesieur and Blume, American Journal of Psychiatry, 1987) and not at the five-point cutoff. Chinese participants whose partners were problem gamblers (SOGS greater than or equal to 10) were 27.5 times more likely to experience IPV. Findings are discussed and social work practice, policy, and research implications are highlighted.

Direct and Indirect Services for Children in Domestic Violence Shelters

Abstract: The majority of women entering battered women's shelters bring children with them and those children often require specialized programs that address the ways in which witnessing domestic violence has affected them. Several programs have been developed and implemented; however, few have been empirically evaluated. The current article critically examines several intervention strategies and their effectiveness. Barriers to service are also identified. Although there is a paucity of research in this area, the present review suggests that intervening with children may show promise for breaking the cycle of violence. Adapted from the source document.

Types of Violence against Women and Factors Influencing Intimate Partner Violence in Togo (West Africa)

Author: Moore, Ami R11 Department of Sociology, University of North Texas, P. O. Box 311157, Denton, TX 76203, USA amoore@unt.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61429992?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence against women has been recognized as an important social and human rights issue that affects all cultures and societies. Although this issue has been more frequently studied in high-income countries, such as the United States, the scholarly research of violence against women in Africa, especially West Africa, has been scarce. Using a representative sample, this study examined violence against women in Togo, particularly the types of violence that Togolese women endure, and factors that affect a Togolese woman's chance of being victimized by her intimate partner. The findings indicated that Togolese women experienced different forms of violence. Also, some covariates at the individual level significantly affected a woman's risk of experiencing intimate partner violence. Several policy recommendations have been made. Adapted from the source document.

Attitudes of Jordanian Society Toward Wife Abuse

Author: Btoush, Rula1; Haj-Yahia, Muhammad M1 University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61777266?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors conducted an exploratory study among a convenience sample of 260 Jordanian men and women, using self-administered open and closed questions to examine the participants' approach toward wife abuse. In general, there was high awareness of wife abuse and the different types of abuse (mainly physical and psychological), a general tendency to oppose wife abuse, a tendency to blame the victim for abuse, and a lesser tendency to blame the abuse on the husband, marital problems, as well as familial and societal conditions. There was also a strong tendency to consider wife abuse a personal and familial issue rather than a social and legal problem. Therefore, the preferred method for coping with wife abuse and violence was the expectation that the abused wife should change her behavior and assume responsibility to change her husband followed by resorting to informal agents (family or community or religious figures). Less preferred coping methods included confronting the husband and expressing desire to break up or separate and resorting to formal agents (social welfare programs, counseling, legal system), as a last resort in cases of repeated abuse and severe physical violence. The implications of these findings for future research, interventions, and policy formulation are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

Intimate Partner Violence Among Male and Female Russian University Students

Author: Lysova, Aleksandra V1; Douglas, Emily M1 Far Eastern National University, Russia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61787296?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports data from three Russian sites of the International Dating Violence Study. Using a sample of 338 university students (54% female) from three Russian university sites, four different types of partner violence are examined: physical assault, physical injury, sexual coercion, and psychological aggression. High prevalence rates were found for all types of violence, aggression, and coercion. Consistent with previous research, male and female students were about equally likely to be victims and perpetrators of all violent and aggressive actions. Recommendations for prevention are made in the conclusions. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

Anger Disturbances Among Perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence. Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Court-Mandated Treatment

Author: Eckhardt, Christopher I1; Samper, Rita E; Murphy, Christopher M1 Purdue University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809309944?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the present study, the authors clustered a pretreatment sample of 190 perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV) mandated to attend group counseling based on State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory scores and examined whether these profiles were associated with differential outcomes 1 year postadjudication. Cluster analysis revealed 3 groups: (a) high anger-expressive (HA-E, n = 56), (b) moderate anger-inexpressive (MA-IE; n = 13), and (c) low anger (LA; n = 118). HA-E men perpetrated more IPV, reported experiencing and witnessing more abuse during childhood, scored higher on psychopathology measures, and reported more substance problems. HA-E and MA-IE males had higher program attrition and rearrest rates; MA-IE males were more likely to be arrested for assault-related offenses. Thus, although the majority of partner-abusive men do not present with anger-related disturbances, the presence of anger problems may be a marker for an array of traits that may complicate the treatment process.

Intersections of Harm and Health: A Qualitative Study of Intimate Partner Violence in Women's Lives

Author: Thomas, Kristie A1; Joshi, Manisha; Wittenberg, Eve; McCloskey, Laura A1 University of Pennsylvania

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61774802?accountid=14925

Abstract: Eight focus groups of women with recent exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) were conducted to elicit women's descriptions of how IPV affects their health. Their shared narratives reveal a complex relationship with three main points of intersection between IPV and health: IPV leading to adverse health effects; IPV worsening already compromised health; and women's illness or disability increasing dependency on abusive partners, thereby lengthening the duration of IPV exposure. Women describe bidirectional and cyclical ways through which IPV and health intersect over time. Service providers, including physicians, need to better understand the myriad ways that abuse affects women's health. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

The value of narrative in understanding Mongolian and Australian women's journeys of survival recovery and remaking of self, through and beyond domestic violence

Author: Oke, Marion11 Postal address: PO Box 392, Daylesford, 3460, Victoria, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61688108?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article I argue that a narrative method and analysis may work across cultures to aid in the understanding of women's experiences of survival, recovery and remaking of self following domestic violence. This article draws on a cross-cultural narrative analysis of eleven Mongolian and eleven Australian women's stories of survival, recovery and remaking of self following domestic/intimate partner violence. The very diversity of the Mongolian and Australian women offers a case for the value of narrative method. The focus of the article is the rationale for and explanation of feminist, qualitative, cross-cultural and narrative research methods which underpinned the study. Interspersed throughout the discussion are illustrative excerpts from the women's stories which support the argument that there are some deep similarities between the experiences of Mongolian and Australian women.

Social Change Movements and the Struggle over Meaning-Making: A Case Study of Domestic Violence Narratives

Author: Lehrner, Amy1; Allen, Nicole E1 Dept Psychology, U Illinois Urbana-Champaign lehrner@uiuc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61399426?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social movement theorists have emphasized the important role of meaning-making for social change movements (e.g., D. A. Snow & R. D. Benford, 1992, In: A. D. Morris & C. M. Mueller (Eds.) Frontiers in social movement theory. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT, pp 133-155; C. M. Mueller, 1992, In: A. D. Morris & C. M. Mueller (Eds.) Frontiers in social movement theory. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT, pp 3-26). Using the domestic violence movement as a case study, this study undertakes a close analysis of advocates' narratives about the phenomenon of domestic violence. This analysis sheds light on the current status of the movement as a social change movement attempting to promote alternative understandings of domestic violence as a social, rather than individual, problem. Study findings provide some evidence that the domestic violence movement has become increasingly de-politicized by documenting a range of narratives that convey an apolitical, degendered, individual-level analysis of domestic violence.

Beyond Power and Control: Clinical Interventions with Men Engaged in Partner Abuse

Author: Aymer, Samuel R11 Hunter School of Social Work, 129 East 79th Street, New York, NY 10021, USA saymer@hunter.cuny.edu

Abstract: Within the context of agency practice, most programs for abusive men are informed by the Duluth Model, suggesting that male violence against women is influenced by the dictates of patriarchy and sexism. Accordingly, this model promotes the importance of educational groups, which aim to debunk men's stereotypical beliefs about women. Thus, men's early abuse history, which also contributes to the use of violence, is omitted from service delivery. In contrast, this article explores the use of clinical interventions with men engaged in partner abuse with particular emphasis on a psychodynamic approach. The premise is that exposure to partner abuse during childhood as well as being the target of child abuse both shape the histories of these men in varying degrees, often manifesting in shame, depression, anxiety, and fear of abandonment, resulting in a poor self-image. Since environmental and socio-cultural influences inhibit them from expressing feelings associated with their experiences, clinical work, in contrast, encourages the development of insight and helps build skills that facilitate adaptive psychosocial functioning. This process unlocks suppression of affect by giving them ways to examine how certain events that occurred earlier in their lives contribute to the ways in which they treat their partners. Attachment, social learning and object relations theories all provide the theoretical frameworks. The case of Tom addresses partner abuse in the context of heterosexual relationships, demonstrating how psychodynamically informed psychotherapy can benefit abusive men.

Women and Male Partner-dating Violence in Nigeria: Articles

Author: Izugbara, Chimaraoke Otutubikey1; Duru, Emmanuel J C; Dania, Peter O1 African Population and Health Research Centre, Nairobi, Kenya and the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Uyo, PMB 1017, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria coizugbara@yahoo.com

Abstract: In this article we address experiences, understandings of and responses to dating violence among a small sample of abused Nigerian female university students. Dating violence broadly manifested in forms such as physical hurt, sexual harassment and emotional abuse in public and private spaces appears to be a male strategy for sustaining women's place within certain culturally defined boundaries. Women's views regarding their abuse reinforce the cultural belief that men are naturally violent and that women are sometimes to be blamed. Women's understandings of their abuse and responses to it refract the patriarchal ideologies that organise gender relations in Nigeria. Social and cultural institutions need to be repositioned to meet the challenges posed by the abuse of women by their intimate male partners.

Domestic Violence in India. Effects of Education

Author: Simister, John1; Makowiec, Judith1 Management Department, Birkbeck College, University of London, Malet Street, London, WC1E 7HX, UK

Abstract: This article studies domestic violence between husband and wife in India, and attitudes to domestic violence. We use the term 'gender-based violence' because some men use violence to control their wives. Data from the Demographic and Health Survey 1998-2000 has been analysed. This survey includes women in the ages of 15 to 49, in 26 Indian states. We focus only on violence by husbands against wives, ignoring other types of violence (such as a wife being hit by her husband's family, or a man being hit by his wife). Evidence in this paper is consistent with previous research indicating that gender-based violence is very prevalent in India. It seems likely that it is related to whether such violence is seen as acceptable in the perpetrator's family and in the local community. We suggest that there are similarities between the behaviour of some Indian men and the 'machismo' values reported in other cultures (especially in Latin America). We confirm previous claims that violence is less common if women and men are well educated; we also note that acceptance of domestic violence appears to be related to the respondent's education level. Thus, we encourage the Government of India to prioritise education for both boys and girls.

Intimate Partner Violence: Perceptions of Samoan Women

Author: Magnussen, Lois1; Shoultz, Jan; Hansen, Kay; Sapolu, Merina; Samifua, Mili1 Department of Nursing, University of Hawaii, Manoa, 2528 McCarthy Mall, Honolulu, HI 96744, USA

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine cultural perceptions, awareness, responses, and actions recommended about IPV by Samoan women served by a Community Health Center (CHC). Theoretical Foundation This investigation is a part of a series of exploratory community based participatory research (CBPR) studies based on critical social theory. Research Design and Methods This qualitative study was conducted using focus groups with Samoan women served by a health center. Analysis of qualitative data was accomplished using content analysis. Demographic data were analyzed using descriptive methods. Participants Eight Samoan women, 18 years and older participated in the focus groups. Procedure The instruments were translated from English to Samoan and back translated into English. The facilitators conducted an initial focus group and a validation group with the same participants. Sessions were taped and transcribed in Samoan and back translated into English. Results The women clearly identified IPV and were aware that it occurs in their cultural group. They identified multiple responses of individual women, families, and communities to IPV. In Samoa there was a formalized process for addressing this problem that has been changed in Hawai'i. The CHCs are viewed as an important resource for the families and can be a source of interventions. Implications Health care providers should be aware of differences between Western notions of independence and the ideals of interdependence held by specific cultural groups. The CHC personnel have raised questions about the appropriateness of using tools that were developed for use with Western women with immigrant women. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Abuse and PTSD Symptomatology: Examining Mediators and Moderators of the Abuse-Trauma Link

Abstract: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to intimate partner abuse, physiological reactivity, and social support. The authors used structural equation modeling to test social support as a moderator and psychophysiological reactivity and anger as mediators of the relation between abuse and traumatic symptoms among a sample of women reporting psychological abuse, including women reporting both physical violence and no physical violence. Both physical and psychological abuse were related to PTSD symptoms. Whereas physical and psychological abuse were highly correlated, psychological abuse did not predict PTSD symptomatology over and above the effect due to physical assault. Psychophysiological reactivity and anger and fear displayed during an argument with the partner did not mediate the abuse-trauma link. Social support moderated the relation between psychological abuse and PTSD symptomatology. [Copyright 2008 The American Psychological Association.]

Longitudinal Moderators of the Relationship Between Excessive Drinking and Intimate Partner Violence in the Early Years of Marriage

Author: Schumacher, Julie A1; Homish, Gregory G; Leonard, Kenneth E; Quigley, Brian M; Kearns-Bodkin, Jill N1 Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, University of Mississippi Medical Center, 2500 North State Street, Jackson, MS 39216 jschumacher@psychiatry.umsmed.edu

Abstract: Alcohol problems are one of the most well-established risk factors for physical intimate partner violence. Nonetheless, most individuals who drink heavily do so without ever aggressing against a partner. Laboratory research identifies hostility as an important moderator of the association between alcohol and general aggression, and correlational research suggests that stress and coping may also be important moderators of the alcohol-aggression link. Building on this research, the authors examined hostility, coping, and daily hassles as moderators of the associations between excessive drinking and intimate partner violence across the first 4 years of marriage in a sample of 634 newly married couples. Excessive drinking was a significant cross-sectional correlate, but it did not emerge as a unique longitudinal predictor of intimate partner violence perpetration in this sample. However, alcohol was longitudinally predictive of husband violence among hostile men with high levels of avoidance coping. Findings generally supported the moderation model, particularly for men. These findings implicate hostility, coping, and daily hassles, as well as alcohol, as potentially important targets for partner violence prevention strategies for young married couples.

The Relationship Between Violence in the Family of Origin and Dating Violence Among College Students

Author: Gover, Angela R1; Kaukinen, Catherine; Fox, Kathleen A1 University of Colorado Denver

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809329745?accountid=14925

Abstract: Prior research has established that violence in dating relationships is a serious social problem among adolescents and young adults. Exposure to violence during childhood has been linked to dating violence victimization and perpetration. Also known as the intergenerational transmission of violence, the link between violence during childhood and dating violence has traditionally focused on physical violence. This research examines the relationship between experiencing and perpetrating dating violence and exposure to violence in the family of origin. Specifically, the current research examines gender differences in the relationship between exposure to violence during childhood and physical and psychological abuse perpetration and victimization. Data were collected from a sample of approximately 2,500 college students at two southeastern universities. Findings indicate that childhood exposure to violence is a consistent predictor of involvement in relationships characterized by violence for males and females. The implications of the current research on policy are discussed.

Sexual Relationship Power, Intimate Partner Violence, and Condom Use Among Minority Urban Girls

Author: Teitelman, Anne M1; Ratcliffe, Sarah J; Morales-Aleman, Mercedes M; Sullivan, Cris M1 University of Pennsylvania

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61682928?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the association between sexual relationship power, intimate partner violence, and condom use among African American and Hispanic urban girls. In this sample of 56 sexually active girls, 50% did not use condoms consistently and therefore were at higher risk for acquiring HIV or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Teens who experienced more intimate partner violence had a significantly higher likelihood of inconsistent condom use and therefore a greater risk for HIV/STDs. Girls' sense of sexual control in their relationships was not directly associated with inconsistent condom use but was inversely related to verbal and emotional abuse. Interventions aimed at reducing HIV/STD risk for adolescent girls need to address patterns of dominance and control in adolescent relationships as well as multiple forms of partner violence. This suggests the need for multilevel intervention approaches that promote girls' agency and multiple ways to keep girls safe from perpetrators of partner abuse.

Factors Related to Willingness to Help Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Beeble, Marisa L1; Post, Lori A; Bybee, Deborah; Sullivan, Cris M1 Michigan State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61437923?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although researchers have found that survivors of intimate partner violence seek support from a multitude of sources, ranging from professionals to informal support networks, little is known about the extent to which community members reach out to help survivors. This study explored the type of support provided to survivors and various factors that relate to individuals' willingness to help. Survivors were more likely to be helped by women, younger individuals, those who strongly endorsed criminal justice interventions for perpetrators, and those who perceived intimate partner violence as a frequently occurring issue in their communities. Two additional factors were found to relate to an individual's likelihood of assisting others, including witnessing intimate partner violence as a child and prior victimization. Further research is needed in this area to explore helper, survivor, and contextual characteristics that may affect one's likelihood to offer assistance to survivors.

Methods for Estimating Medical Expenditures Attributable to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Brown, Derek S1; Finkelstein, Eric A; Mercy, James A1 RTI International

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809330227?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article compares three methods for estimating the medical cost burden of intimate partner violence against U.S. adult women (18 years and older), 1 year postvictimization. To compute the estimates, prevalence data from the National Violence Against Women Survey are combined with cost data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the Medicare 5% sample, and published studies and with relative risk estimates from published studies. Results are compared and reasons for difference are explored, including the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Estimates of the medical cost burden of intimate partner violence within the first 12 months after victimization range from $2.3 billion to $7.0 billion, depending on the method used. Although limited to women victimized in the last year, each method reveals that intimate partner violence imposes a substantial burden on the health care system. Among the approaches, there is no clear gold standard nor any evidence of bias.

The Longitudinal Association of Adolescent Dating Violence With Psychiatric Disorders and Functioning

Author: Brown, Adrienne1; Cosgrave, Elizabeth; Killackey, Eoin; Purcell, Rosemary; Buckby, Joe; Yung, Alison R1 ORYGEN Research Centre, University of Melbourne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61362618?accountid=14925

Abstract: While the prevalence, correlates and mental health impacts of intimate partner violence are well documented in adolescents and young adults, fewer studies have considered physical dating violence among clinical samples of help-seeking young people. In a sample of 98 young people aged 15-24 years (54% females) referred to a specialist public youth mental health service, we examined the 12-month prevalence of physical violence inflicted by an intimate partner and its relationship with psychiatric disorders and psychosocial functioning. The reported prevalence of dating violence in the 12 months prior to referral was 13%. Physical dating violence reported at referral was associated with poorer psychosocial functioning, substance dependence and comorbid Axis I diagnoses at 6-month follow-up. These findings suggest that youth mental health services are well positioned not only to screen for dating violence but to intervene to ameliorate the mental health consequences of abuse and to prevent further violence.

Is policing domestic violence institutionally racist? A case study of south Asian Women

Author: Belur, Jyoti11 Department of Sociology, London School of Economics, London, UK j.s.belur@lse.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61441953?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the relationship between police services offered to Asian women as victims of domestic violence and institutional racism. Interviews with officers and women belonging to the minority ethnic communities in two police force areas in England showed that black and minority ethnic (BME) women victims of domestic violence suffer a double disadvantage in terms of the poor service that victims of domestic violence receive in general and because their special needs on account of their ethnicity are not taken into account. The article identifies various problem areas in the way domestic violence incidents in the Asian community are policed, and argues that discussing this issue as an outcome of institutionally racist practices would give it a higher profile and perhaps provide a stronger impetus for introducing necessary reforms and changes in police policy, practice, and training. Adapted from the source document.

Children and Domestic Violence: Constructing a Policy Problem in Australia and New Zealand

Author: Powell, Anastasia1; Murray, Suellen1 RMIT University, Melbourne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61695887?accountid=14925

Abstract: The intersection of public policy and legislation addressing children and domestic violence is fraught with complexity. Domestic violence responses, child protection responses and family law responses, all potentially collide where a child witnesses or experiences domestic violence. These responses not only operate with different purposes and assumptions, but also construct the problem of domestic violence in different ways. This article is based on the preliminary findings of a larger research project exploring the history of domestic violence policy in Australia. Drawing on Bacchi's (1999) 'what's the problem represented to be?' approach we consider how children's experiences of domestic violence are named and framed in Australian and New Zealand law and policy. In identifying and making apparent these particular understandings, and considering the implications of these meanings for current responses, we seek to open up debates on the future direction of domestic violence policy and legislation concerned with children.

Domestic Violence and the Exemption from Seeking Child Support: Providing Safety or Legitimizing Ongoing Poverty and Fear

Author: Patrick, Rebecca1; Cook, Kay; McKenzie, Hayley1 School of Health and Social Development, Deakin University, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, VIC Australia, 3125

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/813118463?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the experience of low-income women on welfare in Australia and the process of seeking child support from a violent ex-partner, contrasting this with research from the United States and the United Kingdom. Women in Australia who fear ongoing or renewed abuse as a result of seeking child support are eligible for an exemption. However, the exemption policy does not necessarily provide the intended protection of women and children from ongoing abuse and poverty. The exemption policy route also produces an unintended outcome whereby the perpetrators of violence are financially rewarded as they do not have to pay child support. These outcomes are shaped by a complex interaction of personal, cultural and structural forces that make the process of seeking child support for women who have experienced violence extremely problematic. The article demonstrates how in Australia, as in the US and UK policy contexts, the needs of women and their children are compromised by the details of policy specification and the way policies are implemented within the different systems.

Intimate Partner Violence and Women's Contraceptive Use

Author: Williams, Corrine M1; Larsen, Ulla; McCloskey, Laura A1 University of Kentucky

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61709910?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence has been hypothesized as a factor associated with women's risk for problems in contraception use or access. This article explores differences in contraceptive use between abused and nonabused women, using a case-control study of 225 women. Women experiencing physical and emotional abuse were more likely to report not using their preferred method of contraception in the past 12 months compared with nonabused women (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.0 to 3.7). Health care providers need to consider how intimate partner violence may influence their patients' use of contraceptives, which has implications for the high risk of unintended pregnancies among abused women.

'Violence Is an International Language': Tamil Women's Perceptions of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Mason, Robin1; Hyman, Ilene; Berman, Helene; Guruge, Sepali; Kanagaratnam, Pushpa; Manuel, Lisa1 University of Toronto

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61705999?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on intimate partner violence (IPV) across populations is challenging because of the multiplicity of definitions and lack of clarity about the behaviors that constitute IPV. The purpose of this study was to examine the ways in which Sri Lankan Tamil women in Toronto understand, define, and experience IPV. Focus group interviews were conducted with women representing different ages and stages of life. Findings suggest that definitions of IPV were not culturally specific. Rather, the Tamil women defined IPV broadly and recognized different forms of coercive control. However, psychologically abusive behaviors were identified that held particular meanings for this community. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

Factors Associated With Engagement in a Police-Advocacy Home-Visit Intervention to Prevent Domestic Violence

Author: Stover, Carla Smith1; Rainey, Anna M; Berkman, Miriam; Marans, Steven1 Yale University Child Study Center

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61430080?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines factors related to engagement in the services offered by police officer-advocate teams on the basis of police and clinical records for 301 female victims referred to the Domestic Violence Home Visit Intervention (DVHVI) program. The authors find that the severity of intimate partner violence charges and ethnicity of the victim, advocate, and police officer are all significantly related to engagement in the DVHVI, with Hispanic women served by Hispanic advocate-officer teams more engaged in services than African American or Caucasian women. The data suggest that this intervention model may be particularly beneficial for Hispanic victims of intimate partner violence when implemented by a Spanish-speaking officer-advocate team.

Empowerment and Programs Designed to Address Domestic Violence

Author: Kasturirangan, Aarati11 University of Illinois at Chicago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61743790?accountid=14925

Abstract: Programs designed to address domestic violence often name empowerment of women as a major program goal. However, programs do not necessarily define what empowerment for survivors of domestic violence entails. This review examines the literature on empowerment, including characteristics of an empowerment process and critiques of empowerment. Diversity of goals for empowerment and differences in access to resources for women experiencing domestic violence are explored as two major factors that should inform program development. Recommendations are offered for developing programs to address domestic violence that support women engaged in an empowerment process.

Prohibiting domestic violence through legislation in Nigeria

Author: Ojigho, Osai J11 African Court Project with Alliances for Africa, Legal Research and Developments Consultants, and International Criminal Court, The Hague, The Netherlands

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417524166?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Prohibition Against Domestic Violence Law of Lagos, State Law No 15, 2007, was enacted as a response to the rising incidents of violence against women in Lagos State. The state of the legal system prior to the enactment of the Law was generally unfavourable to women who suffered beatings and abuse from their partners. The Criminal and Penal Codes provide for punishment for assault but most women would not consider taking their partners before the Law Courts. The enforcement agencies, such as the police, were not interested in pursuing cases of a 'domestic' nature when there were more 'serious' crimes such as robbery to deal with. The law prohibiting domestic violence is a mechanism to correct the inadequacies of the legal system by ensuring that victims of domestic violence are protected, the strict compliance of police officers in apprehending suspects, providing alternative orders such as interim protection orders and expanding the definition of the laws that constitute domestic violence. This Focus analyses the law in order to identify ways that women can access justice through the judicial system and proffers suggestions for the effective elimination of violence against women in Nigeria. Adapted from the source document.

The contribution of childhood emotional abuse to teen dating violence among child protective services-involved youth

Author: Wekerle, Christine1; Leung, Eman; Wall, Anne-Marie; MacMillan, Harriet; Boyle, Michael; Trocme, Nico; Waechter, Randall1 Faculty of Education, Department of Psychology, Psychiatry Program, University of Western Ontario, London, Ont., Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61689081?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: For child protective services (CPS) youth who may have experienced more than one form of maltreatment, the unique contribution of emotional abuse may be over-looked when other forms are more salient and more clearly outside of accepted social norms for parenting. This study considers the unique predictive value of childhood emotional abuse for understanding adolescent post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology and dating violence. Further, PTSD symptomatology is assessed as an explanatory bridge in the emotional abuse-teen dating violence link. Methods: A random sample of 402 youth from the active caseload of a large urban CPS catchment area participated as part of a larger longitudinal study on adolescent health behaviors. Mid-adolescent youth across types of CPS status were targeted. CPS youth reported on lifetime maltreatment experiences, PTSD symptomatology, and past year dating experiences, using published scales. Results: Over 85% of CPS youth had begun dating. For dating youth, some level of dating violence was common: over half of females (63-67%) and nearly half of males (44-49%). Taking into account other forms of maltreatment, emotional abuse emerged as a significant predictor of both PTSD symptomatology and dating violence among males and females. PTSD symptomatology was a significant mediator of the male emotional abuse-perpetration and the female emotional/physical abuse-victimization links, indicating a gendered patterning to findings. Conclusions: These results indicate that: (1) CPS youth are a high priority group for dating violence and PTSD-linked intervention; and (2) CPS youth continue to experience the unique negative impact of childhood emotional abuse in their adolescent adjustment. All CPS children should be evaluated for emotional abuse incurred, and appropriate intervention attention be given as to how it specifically impacts on the child's approach to relating to themselves and to others. Practice implications: The present study directs practice implications in regards to: (1) the problem of teen dating violence, (2) the salience of childhood emotional abuse; and (3) the importance of targeting PTSD symptomatolgy among CPS youth. A substantial number of CPS youth report early engagement in violent romantic relationships and require support towards attaining the non-coercive relationship experiences of their non-CPS-involved age mates. The topic of dating, healthy dating relationships, and dating violence may need to be part of the regular casework, with a view towards supporting youths' conceptualization of and skill set for healthy, close relationships. Further, this knowledge needs to be translated to foster parents and group home staff. With regard to the impact of childhood emotional abuse, CPS workers need to be sensitive to its potential for long-term, unique impact impairing relationship development. Emotional abuse is (a) unique among genders (i.e., for females, it clusters with physical abuse) and (b) uniquely predictive of PTSD symptoms and dating violence. Finally, as is consistent with theory and biopsychosocial evidence, PTSD symptomatology is a key causal candidate for understanding maltreatment-related impairment. Attention to targeting PTSD symptoms may be preventative for dating violence; attention to targeting emotional abuse experiences may be preventative for PTSD symptoms. CPS youth are an important population to involve in research, as their inclusion adds to the evidence-base to achieve evidence-informed practice and policy within child welfare.

Child Welfare Professionals' Experiences of Childhood Exposure to Domestic Violence

Author: van den Bosse, Sandra; McGinn, Melanie A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758128401?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explores the impact of childhood exposure to domestic violence and using family intervention techniques. In interviews, 12 child welfare professionals explored their experiences with the violence, the family interventions, the lifelong impact, and its influence on their career choice. The results pointed to a need for creating more opportunities for children to talk about their lives with professionals, for improved screening techniques, and for a preference for interventions focusing on rehabilitation for the batterer, which maintained family preservation.

Hypermasculinity, Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual Aggression, Social Support, and Child Maltreatment Risk in Urban, Heterosexual Fathers Taking Parenting Classes

Author: Vasquez Guerrero, Desi Alonzo11 UNC School Of Low, Van Hecke-Wettach Hall, 160 Ridge Road, CB #3380, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3380 Vasquez@unc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741610531?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the relationships between hyper-masculinity, sexual aggression, intimate partner violence, social support, and child maltreatment risk among heterosexual fathers completing parenting classes. Hypermasculinity scores were found to be significant predictors of study participants' reported verbal, physical, and sexual aggression toward their intimate partners. Only lack of social support, operationalized as the reported frequency of participants' conversations with friends, relatives, or neighbors about their problems, was found to be a significant predictor of child maltreatment risk. Alcohol frequency, education, and monthly income were not found to be unique, significant predictors of any dependent variables. Implications for clinical practice and research as well as limitations to the current study are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic violence and women with disabilities: locating the issue on the periphery of social movements

Author: Nixon, Jennifer11 Ruskin College, Oxford, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61767181?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women with disabilities, like non-disabled women, are at risk of experiencing abuse perpetrated by those closest to them. This paper reviews what is known about the domestic abuse of disabled women, explores some of the dynamics of that abuse and considers why this issue has not been high on the agenda of either the movement against domestic violence or the disabled people's movement in the UK, taking into consideration several points that disabled women have raised. In doing so it focuses on the concept of compound oppressions as a potential explanation for the failure of this problem to have widespread recognition as a social issue. Adapted from the source document.

Victim Narratives, Legal Representation, and Domestic Violence Civil Protection Orders

Author: Durfee, Alesha11 Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/880441297?accountid=14925

Abstract: The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between the use of legal representation and domestic violence civil protection order hearing outcomes. In most jurisdictions, the protection order process has been bureaucratized and carefully structured to facilitate access for victims without legal representation; however, results of an analysis of protection order cases indicates that even with 'victim-friendly' procedures and forms, individuals without legal representation are significantly less likely to have their requests for protection orders granted. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of institutional inequalities in the American legal system.

Intersections of Immigration and Domestic Violence. Voices of Battered Immigrant Women

Author: Erez, Edna1; Adelman, Madelaine; Gregory, Carol1 University of Illinois at Chicago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/813019005?accountid=14925

Abstract: Feminist criminologists have helped to criminalize domestic violence in the United States and elsewhere. With this significant accomplishment, scholars also have critiqued the intended and unintended consequences of such reliance on the state for women's safety. One such critique reveals the intersectionality of social inequalities, social identities, and domestic violence. Here, the authors analyze the relationship between immigration and domestic violence based on interviews with 137 immigrant women in the United States from 35 countries. They find that immigration shapes how women understand domestic violence, their access to resources, and responses to domestic violence. This project documents observed dynamics of structural intersectionality for immigrant women as national origin and citizenship status are considered as another layer of identity politics and marginalization in relation to domestic violence.

Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration Among College Students. The Role of Gender Role and Gendered Violence Attitudes

Author: Nabors, Erin L1; Jasinski, Jana L1 University of Central Florida, Orlando

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/813018731?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the relationships between college students' attitudes regarding gender roles and gendered violence and their perpetration of intimate partner violence. Although findings from previous studies demonstrate associations between gender role and gendered violence-related attitudes and intimate partner violence, research to date fails to fully explore these associations. In an attempt to fill this void, the current study looks at attitudes before and after perpetration is reported to determine whether attitudes precede or follow perpetration. Additionally, the study examines these relationships among a previously unexplored set of attitudes within the physical violence literature-those related to chivalry. Findings suggest that the relationships between attitudes and intimate partner violence are more complex than prior research indicates and differ for female and male college students.

Enculturation as a Condition Impacting Korean American Physicians' Responses to Korean Immigrant Women Suffering Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Chung, Grace H1; Oswald, Ramona F; Hardesty, Jennifer L1 1 Normal Ave., Montclair, NJ 07043, USA chungg@mail.montclair.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61725088?accountid=14925

Abstract: We explored how Korean American (KA) physicians in the Los Angeles area respond in their medical practice to Korean immigrant women with a history of intimate partner violence (IPV). Twenty physicians were recruited and interviewed in-depth. Grounded theory analyses revealed that KA physicians' responses to IPV ranged from denying signs of IPV and trivializing IPV to acknowledging IPV. Physician response was related to the degree to which he or she was enculturated in mainstream medical practice norms in the United States. We advance current knowledge on physicians' IPV screening and intervention practices by exploring the practices of KA physicians, in particular. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence: Prevalence and Perceptions of Married Men in Ibadan, Nigeria

Author: Fawole, Olufunmilayo L1; Salawu, Tokunbo A; Olarinmoye, Esther O Asekun1 University of Ibadan, Nigeria

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862780634?accountid=14925

Abstract: In sub-Saharan Africa rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) are high. Thus, identifying reasons for abuse is crucial in ensuring women's health. Hence, men's perception of IPV was assessed, and prevalence of abuse determined. Survey of 820 married men from six urban communities in Ibadan was done using interviewer administered questionnaire. Four focus group discussions were conducted. Lifetime prevalence of perpetration of physical abuse was 25.1%, while psychological violence was 44.4%. Two hundred and forty (29.3%) had ever perpetrated sexual violence and 23.2% economic violence. At least one of these forms of violence had been perpetrated by 44.1% of the respondents. 'Being rude' (66.4%) and 'insufficient care of the children' (54.3%) were common justifications for IPV. Motive of the abuse were 'to make partner responsible' (60.3%) and 'to obtain respect' (59.9%). Predictors of perpetrating violence were being in polygamous unions (OR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.11-3.03), consuming alcohol (AOR 1.67; 95% CI: 1.10-2.53), and being Moslem (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.21-2.910). Men with inadequate knowledge and negative attitudes had greater likelihood of perpetrating IPV (AOR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.37-3.26 and AOR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.33-3.27). IPV was also associated with young age. Premarital counseling on how to resolve conflict without resulting to violence and early education of boys on violence to women is recommended. Adapted from the source document.

Prosecuting Domestic Violence: New Solutions To Old Problems?

Author: Hall, Matthew11 Centre for Criminological Research, University of Sheffield, Bartolome House, Winter Street, Sheffield, S3 7ND, UK m.p.hall@sheffield.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61795086?accountid=14925

Abstract: Drawing on empirical data gathered at two courts in the north of England, this paper examines the administration of courts and the occupational cultures of practitioners and court staff running domestic violence trials in the magistrates' courts. The paper evaluates the practical outcomes of recent moves by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to improve conviction rates for these cases and the impact this has had on victims of domestic violence who are reluctant to give evidence. The resultant discussion examines the role of domestic violence victims in the decision to prosecute. It is argued that no radical alteration of the present system of trials in England and Wales is required to fulfil the expectations of these victims, but rather occupational cultures must be adapted to civilise that system, treating domestic violence victims as contributors to and participants in the process rather than as representatives of a particularly difficult and problematic source of work. Adapted from the source document.

The Nature and Correlates of Dating Violence among Jewish and Arab Youths in Israel

Author: Sherer, Moshe11 Bob Shapell School of Social Work, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel Sherer1@post.tau.ac.il

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61441641?accountid=14925

Abstract: The objectives of this research were to assess the prevalence and severity of dating violence among Jewish and Arab, male and female Israeli youths, to examine the sociodemographic variables related to dating violence among Israeli adolescents, and to assess whether the variables correlated with dating violence differ among Jewish and Arab, male and female youths. The random sample consisted of 1357 students (640 Jewish and 717 Arab youths). We used five types of dating violence measures: threatening, relational, physical, sexual, and verbal abuse. The principal finding is that dating violence is very high among Israeli youths, especially among Arabs. Males show higher mean scores of dating violence, but females are involved in every type of dating violence. The discussion attempts to explain the differences between the two cultures and genders, and considers the theoretical and practical implications of the results. Adapted from the source document.

Animal Abuse, Family Violence, and Child Wellbeing: A Review

Author: McPhedran, Samara11 School of Psychology A19, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, 2006, Australia smcphedran@iprimus.com.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61418167?accountid=14925

Abstract: Animal abuse and family violence appear to be 'linked' and tend to co-occur in the same households. Companion animals are often regarded as family members, if not by the abuser, then by others within the family. Consequently, in families where any given form of violence exists, animal abuse is also more likely to exist. This paper examines animal abuse in the context of abusive home environments, and the relationship between an abusive home in childhood and the range of behavioral problems that may extend into adulthood. Existing investigations are reviewed with reference to prevalence, epidemiology, and child development theory. It appears that holistic interventions to counter abusive home environments may represent the most effective way to break the association between animal cruelty and interpersonal violence, by addressing the shared situational characteristics common to a range of violent behaviors. Adapted from the source document.

The project used a 'train the trainer' model and provided computer and Internet resources to domestic violence service providers in order to (1) increase safe computer and Internet access for domestic violence survivors in Washington; (2) reduce the risk posed by abusers by educating survivors about technology safety and privacy; and (3) increase the ability of survivors to help themselves and their children through information technology. Evaluation of the project suggests that the program is needed, useful, and effective. Consumer satisfaction was high and there was perceived improvement in computer confidence and knowledge of computer safety. Areas for future program development and further research are discussed.

Ethnicity and Risk for Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Following Intimate Partner Violence: Prevalence and Predictors in European American and African American Women

Author: Lilly, Michelle M1; Graham-Bermann, Sandra A1 University of Michigan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61437437?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study uses a feminist theoretical framework to explore risk factors for the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms following intimate partner violence, with a community sample of 120 low-income European American and African American women. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine demographic, violence, and mental health variables that predict posttraumatic stress symptoms. The data reveal that African American women report lower levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms than do their European American peers. This difference was observed despite the presence of more empirically identified risk factors for African American women. Regression analyses show that symptoms of depression increase risk for posttraumatic stress for both groups. However, a difference was observed such that past victimization increase risk for only European American women, whereas amount of psychological violence in the previous year increases risk for only African American women. Potential explanations for observed ethnic differences are offered. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2009.]

Correlates of In-Law Conflict and Intimate Partner Violence Against Chinese Pregnant Women in Hong Kong

Author: Chan, Ko Ling1; Tiwari, Agnes; Fong, Daniel YT; Leung, Wing Cheong; Brownridge, Douglas A; Ho, Pak Chung1 University of Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/812979431?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines correlates of in-law conflict with intimate partner violence (IPV) against pregnant women in a cohort of Chinese pregnant women who visited antenatal clinics in Hong Kong. This was a territory-wide, cross-sectional study of 3,245 pregnant women recruited from seven hospitals in Hong Kong. Participants were invited to complete the Chinese Abuse Assessment Screen and a demographic questionnaire. About 9% of the pregnant women reported having been abused by their partners in the preceding year. In-law conflict was the characteristic most significantly associated with preceding-year abuse against pregnant women, after controlling for covariates. Findings underscore the need to obtain information on in-law conflict as a risk factor for IPV. In-law conflict should be included in the assessment of risk for IPV. For the prevention of IPV, family-based intervention is needed to work with victims as well as in-laws.

Attitudes of Domestic Violence Shelter Workers Toward Mandated Reporter Laws: A Study of Policy Support and Policy Impact

Author: Steen, Julie A11 University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61427602?accountid=14925

Abstract: In order to examine attitudes in the field of domestic violence toward mandated reporter laws, a survey was administered to domestic violence shelter workers. The respondents overwhelmingly supported the mandate to report abuse of a child. However, a mandate to report child witnessing of domestic violence was opposed by a slight majority. When compared with the group opposing the mandate, the group in support perceived more frequent occurrence of a report's positive impact and less frequent occurrence of a report's negative impacts. These results have implications for advocacy efforts that are focused on mandated reporter laws. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368526?accountid=14925

Abstract: Students studying addictive diseases must come to understand, among other issues, the interplay between intimate partner violence (IPV) and substance abuse. Statistics are important, but case examples elucidate for the students what to 'listen' for in their meetings with clients. The purpose of this article is to provide several case examples of addiction and IPV and the connection between the two, and to promote classroom discussion as to how to intervene when both issues are present in a client's life. Adapted from the source document.

Chinese Women Protesting Domestic Violence: The Beijing Conference, International Donor Agencies, and the Making of a Chinese Women's NGO

Author: Zhang, Lu11 Institute for Global Governance Studies, Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, China

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59993511?accountid=14925

Abstract: The "Domestic Violence in China: Research, Intervention and Prevention" Project of China Law Society, the first women's NGO in China organized exclusively against the issue of domestic violence, was launched in Beijing in 2000. This article examines the construction of this non-profit project as an outcome of dynamic interactions among a constellation of both global and local feminist forces and agents. It shows that the formation of the project combines three interwoven processes, which include 1) the emergence of women's NGOs and the rise of anti-domestic violence activism among the NGOs as a result of the Beijing Conference; 2) international donors' active economic cultivation of anti-gender violence activism among local women's NGOs; 3) participant activists' rationalization of the project as a worthwhile cause for their political commitment with their "vocabularies of motives." This article provides a contextualized study of the global spread of the feminist anti-violence against women cause from a local perspective, suggesting that the "global" and the "local," in the field of transnational feminism, should be treated more attentively as an interactive nexus rather than as largely independent entities. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The first part of this article describes the process of starting a counseling group for female university students who have experienced dating violence in their relationships and the resulting model that emerged from the process of developing the group. The objectives were to: (1) reflect and conceptualize the phenomenon of dating violence, (2) make suggestions for the creation of a group intervention model, (3) initiate a group intervention focused on empowerment and coping skills and (4) assume responsibility in the integral formation related to gender equality, justice and respect for human rights. Lastly, data on the impact and efficacy of the group counseling model collected through a qualitative study are presented. This study consisted of semi-structured interviews conducted with four of the participants and the results demonstrate that the group helped with both personal and relationship issues in the participants. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This special issue of Social Work & Christianity comes as a response to the increased demand for an open dialogue on intimate partner violence among social workers and social work educators, clergy and faith communities, and secular agencies providing services for women experiencing IPV. The issue is organized into two sections. The first presents a number of recent studies that explore dynamics of IPV in faith communities, the clergy's response to IPV, and spiritual beliefs as barriers or as components of the healing process. The second section presents two practice models of working with women, clergy, and faith communities to address IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Christianity and the Experience of Domestic Violence: What Does Faith Have to Do with It?

Abstract: Many religious men, women, teens and children look to their faith community for guidance and practical assistance in the aftermath of domestic violence. Looking at the interface between religion and abuse from a variety of perspectives, this article explores several unique features of the journey towards justice, safety, healing and wholeness for a religious victim, or perpetrator, of domestic violence. Whether someone is helped first by their congregation or a community-based agency, those who respond need to understand both the issue of domestic violence and the nature of religious faith. Building bridges between the steeple and the shelter-or congregations and their communities-is central to responding compassionately, and with best practices, to domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

"Because of my beliefs that I had acquired from the church...": Religious Belief-based Barriers for Adventist Women in Domestic Violence Relationships

Author: Popescu, Marciana1; Drumm, Rene; Mayer, Sylvia; Cooper, Laurie; Foster, Tricia; Seifert, Marge; Gadd, Holly; Dewan, Smita1 Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service, 400 Westchester Avenue, Room 128, West Harrison, NY 10604. Tel: 914-367-3437 popescu@fordham.edu

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects women in all socio-economic and religious strata. The belief systems women rely on affect their ability to acknowledge and challenge the abuse in their relationships and move towards safety. This study explores religious belief-based barriers that deter women survivors of IPV in a conservative Christian community from changing their circumstances. The religious belief-based barriers identified by women in this study consist of an internal layer of religious beliefs and external social reinforcers strengthening these beliefs. Using the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1984), we explore these belief barriers as they affect women primarily during the precontemplation and contemplation stages. The study contributes to the current literature in two ways: by presenting a set of beliefs that affect women in conservative faith communities, thus informing the practice of both social workers and clergy; and by introducing a new conceptual approach to change for women survivors of IPV in conservative faith communities. Adapted from the source document.

A Refuge for My Soul: Examining African American Clergy's Perceptions Related to Domestic Violence Awareness and Engagement in Faith Community Initiatives

Author: Brade, Kesslyn A1; Bent-Goodley, Tricia1 Bowie State University, 14000 Jericho Park Road, Bowie, MD, 20715. Tel: (301) 860-3252 Kbrade@bowiestate.edu

Abstract: There is historic evidence that African American religious leaders have advocated for the underserved and underprivileged by heightening awareness and engaging in initiatives focused on alleviating social ills. However, there is limited information regarding their perceptions surrounding heightening awareness and engaging in initiatives, particularly those related to domestic violence. This article seeks to fill this gap in the literature by describing the perceptions of a cohort of African American clergy seminarians related to domestic violence awareness and engagement in domestic violence initiatives within faith communities. Findings reveal (1) a perception of the presence of domestic violence in faith communities, (2) the need for additional training and preparation regarding domestic violence, and (3) the need for more domestic violence resource availability within and outside the church. Recommendations are made to social workers and clergy regarding their roles in heightening awareness and engaging in initiatives regarding the issue of domestic abuse in faith communities, particularly in faith communities of color. Adapted from the source document.

Addressing Domestic Violence: Challenges Experienced by Anglican Clergy in the Diocese of Cape Town, South Africa

Abstract: South African women live in one of the most violent, yet most religious societies in the world. In some countries like the USA, domestic violence training programs and various resources are available to equip clergy and their faith communities. This is not yet the case in South Africa. This qualitative study is one step towards creating a more comprehensive (inclusive of the religious sector), response to domestic violence. The study aimed at exploring challenges experienced by selected clergy within the Anglican Church of the Diocese of Cape Town when dealing with domestic violence. The sample was drawn based on experience of the clergy with the phenomenon and willingness to participate. Due to the sensitive nature of the study, probing questions were followed up to get in-depth perceptions and experiences of clergy's involvement in domestic violence within their parishes. The findings confirmed the complex nature of domestic violence. Clergy defined domestic violence as an oppressive controlling behaviour. The challenges reported primarily related to the lack of training in dealing with real life issues such as domestic violence during their theological training; the lack of theological guidelines offered by the church to address patriarchal societal practices, beliefs and gender stereotyping; and the lack of guidance on contextual interpretation of Scriptures. This paper addresses components of the study that confirm the enormous opportunity for the Church to refine and re-align itself to the "Gospel Commission" and respond intentionally to humanity regarding domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Christian social workers and religious communities are important components of a coordinated community response to domestic violence, since so many people of faith look to those with a faith perspective when seeking help. This article describes a clearinghouse website designed to facilitate such a coordinated response. The RAVE (Religion and Violence e-Learning) Project seeks to equip people of faith to respond to domestic violence in ways that are compassionate, practical and informed by the latest research and best practices by professionals; to build bridges between religious and secular services; to walk alongside victims and survivors; to work with youth in developing the skills for healthy relationships; and to hold abusers accountable. Adapted from the source document.

Responding to the Individual Trauma of Domestic Violence: Challenges for Mental Health Professionals

Author: Humphreys, Catherine11 University of Warwick, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1373429962?accountid=14925

Abstract: A clear link exists between domestic violence and mental health problems for women. Depression, trauma symptoms, and suicide attempts are issues that seriously undermine the emotional well-being of women who have been subjected to violence and abuse from their partner or ex-partner. This paper draws on a research project that highlighted the mental health issues for women using domestic violence services and raised a number of pertinent problems for policy and practice in this area. Bringing services for survivors into the mainstream of service provision within the health and mental health arena may bring problems if a model of individualized service provision is not enhanced by the involvement of professionals and their organizations in the social movement to support survivors and skills that enhance social support. Ideas put forward by Judith Herman (1992) are used to explore this argument. Adapted from the source document.

Review of the Association Between Treatment for Substance Misuse and Reductions in Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Stuart, Gregory L1; O'Farrell, Timothy J; Temple, Jeff R1 University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741613096?accountid=14925

Abstract: A substantial body of research supports a strong cross-sectional and longitudinal association between substance misuse and perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV). This article briefly addresses the theoretical connection between substance use and intimate partner violence and research on the association between substance misuse and IPV. Studies examining the effect of individual and couples-based addiction treatments on IPV are reviewed. The implications of this work and future directions for research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Prevention of Intimate Partner Violence in Substance-Using Populations

Author: Temple, Jeff R1; Stuart, Gregory L; O'Farrell, Timothy J1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741611287?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although the prevention of intimate partner violence is a major public health priority for the United States, little is known about how to prevent this form of violence. The strong cross-sectional and longitudinal association between substance misuse and partner violence suggests that substance-misusing populations may be an ideal audience for implementing partner violence prevention programs. This approach is reviewed from the perspective of universal, selective, and indicated prevention programs. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence: Local Activities -- International Issue

Author: Bruckner, Margrit

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59995256?accountid=14925

Abstract: Since violence against women in the family has been made public by the international women's movement beginning in the 1970ies in Western States and after 1989 also in Eastern Europe a rapidly growing number of institutions and networks emerged. There exists a growing number of networks on the level of the European Union, which supports the anti violence work and research on this topic. Adapted from the source document.

Backlash or Equality?: The Influence of Men's and Women's Rights Discourses on Domestic Violence Legislation in Ontario

Author: Girard, April L11 Queen's University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61387688?accountid=14925

Abstract: Through an examination of the public debates from Ontario's Bill 117, An Act to Better Protect Victims of Domestic Violence, this article explores the discourses that men's rights activists used to counter feminist constructions of domestic violence. Using a combined method, the author collapses the data into four important themes: protection, rights, and gender; funding and fairness; numerical and statistical truths; and resistance. By examining how they collectively construct the problem of domestic violence, the author exposes the ways in which men's rights advocates disqualify women's experiences and the responses to such claims.

Defining Appropriate Stages of Change for Intimate Partner Violence Survivors

Author: Burke, Jessica Griffin; Mahoney, Patricia; Gielen, Andrea; McDonnell, Karen A; O'Campo, Patricia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61790886?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recent research suggests that the transtheoretical model of behavior change is a promising approach for interventions addressing women's experiences of intimate partner violence. This study explores the distribution of abused women across the stages of change for (a) staying safe from intimate partner violence and (b) leaving an abusive relationship. It explores the relationship between stage assignment and other indicators of a woman's stage (i.e., safety behaviors and desire for services). Quantitative surveys were conducted with 96 low-income, urban abused women recruited from six health care clinics. The findings call into question the appropriateness of using a staging algorithm that uses one 'global' question about keeping safe and suggest that staging questions focused on a single action stage (e.g., leaving) are also problematic. In conclusion, additional work remains to be done to develop and validate quantitative measures of stages of change for survivors of intimate partner violence and to design, implement, and evaluated stage-based, tailored intimate partner violence interventions.

Exploring the Relationship Between Childhood Maltreatment and Intimate Partner Abuse: Gender Differences in the Mediating Role of Emotion Dysregulation

Author: Gratz, Kim L; Paulson, Autumn; Jakupcak, Matthew; Tull, Matthew T

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61457274?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite evidence that childhood maltreatment is associated with increased risk for intimate partner abuse perpetration, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. Given literature suggesting that violent behaviors may serve an emotion regulating function, this study examined the mediating role of emotion dysregulation in the relationship between childhood maltreatment and intimate partner abuse perpetration among 341 male and female undergraduates. However, given evidence of gender differences in the underlying mechanisms of intimate partner abuse, emotion dysregulation was expected to be more relevant to the perpetration of partner abuse among men. Consistent with hypotheses, emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and intimate partner abuse among men; conversely, emotion dysregulation was not associated with partner abuse among women. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Among Hispanic Men and Women: The Role of Drinking, Neighborhood Disorder, and Acculturation-Related Factors

Author: Cunradi, Carol B

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61480844?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using secondary data analysis, this study assessed the contribution of drinking, neighborhood disorder, and acculturation-related factors to past-year intimate partner violence (IPV) risk among a national sample of married or cohabiting Hispanic men (n = 1,148) and women (n = 1,399) who participated in the 2000 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. Drinking measures were past-year alcohol abuse, past-month binge drinking, and number of past-year drinking days. Neighborhood disorder was measured by perceived level of neighborhood problems. Acculturation-related factors were nativity and survey interview language preference (Spanish vs. English). Similar proportions of men and women reported IPV perpetration (6.1% vs. 6.5%) and IPV victimization (8.8% vs. 7.8%). Logistic regression results indicated that for men, neighborhood disorder was associated with IPV perpetration (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55) and victimization (OR = 1.36). For women, neighborhood disorder (OR = 1.34) and their alcohol abuse (OR = 10.26) were associated with IPV victimization, but not IPV perpetration. Acculturation-related factors were not associated with IPV perpetration or victimization for men or women. The findings suggest that IPV prevention efforts should address deleterious neighborhood conditions in addition to individual-level factors that place couples at risk for IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Community Service Needs Among Pregnant and Postpartum Latina Women

Author: Eisenman, David P; Richardson, Erin; Sumner, Lekeisha A; Ahmed, Sawssan R; Liu, Honghu; Valentine, Jeannette; Rodriguez, Michael

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61790902?accountid=14925

Abstract: Health care providers are advised to refer abused women to needed community services. However, little is known about abused women's perceived need for services, particularly among Latina women. We examined the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and perceived needs for legal, social, and job services among a prospective cohort of 210 pregnant Latinas. IPV was associated with needing social and legal services at most time points. Women with recent IPV experiences reported greater service needs than women with more remote IPV experiences, who in turn reported greater need than women without IPV experiences. We conclude that IPV may be associated with ongoing perceived needs for social and legal services among Latina perinatal patients. Adapted from the source document.

Reducing Domestic Violence and Other Criminal Recidivism: Effectiveness of a Multilevel Batterers Intervention Program

Author: Coulter, Martha; Vandeweerd, Carla

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61790162?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study evaluated whether the use of a multilevel system of intervention based on batterer assessment resulted in lowered risk of re-arrests for both domestic violence and other crimes. The study conducted analysis of data from 1995 to 2004, including initial arrest and program placement information and re-arrest rates for 17,999 individual batterers. The study found that recidivism rates were substantially lower for participants who completed the programs when compared to those who did not and that the re-arrest rates were substantially lower than are generally found in the literature on batterer recidivism. The study provides guidance to batterers intervention programs in approaches to designing countywide programs that are most effective in reducing recidivism in domestic violence batterers.

Intimate Partner Violence Experience and Expectations Among College Women in Dating Relationships: Implications for Behavioral Interventions

Author: Stein, Amanda L; Tran, Giao Q; Fisher, Bonnie S

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61412067?accountid=14925

Abstract: Studies suggest that experience and expectations of intimate partner violence (IPV) among college women may be positively related. We investigated their association using modified versions of two standard measures: the Conflict Tactics Scale and the Multidimensional Emotional Abuse Scale. Five hundred and thirty-four college women completed each measure twice: once based on their partner's actual behaviors and once based on what they expected a male partner would do in a relationship. Results demonstrated that IPV experience and IPV expectations are significantly and positively related. Results also showed that respondents expected more IPV than they reportedly experienced, suggesting that college women may believe that IPV occurs more frequently in others' relationships than in their own. Findings suggest that behavioral interventions for IPV victims should address IPV expectations. Adapted from the source document.

Helping Women Victims of Intimate Partner Violence: Comparing the Approaches of Two Health Care Settings

Author: Chang, Judy C; Buranosky, Raquel; Dado, Diane; Cluss, Patricia; Hawker, Lynn; Rothe, Elizabeth; McNeil, Melissa; Scholle, Sarah H

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61790262?accountid=14925

Abstract: Health professionals from two different clinical settings were asked about their comfort level in dealing with intimate partner violence (IPV). Focus groups and semistructured interviews were used to gather information. Staff in an obstetrics and gynecology setting relatively rich in IPV resources described feeling capable dealing with IPV. The staff in a general medicine setting dedicated to women's health but without a focus on IPV and with fewer supports described discomfort and difficulty dealing with IPV. Presence of systemic prioritization of and resources for IPV were described as contributing to the confidence in addressing the issue. Other necessary elements identified included (a) on-site resources, (b) adequate time, (c) focused IPV training, and (d) a team or systemic approach. Adapted from the source document.

Alcohol Use in Nonmutual and Mutual Domestic Violence in the U.S. Army: 1998-2004

Author: McCarroll, James E; Fan, Zizhong; Bell, Nicole S

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61456823?accountid=14925

Abstract: The association between alcohol use and substantiated incidents of nonmutual and mutual domestic violence between U.S. Army enlisted soldiers and their spouses was examined for the period 1998-2004. Maltreatment was always more severe in nonmutual incidents. Female victims experienced more severe maltreatment than males. Male offenders and victims were more likely to be drinking than females. For victims of both sexes, severity was greater when offenders were drinking. Older males were more likely to be offenders in nonmutual incidents. White males were more likely than Black or Hispanic males to be offenders in nonmutual incidents. There is a need for both domestic violence and alcohol treatment programs to focus on the increased risk of abuse when alcohol is involved. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Risk for Depression Among Postpartum Women in Lima, Peru

Author: Gomez-Beloz, Alfredo; Williams, Michelle A; Sanchez, Sixto E; Lam, Nelly

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61456787?accountid=14925

Abstract: A cross-sectional study of 2,317 women who delivered at Instituto Nacional Materno Perinatal, Lima, Peru, was carried out to evaluate risk of depression in relation to maternal experience with intimate partner violence (IPV) before and during pregnancy. Depression severity was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Subset (PHQ-9). The prevalence of IPV during lifetime and pregnancy was 44% and 21%, respectively. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each level of depression severity associated with history of IPV during pregnancy were: mild 1.4 (1.9-2.3); moderate 2.9 (1.8-4.5); moderately severe 5.5 (3.4-9.2); and severe 9.9 (5.1-19.9). A positive gradient was observed for severity of depression and IPV during pregnancy (trend p < 0.001). Postpartum women who experienced IPV during pregnancy had higher levels of depression severity than did nonabused women. Adapted from the source document.

Male Soldier Family Violence Offenders: Spouse and Child Offenders Compared to Child Offenders

Author: Martin, Sandra L1; Gibbs, Deborah A; Johnson, Ruby E; Rentz, E Danielle; Clinton-Sherrod, Monique; Hardison Walters, Jennifer L; Sullivan, Kristen1 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389776?accountid=14925

Abstract: Army data from 2000 to 2004 were used to compare two groups of married, male, Army soldier, first-time family violence offenders: 760 dual offenders (whose initial incident included both child maltreatment and spouse abuse) and 2,209 single offenders (whose initial incident included only child maltreatment). The majority (81%) of dual offenders perpetrated physical spouse abuse; however, dual offenders were less likely than single offenders to perpetrate physical child abuse (16% vs. 42%) or sexual child abuse (1% vs. 11%), but they were more likely to perpetrate emotional child abuse (45% vs. 12%). These findings may be, at least in part, explained in light of the Army Family Advocacy Program policy, which considers spouse offenders as also being emotional child abuse offenders since children may be traumatized by exposure to spouse abuse. Adapted from the source document.

Official Incidents of Domestic Violence: Types, Injury, and Associations With Nonofficial Couple Aggression

Author: Capaldi, Deborah M1; Shortt, Joann Wu; Kim, Hyoun K; Wilson, Jane; Crosby, Lynn; Tucci, Shivan1 Oregon Social Learning Center, Eugene

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59984822?accountid=14925

Abstract: Official police reports of intimate partner violence (IPV) were examined in a community sample of young, at-risk couples to determine the degree of mutuality and the relation between IPV arrests and aggression toward a partner (self-reported, partner reported, and observed). Arrests were predominantly of the men. Men were more likely to initiate physical contact, use physical force, and inflict injuries than women, although few injuries required medical attention. In the context of nonofficial aggression toward a partner, overall, women had higher levels of physical and psychological aggression compared to men, and levels of severe physical aggression did not differ by gender. Couples with an IPV arrest were more aggressive toward each other than couples with no IPV arrests; however, nonofficial levels of aggression were not higher for men than for women among couples experiencing an IPV incident.

Intimate Partner Violence Screening and Pregnant Latinas

Author: Rodriguez, Michael1; Shoultz, Jan; Richardson, Erin1 University of California, Los Angeles

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59975406?accountid=14925

Abstract: Little is known about factors associated with health care screening of intimate partner violence (IPV) for Latinas during pregnancy. This study builds on current research examining IPV-associated outcomes among Latinas by analyzing 210 pregnant Latina responses to a patient survey. A multivariate logistic regression model examined factors associated with being screened for IPV. One-third of pregnant women reported being screened for IPV. Factors related to being screened for IPV are reported and did not match those associated with having experienced IPV. While most pregnant Latinas were not screened for IPV, having systematic processes in place for IPV screening and fostering good patient-provider communication may facilitate identification of IPV. Having a greater awareness of the risk factors associated with IPV may also provide cues for clinicians to better address the issue of IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Gender Variations in Dating Violence and Positive Conflict Resolution Among Mexican Adolescents

Author: Antonio, Tiago1; Hokoda, Audrey1 San Diego State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59994186?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study examined gender variations on dating violence and conflict resolution among Mexican adolescents. Two hundred and eighty-five high school students, aged 15 to 18 years, were recruited in Monterrey, Mexico. Verbal-emotional abuse was positively related to physical abuse and negatively associated with engagement of positive conflict resolution. No gender differences were found in physical abuse, verbal-emotional abuse, and positive conflict resolution. The findings have implications for the development of teen relationship violence intervention programs that focus on teaching positive conflict resolution skills to Mexican youth. Adapted from the source document.

Mortality of Women From Intimate Partner Violence in South Africa: A National Epidemiological Study

Author: Abrahams, Naeemah1; Jewkes, Rachel; Martin, Lorna J; Mathews, Shanaaz; Vetten, Lisa; Lombard, Carl1 San Diego State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389546?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to describe mortality of women from intimate partner violence (IPV) in South Africa using a retrospective national study in a proportionate random sample of 25 mortuaries. Homicides identified from mortuary, autopsy, and police records. There were 3,797 female homicides, of which 50.3% were from IPV. The mortality rate from IPV was 8.8 per 100,000 women. Mortality from IPV were elevated among those 14 to 44 years and women of color. Blunt force injuries were more common, while strangulation or asphyxiation were less common. The national IPV mortality rate was more than twice that found in the United States. The study highlights the value of collecting reliable data across the globe to develop interventions for advocacy of which gender equity is critical. Adapted from the source document.

Subtypes of Alcohol and Intimate Partner Violence: A Latent Class Analysis

Author: Klostermann, Keith; Mignone, Theresa; Chen, Rui

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61361271?accountid=14925

Abstract: The investigation explored whether subtypes of relapse to violence exist for different levels of intimate partner violence and drinking behavior among men who relapse to both alcohol and violence after alcoholism treatment. Male clients entering an alcoholism treatment program who reported at least one incident of intimate partner violence and their female partners (N = 294) were recruited for participation. Data were analyzed using a latent class analysis of mixture model. Findings revealed that two classes of violence best described the sample of men that relapsed to violence. Class 1 contained males who had perpetrated more days of violence, relapsed to violence faster, more frequently relapsed to alcohol, and had a higher percentage of males identified as meeting diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder compared to those in class 2. Adapted from the source document.

The Relationship Between Dating Violence and Psychosocial Problems in a Sample of Adolescent Pregnancy Termination Patients

Author: Ely, Gretchen E; Nugent, William R; Flaherty, Chris

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60311237?accountid=14925

Abstract: The relationship between dating violence and 13 psychosocial problems, conceptually organized into three symptom clusters-depressive, family problem, and posttraumatic stress-was investigated in a sample of adolescent pregnancy termination patients, ages 14 to 21. Results of a multivariate multiple-regression analysis indicated that, after controlling for age, ethnicity, general aggression problems, and problems with peers, dating violence was significantly related with the symptoms clusters. At the univariate level, the results suggested that dating violence was significantly related with self-esteem problems, guilt, and suicidal thinking from the depressive symptoms cluster and with guilt and stress from the posttraumatic stress cluster. The implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

The Domestic Violence Home-Visit Intervention: Impact on Police-Reported Incidents of Repeat Violence Over 12 Months

Author: Stover, Carla Smith; Poole, Gina; Marans, Steven

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60310256?accountid=14925

Abstract: The domestic violence home-visit intervention (DVHVI) provides home visits by police-advocate teams within 72-hours of domestic incident to provide safety, psychoeducation, mental health, legal, or additional police assistance. Clinical and police record data were collected for 512 cases, and repeat calls to the police were tracked for 12 months. Analyses revealed that women who engaged with the DVHVI were more likely to contact the police for subsequent events than those who received no or minimal DVHVI contact. Hispanic women served by Spanish-speaking advocate-officer teams were the most likely to utilize services and call the police for subsequent incidents. Adapted from the source document.

Age, Period, and Cohort Effects on Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Rivara, Frederick P; Anderson, Melissa L; Fishman, Paul; Reid, Robert J; Bonomi, Amy E; Carrell, David; Thompson, Robert S

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60311267?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study sought to determine if the recent secular decrease in reported intimate partner violence (IPV) in women was due to cohort or period effects. Women ages 18 to 64 were interviewed about IPV during their adult lifetimes. The lifetime prevalence of any IPV was 42%. Regardless of birth cohort, IPV was most common among women in their mid-20s to early 30s. After adjusting for cohort and period effects, women 26 to 30 had the highest risk of any IPV; risk decreased with age. Younger birth cohorts were at decreased risk for IPV. The estimated risk is lowest for those born between 1966 and 1975, with 31% lower risk of IPV than those born in 1946-1955. There was a substantial drop in IPV for all age-groups beginning in the 1990s. Adapted from the source document.

Women's Appraisals of Intimate Partner Violence Stressfulness and Their Relationship to Depressive and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms

Author: Martinez-Torteya, Cecilia; Bogat, G Anne; Eye, Alexander von; Levendosky, Alytia A; Davidson, William S, II

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60325383?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) increases risk for depressive and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Most studies use a dose-response approach to examine the impact of IPV on mental health, but they often fail to explain mental health outcome specificity as well as to assess the impact of women's subjective appraisals. The present research examined women's IPV stressfulness appraisals and their psychological functioning (depressive and PTSD symptoms). Results indicate that IPV stressfulness appraisals are associated with depressive symptoms over and above frequency and severity of IPV. PTSD symptoms were associated with frequent and stressful IPV. Women who experienced highly frequent and highly stressful IPV were most likely to display comorbid depressive and PTSD symptoms. Results underscore the importance of women's subjective experiences and the heterogeneity of women's responses to IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Prevalence and Correlates of Intimate Partner Violence Victimization Among Men and Women Entering Substance Use Disorder Treatment

Author: Schneider, Renee; Burnette, Mandi L; Ilgen, Mark A; Timko, Christine

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61354601?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence victimization was examined in men (N = 4,459) and women (N = 1,774) entering substance use disorder treatment. Nearly 1 in 2 women and 1 in 10 men reported lifetime victimization by an intimate partner. Entering treatment for alcohol, as compared to drug abuse and history of childhood abuse, were each associated with intimate partner violence victimization. Victimization by an intimate partner was also associated with mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and attempted suicide. Although victimization was linked to physical health problems, the nature of these problems varied by gender. Women and men with a history of intimate partner victimization present to substance use disorder treatment with a complex array of mental and physical health problems. Adapted from the source document.

Exploring Mexican-Origin Intimate Partner Abuse Survivors' Help-Seeking Within Their Sociocultural Contexts

Author: Brabeck, Kalina M; Guzman, Michele R

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61355419?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women's responses to partner abuse are shaped by their particular sociocultural contexts. In this study, quantitative data were collected from 75 Mexican-origin women who survived intimate partner abuse, to identify variables associated with help-seeking to survive relationship abuse. Help-seeking was defined as use of formal (e.g., shelter) and informal (e.g., family) sources. Variables included two cultural variables: machismo (i.e., adherence to traditional gender roles) and familismo (i.e., valuing family cohesion and reciprocity), and four sociostructural variables: income, education, English proficiency, and immigrant status. Results indicated participants with higher levels of familismo sought informal help more frequently than those with lower levels. Women with grade school education, no English proficiency, and undocumented status sought formal help less frequently than those not constrained by these barriers. Adapted from the source document.

'You Can't Bite the Hand . . .': Domestic Violence and Human Rights

Author: Morgaine, Karen11 California State University, Northridge karen.morgaine@csun.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61442829?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines whether the international 'women's rights as human rights' movement has influenced the field of domestic violence in the United States and the possible barriers to redefining domestic violence as a violation of human rights. The qualitative study that is presented was based on semistructured interviews with key individuals throughout the United States who work in national organizations on issues of domestic violence and/or human rights. The findings focus on the manner in which power situated within the state would result in significant barriers to reframing domestic violence related to themes of resonance, U.S. exceptionalism, funding, and the criminal justice system.

Gender Variation in Partner Abuse. Findings From a Conservative Christian Denomination

Author: Drumm, Rene D1; Popescu, Marciana; Riggs, Matt L1 Southern Adventist University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/812989474?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines three areas of intimate partner violence in a conservative Christian denomination, noting gender differences in patterns of abuse among men and women. Specifically investigating patterns of victimization, the study identifies women as targets of intimate terrorism. Women who experienced escalating violence and sexual violence also reported emotional abuse, controlling behaviors, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that are typical of intimate terrorism. Women who endured potentially lethal violence had the added associated action of calling the police or 911. Although factors that are associated with male victimization also feature controlling behaviors, the control is not associated with PTSD or associated fear behaviors that are typical of intimate terrorism.

Repeated reports for child maltreatment among intimate partner violence victims: Findings from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being

Author: Casanueva, Cecilia1; Martin, Sandra L; Runyan, Desmond K1 RTI International, 3040 Cornwallis Road, PO Box 12194, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-2194, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743057398?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objectives: To determine the prevalence of intimate partner violence (defined as any physical violence during the last 12 months or previously) among mothers who maltreat their children, and to examine whether mothers' experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV) are associated with repeated reports (rereports) of children to Child Protective Services (CPS) during the following 18 months. Methods: Data for the analyses were from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW), a national probability study of children investigated for child maltreatment. The sample of 5,501 children (ages 0-14) was randomly selected from the families who entered the US child welfare system between October 1999 and December 2000. The analysis sample was restricted to 1,236 families in which caregivers were: (1) the alleged perpetrators of the child maltreatment at baseline (independently of substantiation status) and (2) the biological mothers (n = 1,212 or 98.6%), adoptive mothers (n = 17 or 1%), or stepmothers (n = 7 or 0.3%) of children not placed in out-of-home care. Results: Children of mothers physically abused by an intimate partner during the last 12 months or previously at the intake interview (44%) were twice as likely as children of mothers who had not experienced such violence to be rereported to CPS (29% vs. 14%, Odds Ratio = 2.0, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.1-3.4). Rereports occurred almost twice as quickly for children of mothers who experienced IPV compared to children of mothers who had not experienced IPV (Hazard Ratio = 1.9, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.1-3.0). Conclusions: The higher risk and speedier rereports of child maltreatment associated with intimate partner violence highlights the need for universal assessment and provision of services for IPV among families that are investigated by CPS.

Children's adjustment problems in families characterized by men's severe violence toward women: Does other family violence matter?

Author: McDonald, Renee1; Jouriles, Ernest N; Tart, Candyce D; Minze, Laura C1 Dept Psychology, Southern Methodist U, PO Box 750442, Dallas, TX 75275-0442, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743052705?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: This research examined whether additional forms of family violence (partner-child aggression, mother-child aggression, and women's intimate partner violence [IPV]) contribute to children's adjustment problems in families characterized by men's severe violence toward women. Methods: Participants were 258 children and their mothers recruited from domestic violence shelters. Mothers and children completed measures of men's IPV, women's IPV, partner-child aggression, and mother-child aggression. Mothers provided reports of children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems; children provided reports of their appraisals of threat in relation to interparent conflict. Results: After controlling for sociodemographics and men's IPV: (1) each of the additional forms of family violence (partner-child aggression, mother-child aggression, and women's IPV) was associated with children's externalizing problems; (2) partner-child aggression was associated with internalizing problems; and (3) partner-child aggression was associated with children's threat appraisals. The relation of mother-child aggression to externalizing problems was stronger for boys than for girls; gender differences were not observed for internalizing problems or threat appraisals. Conclusions: Men's severe IPV seldom occurs in the absence of other forms of family violence, and these other forms appear to contribute to children's adjustment problems. Parent-child aggression, and partner-child aggression in particular, are especially important. Systematic efforts to identify shelter children who are victims of parental violence seem warranted. Practice implications: Men's severe IPV seldom occurs in the absence of other forms of family violence (partner-child aggression, mother-child aggression, and women's IPV), and these different forms of family violence all contribute to children's adjustment problems. Treatment programs for children who come to domestic violence shelters should address these different forms of family violence, especially parent-child aggression. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

Sleep disruption and domestic violence: exploring the interconnections between mothers and children

Author: Humphreys, Cathy1; Lowe, Pam; Williams, Simon1 Professor, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia cathy.humphreys@unimelb.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61380706?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper argues that sleep disruption is both a strategy and an effect of violence and abuse which profoundly affects the lives of women and children. This paper traces the interconnections between the patterns of sleeping (not sleeping) for women and children living with and recovering from the effects of violence and abuse. It highlights the threat to the emotional and physical well-being of children and women and provides a non-pathologizing route into an exploration of one of the symptoms of trauma. It is based on a pilot study which interviewed 17 women, 14 of whom were mothers to 28 children. Mothers reported that many of their children experienced nightmares, bed-wetting, night panics and disrupted sleep patterns. Recovery of the ability to sleep was often slow and uneven with interactive effects between women and children slowing progress. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic violence crimes and children: A population-based investigation of direct sensory exposure and the nature of involvement

Author: Fusco, Rachel A1; Fantuzzo, John W1 School of Social Work, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States

Abstract: Children's exposure to domestic violence is a major national problem. Researchers and policymakers have called for research guided by comprehensive conceptual frameworks to advance understanding of this complex risk to children's well-being [Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2006). Preventing intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and child maltreatment. Retrieved June 3, 2006 from http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/pub-res/research_agenda/07_violence.htm.; National Institute of Justice (2007). Adolescents, neighborhoods, and violence: Recent findings from the Project on Human Development. Retrieved on September 5, 2007 from http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/217397.pdf). The present study used a developmental-epidemiological model to explore the prevalence and nature of children's exposure to and involvement in domestic violence crimes investigated by law enforcement across a population. During the year under study 1581 domestic violence crimes were investigated by law enforcement. Forty-three percent of all domestic violence crimes had children in the household, and nearly all of those children (95%) experienced sensory exposure to the violence. A logistic regression model revealed a relationship between child exposure and domestic violence event characteristics such as victim injury, mutual assault, and perpetrator arrest. This research also examined how children are involved in domestic violence events. Three distinct types of involvement were revealed: children were part of the precipitating event; children called for help; and children were physically involved. Findings highlight the importance of developing a comprehensive surveillance system to ensure children exposed to domestic violence are made visible so they can be referred to appropriate services.

Police release with conditions of the accused in cases of domestic violence in Montreal, Canada

Author: Gauthier, Sonia11 University of Montreal, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61383421?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents the results of a study conducted in Montreal (Canada) on how police use their power to release an accused on bail with conditions in incidents of domestic violence, which was granted to them in 1995. Interviews conducted in 2000 with police investigators and lieutenant-detectives revealed that police view this measure favourably. It allows them to release the accused on bail before his first appearance by monitoring him with conditions. According to police, this both reassures and protects the victim and avoids the need to detain the accused just to have conditions imposed by the court. While investigators found the decision to detain or release to be difficult at times, they also felt they were as capable as judicial officials in making the decision to release on bail. The police respondents explained why and how they are prudent in their assessment of the risks associated with release. Future research should evaluate to what degree the conditions they impose are adequate. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright 2009.]

Destabilizing homonormativity and the public/private dichotomy in North American lesbian domestic violence discourses

Author: Holmes, Cindy11 University of British Columbia, Kelowna, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61757639?accountid=14925

Abstract: Developing and circulating community-based educational materials and offering workshops are common feminist approaches to addressing violence in lesbian relationships. This article explores the racialized exclusions in the public/private dichotomy in community-based educational discourses about 'lesbian domestic violence'. An examination of community-based educational materials and interviews with lesbian and queer feminist educators illustrates how the public/private dichotomy produces exclusions and makes certain forms of violence enacted on certain bodies unthinkable and unintelligible. While these discourses challenge heteronormative constructions of violence, they have relied on a simple conceptual framework that has had the effect of promoting a dominant narrative or regime of truth privileging white, middle-class lesbian experiences. This article seeks to destabilize homonormative constructions by arguing for an anti-colonial feminist spatial analysis of violence in same-sex/gender relationships. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Parental Divorce as Predictors of Best Friendship Qualities Among College Students

Author: Green, Julii M1; King, Alan R1 c/o King -- Department of Psychology, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, North Dakota, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61447029?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data regarding the effects of domestic violence and parental divorce have been inconsistent. Assessments of the effects of childhood trauma on psychosocial adjustment might be enhanced by an examination of the way developmental stressors interact. A total of 370 college students with histories of combinations of parental divorce and domestic violence participated in this correlational study of best friendships in early adulthood. College students exposed to domestic violence during childhood described their best friendships as relatively less reinforcing, helpful, and sustainable than those without the abuse history. Participants from intact families, as compared to those with parental divorce histories, described their best friendship as relatively more reinforcing and favorable. The combination of parental divorce and exposure to domestic violence was linked to magnified effects regarding these best friendship qualities. Average effect sizes for domestic violence (d = .31), parental divorce (d = .18), and the interaction between domestic abuse and divorce (d = .85) pointed to mild to modest links between these stressors and best friendship qualities. These results emphasized the benefits of interaction analysis in attempts to predict the adverse effects of developmental stressors on late psychological functioning.

Problem Drinking, Unemployment, and Intimate Partner Violence among a Sample of Construction Industry Workers and their Partners

Author: Cunradi, Carol B1; Todd, Michael; Duke, Michael; Ames, Genevieve1 Prevention Research Center, Pacific Institute for Research & Evaluation, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 450, Berkeley, CA, 94704, USA, Cunradi@prev.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811846936?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to determine the contribution of male unemployment and each partner's problem drinking to risk for male-to-female partner violence (MFPV) and female-to-male partner violence (FMPV) among a sample of construction industry workers and their spouses/partners. Participants in the sample (n = 848 couples) completed cross-sectional health behavior surveys. Multivariate logistic regression models of MFPV and FMPV, with adjustment for demographic and psychosocial variables, were developed. Approximately 20% of couples reported MFPV, and 24% reported FMPV. Results indicated that couples in which the male was a problem drinker, and in which the male worker reported being currently unemployed, were at risk for MFPV. Number of months unemployed by the male worker was significantly associated with FMPV, but problem drinking was not associated with this outcome. Male and female impulsivity were significantly associated with risk for MFPV and FMPV, and the male's report of adverse childhood events was associated with increased likelihood of MFPV. There was no evidence for the effects of unemployment being moderated (exacerbated) by problem drinking. Workplace-based prevention efforts may be a feasible and important strategy to reduce problem drinking and partner violence among high-risk occupational groups.

Perceived Risk for Future Intimate Partner Violence among Women in a Domestic Violence Shelter

Author: Harding, Hilary G1; Helweg-Larsen, Marie1 Department of Psychology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA, hharding@uga.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811795892?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research investigating women's risk assessments for intimate partner violence (IPV) shows that women can predict future violence with relative accuracy. Limited research has investigated factors that are associated with perceived risk and the potential behavioral consequences of victim risk perception. Results from a survey of women in a domestic violence shelter (N=56) indicated that women perceive lower risk of future violence if the abusive relationship were to end and higher risk of violence if it were to continue. Certain abuse experiences were related to elevated perceptions of personal risk for future violence. Further, perceived personal risk predicted the women's intention to terminate their relationship upon leaving shelter. Results are discussed as they may inform interventions preventing IPV.

Perceptions of Same-sex Domestic Violence Among Crisis Center Staff

Author: Brown, Michael J1; Groscup, Jennifer1 Department of Psychology, Brooklyn College, CUNY, 5401 James Hall, 2900 Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11210, USA mbrown@brooklyn.cuny.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61439895?accountid=14925

Abstract: Crisis center staff help form the frontline in the fight against domestic violence. Therefore, it is important that we understand any biases they may have when addressing cases of same-sex domestic violence. In this study, 120 crisis center staff members were given a vignette depicting a domestic dispute and asked to complete a questionnaire about their perceptions of the incident and the parties involved. We manipulated the sex of the perpetrator and victim. All other aspects of the vignette remained consistent. Because gay and lesbian relationships are often perceived as less serious than heterosexual relationships, we hypothesized that participants would perceive same-sex domestic violence as such. Consistent with this hypothesis, participants rated same-sex domestic violence scenarios as less serious than opposite-sex domestic violence and as less likely to get worse over time.

Intimate Partner Violence Among Sexual Minorities in Japan: Exploring Perceptions and Experiences

Author: Distefano, Anthony S11 Department of Health Science, California State University, Fullerton, Fullerton, California, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61761859?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using qualitative interviews (n = 39) and participant observation (n = 54), this study documents perceptions and experiences of violence between lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex intimate partners in Japan, thereby providing exploratory, formative data on a previously unexamined issue. Results indicate that intimate partner violence (IPV) is experienced physically, sexually, and psychologically in all sexual minority groups. Participants perceived the violence to be: a) very similar to heterosexual IPV against women; b) more likely perpetrated and experienced by lesbians, bisexual women, and transgender persons compared to gay and bisexual men and intersex persons; c) the cause of several negative physical and mental health outcomes; and d) largely unrecognized in both sexual minority communities and broader Japanese society. Adapted from the source document.

Impact of Emergency Department Intimate Partner Violence Intervention

Author: Kendall, Jayne1; Pelucio, Maria Tereza; Casaletto, Jennifer; Thompson, Karen Parker; Barnes, Sherry; Pettit, Erin; Aldrich, Mae1 Gaston Memorial Hospital

Abstract: The objective of the study is to assess the impact of emergency department (ED) intimate partner violence (IPV) counseling and resource referrals on patient-perceived safety and safety planning. ED patients with risk factors were offered consultation with trained IPV advocacy counselors who completed safety assessments, provided resource referrals, and helped patients develop safety plans. Patients were contacted after ED intervention to assess progress and further assist in IPV counseling. Over 96% of patients perceived an increase in their safety after the intervention, and approximately 50% had completed a portion of their safety plan. Legal assistance and/or law enforcement were considered the most beneficial resource referrals. Although follow-up was limited, this study appears to demonstrate that an ED IPV intervention program may be useful in helping IPV victims achieve safer living environments and access local resources.

Detection of Intimate Partner Violence in a General Medicine Practice

Author: Soglin, Lenore F1; Bauchat, Jeanette; Soglin, David F; Martin, Gary J1 Northwestern University Medical School

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61441924?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this study, an assessment phase is undertaken to determine intimate partner violence (IPV) prevalence. An anonymous survey is followed by a chart review documenting identification of IPV. Two methods are attempted to increase assessment/documentation of IPV: a physician educational intervention and a nursing routine inquiry intervention in one quadrant of the practice. The IPV physician educational intervention includes didactic sessions, an IPV counselor, and resource information. The routine inquiry intervention involves nurses screening female patients for IPV at check-in. IPV is found to be prevalent in a general medicine clinic. An enhanced educational intervention does not increase IPV documentation. A routine inquiry intervention significantly increases documentation of lifetime IPV but does not impact current IPV identification. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright.]

A Preliminary Study of Intimate Partner Violence Among Nepali Women in the United States

Author: Thapa-Oli, Soni1; Dulal, Hari Bansha; Baba, Yoko1 Texas Woman's University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61437096?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although there is a growing number of studies on intimate partner violence (IPV) in U.S. South Asian communities, the examination of IPV among Nepali women in the United States is still in the initial stage. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of and vulnerabilities to IPV among 45 Nepali immigrant women residing in the New York metropolitan area. The findings demonstrated that 75.6% of women had been verbally insulted by their current partners, and 62.2% had to seek permission from their partners to go to their friends' or relatives' houses.

Prevalence, Types, and Pattern of Intimate Partner Violence Among Pregnant Women in Lima, Peru

Author: Perales, Maria Teresa1; Cripe, Swee May; Lam, Nelly; Sanchez, Sixto E; Sanchez, Elena; Williams, Michelle Anne1 Pediatric Emergency Hospital

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61707547?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study assesses the prevalence, types, and pattern of intimate partner violence (IPV) during lifetime and current pregnancy for 2,392 women in Lima, Peru. The reported lifetime prevalence of any IPV (physical, sexual, or emotional) is 45.1%. For women who experienced abuse, the prevalence of lifetime physical, emotional, and sexual IPV is 34.2%, 28.4%, and 8.7%, respectively. Older (^D#> 30 years), unmarried, employed, and economically disadvantaged women and those with little education are more likely to experience lifetime and pregnancy IPV. Efforts at universal antepartum IPV screening and appropriate interventions are needed to reduce the burden of violence experienced by pregnant women.

Training child protective services workers about domestic violence: Needs, strategies, and barriers

Author: Button, Deeanna M; Payne, Brian K

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61355607?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research demonstrates a strong relationship between child abuse and domestic violence. This study assesses the domestic violence training needs of child protective services workers. Surveys were completed by 187 social services supervisors in Virginia. Attention was given to the training needs of child protective services workers, how those needs compare to the domestic violence training needs of other social services workers, the strategies identified as most effective, and barriers to training. Results suggest that child protective services workers presumably know more about domestic violence than other workers, but they need more knowledge in certain areas. Implications are provided.

Understanding the Complexity of Alcohol-Related Intimate Partner Violence in the Lives of Hispanic Men Who Have Sex with Men: Methodological Issues and Considerations

Author: Peralta, Robert L1; Ross, Jodi1 Department of Sociology, The University of Akron, Olin Hall 260, Akron, OH 44325-1905, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61766523?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to highlight methodological issues and considerations which will be of use to researchers interested in further understanding the complexity of intimate partner violence in the lives of Hispanic men who have sex with men. We present a brief review of the research on intimate partner violence which highlights intersections of health and behavior risk factors (i.e., alcohol-related-intimate-partner-violence and HIV/AIDS risk) pertaining to gender, ethnicity, and sexuality in this population of males. We then present the reader with a synthesis and critique of several methodological concerns relevant to furthering research in this area including: locating participants, considerations of the impact of local cultural contexts, and impact of researcher positionality. Research recommendations for addressing intimate partner violence as a complex public health concern embedded in 'hidden populations' conclude the paper. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic violence against women: Understanding social processes and women's experiences

Author: Bostock, Jan1; Plumpton, Maureen; Pratt, Rebekah1 Primary Care Mental Health Practitioner, North Tyneside Primary Care Mental Health Team, Northumberland Tyne and Wear NHS Trust, The Oxford Centre, West Farm Avenue, Longbenton, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61731710?accountid=14925

Abstract: The prevalence of domestic abuse against women has been estimated as high as one in four. The risk is particularly high for women who are younger, economically dependent, unemployed and with children. Research about the factors that maintain situations of abuse has generally focused separately on the coping strategies of women, barriers to leaving the relationship and the perpetrators' means of abuse. In this study we used a community psychology perspective to seek a broader understanding of what maintains situations of abuse, in order to suggest interventions in a rural County in the North of England. Twelve women who had experienced domestic abuse and had used voluntary sector services agreed to be interviewed about their experiences and the resources and strategies available to them. Using grounded theory we generated four themes: (1) Commonalities and contradictions in the experience of abuse; (2) living with abuse; (3) the response of systems reinforced or challenged the abuse and (4) dealing with abuse beyond the relationship. These findings illustrate how situations of domestic abuse can be prolonged by limited options available to victims for support and protection, and a lack of active public acknowledgement that domestic abuse is unacceptable.

Nonviolent Aspects of Interparental Conflict and Dating Violence Among Adolescents

Author: Tschann, Jeanne M1; Pasch, Lauri A; Flores, Elena; VanOss Marin, Barbara; Marco Baisch, E; Wibbelsman, Charles J1 University of California, San Francisco, tschannj@healthpsych.ucsf.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/289920990?accountid=14925

Abstract: This longitudinal study examined whether nonviolent aspects of interparental conflict, in addition to interparental violence, predicted dating violence perpetration and victimization among 150 Mexican American and European American male and female adolescents, ages 16 to 20. When parents had more frequent conflict, were more verbally aggressive during conflict, had poor conflict resolution, or were physically violent during conflict at baseline, adolescents were more involved in dating violence, both perpetration and victimization, at 1-year follow-up. Adolescents' appraisals of parental conflict and their emotional distress mediated the relationships between nonviolent parental conflict and dating violence. In contrast, interparental violence directly predicted involvement in dating violence. Results provide support for the importance of nonviolent parental conflict as an influence on adolescents' involvement in dating violence, over and above the influence of interparental violence. Cognitive and emotional processes may help explain the way in which nonviolent aspects of parental conflict influence adolescents' behavior in romantic relationships.

Unemployment Among Women: Examining the Relationship of Physical and Psychological Intimate Partner Violence and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

Author: Kimerling, Rachel1; Alvarez, Jennifer; Pavao, Joanne; Mack, Katelyn P; Smith, Mark W; Baumrind, Nikki1 VA Palo Alto Health Care System

Abstract: Prior research has demonstrated that intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with employment instability among poor women. The current study assesses the broader relationship between IPV and women's workforce participation in a population-based sample of 6,698 California women. We examined past-year IPV by analyzing specific effects of physical violence, psychological violence, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as predictors of unemployment. Results indicated substantial rates of unemployment among women who reported IPV, with rates of 20% among women who experienced psychological violence, 18% among women who experienced physical violence, and 19% among women with PTSD symptoms. When the relationship was adjusted for demographic characteristics and educational attainment, PTSD (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22, 2.09) and psychological violence (AOR = 1.78; 95% CI = 1.36, 2.32), but not physical violence, were associated with unemployment. Implications for supported employment programs and workplace responses to IPV are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Double Standards in Sentence Structure. Passive Voice in Narratives Describing Domestic Violence

Author: Frazer, Alexandra K1; Miller, Michelle D1 Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/813005776?accountid=14925

Abstract: Previous research has shown that passive voice predominates in mass media reports describing male violence against women. However, there has been little systematic study of narratives describing female violence against men. The authors analyzed the impact of perpetrator gender on verb voice, first in a content analysis of published news stories and second in a new procedure for eliciting written narratives with male or female perpetrators. Results reveal an increased frequency of passive voice when perpetrators are male. These findings suggest that writers specifically prefer the passive voice to describe male-on-female violence rather than for violent or negative acts in general.

Prevalence and Correlates of Adolescent Dating Violence in Bangkok, Thailand

Author: Pradubmook-Sherer, Penchan11 Mahidol University, Nakornchaisri, Nakornpathom, 73170 Thailand shspr@mahidol.ac.th

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61351238?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explored the incidence and severity of violence in dating relationships, and identified variables that explain dating violence perpetration by Thai youths. The sample consisted of 1,296 adolescents from high schools, vocational schools, and out-of-school adolescents, between the ages of 14 and 19. Findings indicate that Thai youths maintain very intensive dating relationships. The out-of-school adolescents hold the highest dating violent behaviors. While males' dating violence scores were higher, the females were involved in all types of dating violence, exceeding the males on verbal/emotional violence. The results provide useful information about cultural influences on dating violence, and have practical policy implications for school-based prevention programs and agencies in Thailand. Adapted from the source document.

Living in Partner-violent Families: Developmental Links to Antisocial Behavior and Relationship Violence

Author: Ireland, Timothy O1; Smith, Carolyn A1 Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Niagara University, P.O. Box 1941, Niagara University, NY, 14109, USA, toi@niagara.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/289825105?accountid=14925

Abstract: Links between living in a partner-violent home and subsequent aggressive and antisocial behavior are suggested by the 'cycle of violence' hypothesis derived from social learning theory. Although there is some empirical support, to date, findings have been generally limited to cross-sectional studies predominantly of young children, or retrospective studies of adults. We address this issue with prospective data from the Rochester Youth Development Study (RYDS), an ongoing longitudinal investigation of the development of antisocial behavior in a community sample of 1,000 urban youth followed from age 14 to adulthood. The original panel included 68% African American, 17% Hispanic, and 15% White participants, and was 72.9% male, and 27.1% female. Measures come from a combination of sources including interviews with parents, interviews with youth, and official records. We test the general hypothesis that there is a relationship between living in partner-violent homes during adolescence, and later antisocial behavior and relationship violence. Employing logistic regression and controlling for related covariates, including child physical abuse, we find a significant relationship between exposure to parental violence and adolescent conduct problems. The relationship between exposure to parental violence and measures of antisocial behavior and relationship aggression dissipates in early adulthood, however, exposure to severe parental violence is significantly related to early adulthood violent crime, and intimate partner violence. Our results suggest that exposure to severe parental violence during adolescence is indeed consequential for violent interactions in adulthood.

Modelling the effects of intimate partner violence and access to resources on women's health in the early years after leaving an abusive partner

Author: Ford-Gilboe, Marilyn; Wuest, Judith; Varcoe, Colleen; Davies, Lorraine; Merritt-Gray, Marilyn; Campbell, Jacquelyn; Wilk, Piotr

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61370348?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although the negative health effects of intimate partner violence (IPV) are well documented, little is known about the mechanisms or determinants of health outcomes for women who had left their abusive partners. Using data collected from a community sample of 309 Canadian women who left an abusive partner, we examined whether women's personal, social and economic resources mediate the relationships between the severity of past IPV and current health using structural equation modelling. A good fit was found between the model and data for hypothesized models of mental and physical health. In the mental health model, both the direct and total indirect effects of IPV were significant. In the physical health model, the direct effect of IPV on physical health was about four times as large as the total indirect effects. In both models, more severe past IPV was associated with lower health and women's personal, social, and economic resources, when combined, mediated the relationship between IPV and health. These findings demonstrate that the health outcomes of IPV for women who have left an abusive partner must be understood in context of women's resources. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

Intimate Partner Violence during Pregnancy: What Does the Research Tell Us?

Author: Bergen, Raquel Kennedy1; Logue, Melissa A1 Saint Joseph's University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61766987?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article represents an interdisciplinary review of the current literature on intimate partner violence during pregnancy. Within the field of research, questions have been raised about whether or not women are at heightened risk for experiencing violence during pregnancy. We examined studies in both Western and non-Western contexts to examine this question and consider prevalence rates, causal factors, and the consequences for victims and their fetuses. We found that even with variations in methodology, the literature indicates that violence against women during pregnancy is a serious and complex problem. Women's experiences of violence vary greatly, and while pregnancy may serve as a protective period for some women, for others, pregnancy has been found to increase the violence or even lead to changes in types of violence. However, most studies emphasize physical violence, while frequently neglecting women's experiences of sexual violence. We call for researchers in a variety of fields to continue their critical work into this pressing issue, with particular attention to broadening the type of violence addressed and to expanding the focus to the post-partum period, improving the racial/ethnic diversity of samples, increasing the number of longitudinal studies, and recognizing variations between developed and developing nations.

Patriarchy: The Predominant Discourse and Fount of Domestic Violence

Author: Bettman, Cathy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61372722?accountid=14925

Abstract: While supporting the need to make class and other forms of marginalisation more visible in the understanding of, and response to, domestic violence, this article argues that, domestic violence is ultimately a discursive phenomenon and that patriarchal discourse remains the fount of domestic violence. This conclusion was drawn after data from a qualitative study of 24 men, from different cultural groups (ethnic, religious, racial, age and class), who had used violence in an intimate heterosexual relationship was considered, alongside ethnographical accounts of societies in which domestic violence is deemed not to have occurred, or to have been minimal. Whereas egalitarian and respectful attitudes towards women are enshrined in the discourse and social institutions of tribes such as the Semai and Waorani, in which intimate partner violence was absent, the most overwhelming discovery of the qualitative study was that class and cultural differences, evident in an analysis of the men's narratives, seemed to be eclipsed by the preeminence and strength of gendered discourse, in keeping with Western patriarchal dictates.

In the Name of Love: Partner Abuse and Violence in Teenage Relationships

Author: Barter, Christine11 Christine Barter is an NSPCC Research Fellow with the School for Policy Studies, University of Bristol

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61347341?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article provides a critical assessment of our understanding of partner abuse and violence in teenage relationships. Initially, an overview is provided of theoretical and methodological issues in this area, examining how these dominant trends have influenced perceptions of this problem. In contrast, a more encompassing approach, incorporating gendered power relations, teenagers' own experiences and an acknowledgement of young people's agency, is suggested. Incidence rates for different forms of teenage partner abuse and violence are discussed. The importance of understanding the context in which such violence occurs, and the meaning it holds for young people, are highlighted. Young people's responses are explored and a range of risk factors associated with this form of violence evaluated. In conclusion, messages for policy and practice development are raised. Adapted from the source document.

Interview effects in the reporting of domestic violence

Author: Allen, W David

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60010801?accountid=14925

Abstract: Victims of domestic abuse sometimes have the opportunity to discuss their experiences in interviews with researchers and subsequently to report their victimization. Beyond the reporting decision -- a non-trivial information -- revelation decision -- they frequently must decide whether to have someone they know present at the interview and whether to conduct the interview in person or by telephone. Having an associate present at the interview may provide a respondent victim greater comfort or social support than she might have conducting the interview by herself, but perhaps only to the extent that the abusive partner does not pose a continuing household threat. Undertaking a personal interview may facilitate a greater degree of empathy or deeper understanding from the information gatherer likely unavailable over the telephone, but personal interviews generally take more time and incur more significant marginal opportunity costs. This paper examines conceptually and empirically how the parameters of these interviews, endogenously determined by victims themselves, affect the decision to report domestic violence.

Between the Professional and the Private: The Meaning of Working With Intimate Partner Violence in Social Workers' Private Lives

Author: Goldblatt, Hadass1; Buchbinder, Eli; Eisikovits, Zvi; Arizon-Mesinger, Ilana1 University of Haifa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61354342?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study examines the impact of working with intimate partner violence on therapists' marital relationships and gender identity. Data were collected by in-depth semistructured interviews with 14 experienced women social workers working in domestic violence treatment centers in Israel. Findings indicate that the boundaries between workers' private and professional lives are blurred and work experiences influence their intimate relationships and gender role identities, leading to overall questioning of their relationships. This newly rediscovered consciousness reshapes the meaning of workers' couple relationships. Such shift between private and professional should be considered when training workers to intervene with intimate partner violence. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright.]

Psychometric Properties Of The Spanish-Language Child Depression Inventory With Hispanic Children Who Are Secondary Victims Of Domestic Violence

Author: Molina, Carmen Soto1; Gomez, Jose Rodriguez; Pastrana, Maria C. Velez1 University of Puerto Rico, General Social Sciences Dept., Rio Piedras Campus, San Juan PR 00936

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61380094?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Child Depression Inventory (CDI), a self-report instrument that measures depressive symptomatology in children, has been shown to have adequate construct validity (Kovacs, 1983, 1992). However, limited research has been conducted with minority children and adolescents. In the present study, the construct validity of the Spanish-language version of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI-S) ages 8-12 years (N = 100). The CDI was developed by Maria Kovacs (1992) and has been a widely used instrument for screening depression in children. Fifty of the children had witnessed domestic violence (secondary victims of domestic violence) and received psychological services for victims of domestic violence, and fifty had not witnessed domestic violence. To identify the group of non-victims of domestic violence, their mothers completed the Conflict Tactic Scale (CIS). The CDI is a self-report instrument used to measure symptoms of depression. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed including the 27 items that make up the instrument, using principal component analysis as the extraction method and Varimax rotations. This analysis revealed that the CDI measures five dimensions of depression in the child. However, differences were found in the factor structure of the Spanish CDI when compared with the original version. Additionally, its internal consistency was documented. Adapted from the source document.

The Effect of Intimate Partner Violence on Receptive Syringe Sharing Among Young Female Injection Drug Users: An Analysis of Mediation Effects

Author: Wagner, Karla D1; Hudson, Sharon M; Latka, Mary H; Strathdee, Steffanie A; Thiede, Hanne; Mackesy-Amiti, Mary Ellen; Garfein, Richard S1 Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, 1000 S.

Abstract: This study sought to explore the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and receptive syringe sharing (RSS) among young female injection drug users (IDUs) and to examine mediating variables. Cross-sectional behavioral assessments were completed by 797 female IDUs in five U.S. cities who reported having at least one main sexual partner in the past three months. Linear regression was used to estimate direct and mediated effects. The product of coefficients method was used to statistically evaluate mediation. Respondents were predominantly white (70%) and mean age was 23 years. Sixty percent reported RSS in the past three months and 33% reported IPV in the past year. The association between IPV and RSS was independently mediated by self-esteem and depression, but not by self-efficacy for safer drug injection. Findings suggest that interventions focused on improving victimized women's self-esteem and depression may help mitigate some of the negative health effects of IPV.

Alcohol Use, Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual Coercion and HIV among Women Aged 15-24 in Rakai, Uganda

Author: Zablotska, Iryna B1; Gray, Ronald H; Koenig, Michael A; Serwadda, David; Nalugoda, Fred; Kigozi, Godfrey; Sewankambo, Nelson; Lutalo, Tom; Mangen, Fred Wabwire; Wawer, Maria1 National Centre in HIV Social Research, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia, i.zablotska@unsw.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/289836244?accountid=14925

Abstract: Disinhibition due to alcohol may induce intimate partner violence and sexual coercion and increased risk of HIV infection. In a sample of 3,422 women aged 15-24 from the Rakai cohort, Uganda, we examined the association between self-reported alcohol use before sex, physical violence/sexual coercion in the past and prevalent HIV, using adjusted odds ratios (Adj OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). During the previous year, physical violence (26.9%) and sexual coercion (13.4%) were common, and alcohol use before sex was associated with a higher risk of physical violence/sexual coercion. HIV prevalence was significantly higher with alcohol consumption before sex (Adj OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.06-1.98) and especially when women reported both prior sexual coercion and alcohol use before sex (Adj OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.25-2.56). Alcohol use before sex was associated with physical violence and sexual coercion, and both are jointly associated with HIV infection risk in young women.

Domestic Violence: Concrete Manifestations and Associated Factors

Author: Rodriguez, Francisco1; Cordova, Luis1 U Oriente, Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela franciscorodriguez50@cantv.net

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60384777?accountid=14925

Abstract: This is a field investigation of the descriptive & exploratory type that considered variable-aspects such as: socioeconomic level, communication & violence between the spouses. This investigation was carried out in a community of low socioeconomic level in Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela during the year 2006. A sample of 45 families was selected & the women were defined as units of information. High levels of verbal violence generated by both members of the couple were reported, as well as high levels of verbal interaction & low ones of physical violence. In this sense we can assume that the verbal abuse could be working in two ways -- at least for this study group -- as a substitute for physical violence or as the first step of a phenomenon that usually develops in stages. Adapted from the source document.

More Than Wife Abuse That Has Gone Old: A Conceptual Model for Violence against the Aged in Canada and the US

Author: Sev'er, Aysan11 Department of Sociology, University of Toronto, 1265 Military Trail, Scarborough, Ontario, MIC 1A4, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61770882?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence against the Aged (VAA) can take on the form of psychological, physical, sexual, economic abuse or neglect The under-reporting of VAA is a major problem, although both Canadian and USA studies show that the consequences of this crime are very serious. Moreover, although the rates may be stable (5-10%). the numbers are rising due to the aging of the Canadian and USA populations. In this paper, I introduce an integrated conceptual model for predicting VAA, which goes beyond intimate partner Violence. The model also suggests that struggles against VAA must simultaneously occur at the personal, social and structural dimensions. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence in the Second Half of Life

Author: Leisey, Monica1; Kupstas, Paula K; Cooper, Aly1 School of Social Work, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61357585?accountid=14925

Abstract: Providing an adequate and effective community response to women age 50 and older who experience domestic violence is complicated by the oftentimes disparate goals and expectations of service providers, emergency responders, and victims themselves. This article shares information provided by participants of focus groups designed to understand and identify what women age 50 and older want and need from agencies that provide services to enhance victim safety.

The Police Reporting Behavior of Intimate Partner Violence Victims

Author: Akers, Caroline1; Kaukinen, Catherine1 Institute of Criminology, Cambridge University, Sidgwick Avenue, Cambridge, CB3 9DT, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61436523?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the current research, we draw on Canadian national data to examine the police reporting decisions of married and cohabiting intimate partner violence victims. Our analyses examine how police notification decisions are influenced by the demographic characteristics of victims and incident-specific factors. We find that the victims who contact the police more often live in a cohabiting relationship and with children. In contrast to predictions, we find that visible minority women more often call the police. Income, education, and employment status do not appear to shape the police reporting decisions of women. Finally, women who call the police are also likely to have experienced severe forms of violence including threats with weapons, injury, and the destruction of their property.

The Incidence and Impact of Family Violence on Mental Health Among South Korean Women: Results of a National Survey

Author: Kim, Jaeyop1; Park, Sookyung; Emery, Clifton R1 Department of Social Welfare, Yonsei University, Shinchon-Dong, Seoul, South Korea, jaeyop@yonsei.ac.kr

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811325686?accountid=14925

Abstract: This representative national survey examined incidence of husband-to-wife violence in the past year, lifetime exposure to parental violence, and the relationships between victimization experiences of family violence and mental health among South Korean women (N=1,079). The major findings were that incidence rate of husband-to-wife violence among Korean women was 29.5%, which was much higher than those of other nations, and that their experiences of physical violence by husbands in the last year and lifetime verbal abuse by parents had strong associations with the mental health of victims. The findings suggest that preventive intervention programs for male perpetrators as well as domestic violence victims with mental health problems and comprehensive interventions for Korean couples are urgently needed. In addition, parents should be educated about how to modify their children's behavior without physical punishment or verbal abuse.

Programs for Men who Perpetrate Domestic Violence: An Examination of the Issues Underlying the Effectiveness of Intervention Programs

Author: Day, Andrew1; Chung, Donna; O'Leary, Patrick; Carson, Ed1 University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia andrew.day@unisa.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444210?accountid=14925

Abstract: This review paper seeks to explore some of the reasons why rehabilitation programs for male perpetrators of domestic violence appear to be less effective in reducing recidivism than programs for other offender groups. It is argued that while the model of systems response to domestic violence has predominated at the inter-agency level, further consideration might be given to way in which men's intervention groups are both designed and delivered. It is concluded that the program logic of men's domestic violence programs is rarely articulated leading to low levels of program integrity, and that one way to further improve program effectiveness is to incorporate some of the approaches evident in more general violence prevention programs and from what is know about good practice in general about offender rehabilitation.

Agreement on Intimate Partner Violence Among a Sample of Blue-Collar Couples

Author: Cunradi, Carol B1; Bersamin, Melina; Ames, Genevieve1 Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, cunradi@prev.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/813025560?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study assessed agreement level about the occurrence of past-year male-to-female partner violence (MFPV) and female-to-male partner violence (FMPV) among a sample of 897 blue-collar couples. Intimate partner violence (IPV) was measured with the Physical Assault subscale of the revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2). Agreement level was assessed with Cohen's kappa statistic. Lower-bound estimates (based on couple agreement that an IPV event occurred) and upper-bound estimates (based on uncorroborated reports from either partner that an IPV event occurred) were calculated. Results indicated low agreement for most IPV behaviors ( Kappa < .40). Estimated lower- and upper-bound rates for MFPV were 6.7% and 21.2%, for FMPV, 7.1% and 24.2%, and for any IPV, 10.1% and 30.2%. Findings suggest that single-point IPV prevalence estimates are biased; lower- and upper-bound estimates using collateral reports should be calculated when possible. In addition, findings underscore the importance of conducting IPV research among understudied populations, such as working-class couples, that may be at elevated IPV risk.

Development and Preliminary Psychometric Evaluation of the Domestic Violence-Related Financial Issues Scale (DV-FI)

Author: Weaver, Terri L1; Sanders, Cynthia K; Campbell, Carole L; Schnabel, Meg1 Saint Louis University weavert@slu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382492?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) occurs at disproportionate rates within impoverished groups of women and can include economic abuse as a form of psychological maltreatment. The current study developed a comprehensive assessment of the unique financial issues facing female victims of IPV using a sheltered sample (N = 113). An exploratory factor analysis (principal-axis factoring with varimax rotation) was conducted on 24 items of the newly developed Domestic Violence-Related Financial Issues Scale. Preliminary results supported five extracted factors, which accounted for approximately 53% of the total common variance in the women's responses. Psychometric properties of the instrument are presented. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Researching Domestic Violence in Same-Sex Relationships -- A Feminist Epistemological Approach to Survey Development

Author: Hester, Marianne1; Donovan, Catherine1 University of Bristol, School for Policy Studies, 8 Priory Road, Bristol, BS8 1TZ, United Kingdom marianne.hester@bristol.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61759200?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article draws on recently completed research by the authors, involving a detailed study of love and intimate partner violence in same-sex and heterosexual relationships (funded by the ESRC, award RES-000-23-0650). The research, hitherto the most detailed study of its kind in the United Kingdom, included a national same-sex community survey (n = 800) plus four focus groups and interviews with 67 individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, queer, bisexual, transgender, or heterosexual. The article discusses in particular the development of the same-sex community survey, focusing on the epistemological and methodological implications of using a feminist approach. Adapted from the source document.

Constructions of local culture and impacts on domestic violence in an Australian rural community

Author: Wendt, Sarah

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61768306?accountid=14925

Abstract: Studies of domestic violence in rural areas have predominantly focused on barriers that keep women trapped in abusive relationships. The literature has frequently suggested that rural culture influences the incidence of domestic violence, the forms it takes, and how it is experienced. Yet there is surprisingly little research on how rural culture plays out in relationships between women and men who experience domestic violence. The study described in this paper explored local culture in a South Australian rural community and how it affected women's experiences of, and men's perpetration of, domestic violence. It found several local cultural discourses that bore on the issue, including self-reliance, pride, privacy, belonging and closeness, family, and Christianity. The power and influence of these discourses made it difficult to name and challenge domestic violence. The paper concludes with the argument that it is important to acknowledge and understand the values and beliefs of rural women and men when developing effective and appropriate responses to rural domestic violence. There is a need to move away from universal understandings of a rural culture to acknowledge discourses that have power and strength within a community so that we can sensitively challenge discourses that silence domestic violence.

Relationship Violence and Frequency of Intoxication Among Low-Income Urban Women

Author: Hill, Terrence D1; Nielsen, Amie L; Angel, Ronald J1 Department of Sociology, University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61439997?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using data from the Welfare, Children, and Families project (1999), a probability sample of 2,280 low-income women with children living in low-income neighborhoods in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio, we examine the effects of relationship violence before age 18 and in the past year on frequency of adult intoxication. Results obtained from a series of ordered logistic regression models suggest that sexual coercion before age 18 and minor and severe physical assault in the past year are independently associated with greater frequency of intoxication, net of a range of sociodemographic controls. The study's limitations are noted. Adapted from the source document.

A Descriptive Analysis of Transitional Housing Programs for Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence in the United States

Author: Baker, Charlene K1; Niolon, Phyllis Holditch; Oliphant, Hilary1 University of Hawaii at Manoa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61776044?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 2005 focuses on safe and independent housing for survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV). The focus on housing in the latest version of VAWA suggests recognition by Congress that removing barriers and increasing access to safe housing is critical to our nation's response to IPV, and that this type of systems-level response is necessary to reduce the link between IPV and subsequent homelessness. This study examines the current state of transitional housing programs (THPs) and discusses future program considerations, including the need for evaluation studies that consider the possible impact that transitional housing programs have on the rates of violence toward women and their children, and on women's ability to achieve economic stability after separating from their abusive partners.

Intimate Partner Violence Against Athabaskan Women Residing in Interior Alaska: Results of a Victimization Survey

Author: Wood, Darryl S1; Magen, Randy H1 Washington State University Vancouver

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61778074?accountid=14925

Abstract: A survey instrument mirroring the National Violence Against Women Survey was administered in person to measure the incidence and prevalence of intimate partner violence against Athabaskan women residing in the interior of Alaska. Roughly two thirds of respondents (63.7%) reported an intimate partner assault victimization at some point in their adult lifetime, and 18% of the respondents reported that they had been physically assaulted by an intimate partner in the year preceding the survey. Findings revealed that intimate partner assault victimization is more prevalent and is considerably more frequent when compared to that reported for American women in general.

Collaboration between child welfare agencies and domestic violence service providers: Relationship with child welfare policies and practices for addressing domestic violence

Author: Banks, D1; Hazen, AL; Coben, J H; Wang, K; Griffith, J D1 2283 Dunster Lane, Potomoc, MD 20854, United States, durenbanks@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811404337?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this paper was to examine collaborative activities occurring between child welfare agencies and domestic violence service providers and to investigate whether there was a relationship between collaborative efforts and domestic violence policy and practice in child welfare agencies. Data were derived from the Children and Domestic Violence Services study, which obtained cross-sectional data from a large sample of child welfare agencies across the United States, and from the Greenbook evaluation, which conducted a longitudinal case study investigation of a federal initiative that provided support to several communities to establish collaborative mechanisms aimed at improving the effectiveness of child welfare policy related to domestic violence. Findings from the cross-sectional data revealed that in almost three-quarters of the communities, formal collaborative activities existed between child welfare and domestic violence agencies. However, the data did not demonstrate a relationship between these activities and child welfare policy and practice related to domestic violence. Longitudinal case study findings from the Greenbook evaluation did reveal some changes in child welfare policy and practice in association with the implementation of activities that increased collaboration between child welfare and domestic violence service providers. Improvements were found in child welfare agency screening and assessment, advocacy for adult domestic violence victims, and multidisciplinary approaches to case planning. The extent to which changes were observed varied across the sites, however, and appeared to be related to the specific planning approach undertaken in each community. Additional work is needed to identify optimal collaborative strategies to enhance domestic violence policy and practice and improve outcomes for families.

Partnering With Community-Based Organizations to Reduce Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Bloom, Tina1; Wagman, Jennifer; Hernandez, Rebecca; Yragui, Nan; Hernandez-Valdovinos, Noelia; Dahlstrom, Marie; Glass, Nancy1 University of Missouri, Columbia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61760907?accountid=14925

Abstract: Latinas experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) often avoid formal resources due to fear, distrust, and cultural and language barriers, yet little research addresses culturally appropriate interventions for abused Latinas. To develop effective interventions, we must include abused Latinas' voices in research and collaborate with the community-based organizations (CBOs) that serve them. This article's team of academics and CBOs used a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to inform development of a culturally and linguistically appropriate IPV intervention for Latinas. The authors were able to reach abused Latinas (n = 114) with a relatively low mean acculturation level in a state that is only 8% Latino. The authors share six recommendations from their successful experience to engage, enhance, and sustain research partnerships with CBOs, including strategies to share power and knowledge, and demonstrate accountability to the partnership and the community.

The 2005 Riots in France: The International Impact of Domestic Violence

Author: Koff, Harlan; Duprez, Dominique

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61742834?accountid=14925

Abstract: Following the Autumn 2005 riots in France, many observers in both the popular and the academic press argued that the urban violence that occurred over a two-week period was an open challenge to the French Republican model of citizenship, which does not recognise racial, ethnic or religious affiliations. Many experts focused their analyses of the riots on the relationship between discrimination and ethnic mobilisation in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Often, the discussions surrounding the uprisings were embedded in the ongoing debate between liberal and communitarian notions of citizenship and the lack of ethnic recognition in France. The articles in this special issue of JEMS indicate another interpretation of the events of October-November 2005. According to much of the comparative analysis presented in this collection, the riots were not a challenge to the French Republic but a demonstration of its schizophrenic characteristics. Adapted from the source document.

Investigating the Relationship Between Intimate Partner Violence and HIV Risk-Propensity in Black/African-American Women

Author: Josephs, Lauren L1; Abel, Eileen Mazur1 Center for Health Futures at Florida Hospital, 200 N Lakemont Ave, Winter Park, FL 32792, USA lauren.josephs@flhosp.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61349522?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explored the relationship between Intimate Partner Violence and HIV Risk-Propensity in African-American women. An anonymous questionnaire was completed by a community based sample of 200 African American women with a varied history of intimate partner violence, to determine whether being in a violent relationship impacts HIV risk. Various statistical techniques, including structural equation modeling (SEM), bivariate correlation analyses and ANOVA were used to examine the data. A strong positive correlation was found to exist between sexual coercion and Intimate Partner Violence. In the effort to fortify prevention strategies, and reduce the rates of HIV infection in African-American women, additional factors that impact disease transmission were discussed. Implications for social work/mental health practice and suggestions for future research were made. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This article reports a study of the possible impact of sociodemographic and interactional aspects of intimate partner violence (IPV) on help-seeking behavior. Do different sociodemographic groups of IPV survivors use different professional supports and treatments? Do different professional support and treatment agencies come predominantly in contact with women who have been subjected to different characteristics of IPV? Do different interactional IPV variables predict whether IPV victims contact the police, a family doctor, or a psychologist or psychiatrist? A representative sample of 157 women recruited from family counseling, the police, and shelters in Norway was interviewed. Three of seven sociodemographic variables showed statistically significant differences among the recruitment groups. No significant differences in characteristics of IPV were found among the recruitment groups. However, there were significant differences between the main categories (physical, psychological, and sexual) of IPV and interactional IPV factors concerning help-seeking. Our findings indicate that the help-seeking of IPV survivors is differentiated and interaction-specific and that they respond adequately to the different interactional consequences of IPV.

Assessing the Domestic Violence Training Needs of Benefits Workers

Author: Payne, Brian K1; Triplett, Ruth1 Department of Criminal Justice, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA bpayne@gsu.edu

Abstract: Domestic violence victims often have economic and employment needs that either directly or indirectly stem from their victimization. In their efforts to seek services, victims may turn to benefits workers who are given the task of providing clients with short-term financial help, job training, access to health care, and assistance in obtaining a job. It is not clear whether benefits workers are adequately prepared to help domestic violence victims. In this study, 189 social services workers from the Commonwealth of Virginia were surveyed to assess the training needs of all social services workers. This article focuses on the specific training needs of benefits workers and draws comparisons between benefits workers' training needs and other workers' needs. The findings suggest that benefits workers are perceived as knowing less about domestic violence than other social services workers. Implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

No One Type of Intimate Partner Abuse: Exploring Physical and Non-physical Abuse Among Intimate Partners

Author: Outlaw, Maureen11 Department of Sociology, Howley Hall, Providence College, 1 Cunningham Square, Providence, RINB02918, USA moutlaw@providence.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61767516?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although research into intimate partner abuse has expanded throughout the past several decades and increased our understanding of this multi-faceted phenomenon, the vast majority of empirical work is still focused almost exclusively on physical violence-against women in particular. Although a crucial issue in our society, physical violence against women is only one facet in an array of possible abusive behaviors toward an intimate partner. Researchers have long acknowledged the existence of multiple forms of non-physical abuse. These types of abuse have received little research attention, however, and are commonly lumped together simply as "non-physical" or "emotional" abuse. There is no reason to believe, however, that all forms of non-physical abuse are the same, whether in intensity, frequency, or co-existence with physical violence. The current study attempts to disentangle the multiple types of nonviolent abuse to examine prevalence, differences by sex, and its relationships to physical abuse. Using Tjaden and Thoennes' (1998) survey data, this study examines the prevalence of different types of non-physical abuse, both in the general population and among those experiencing physical violence Findings indicate that non-physical partner abuse is more common than physical and that non-physical abuse does not show striking sex differences, as is commonly believed. There is strong evidence that some types of non-physical abuse serve as clear risk factors for physical abuse and may increase risk of more frequent violence among those already being abused. These relationships do not, however, differ by sex. Implications for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Seeking for Risk Factors of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in a Greek National Sample: The Role of Self-Esteem

Author: Papadakaki, Maria1; Tzamalouka, Georgia S; Chatzifotiou, Sevasti; Chliaoutakis, Joannes1 Technological Educational Institute of Crete

Abstract: The objective of this article is to gain a better understanding of the magnitude of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Greece and to explore factors associated with increased risk of IPV prevalence. A cross-sectional study was undertaken among 1,122 men and women, aged 18 to 65, who are residents of urban areas of Greece. The questionnaire used included 3 sections and 39 items that examined the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, rate of IPV victimization and perpetration (physical, sexual, emotional), childhood experience of violence, and level of self-esteem. Statistical analysis showed self-esteem to be significantly associated with physical violence victimization and perpetration (odds ratio [OR] = .975, confidence interval [CI] = .955--.996; OR = .972, CI = .951--.993, respectively), whereas experience of abuse during childhood was shown to be a strong predictor in all six models of IPV victimization and perpetration (p < .001). Finally, gender, age and years of cohabitation were some sociodemographic and background characteristics found to increase the risk of specific forms of IPV. Conclusions drawn from the current study should be taken into account in attempts aiming at preventing or ameliorating the problem.

Health and Occupational Consequences of Spouse Abuse Victimization Among Male U.S. Army Soldiers

Author: Bell, Nicole S11 Social Sectors Development Strategies, Inc

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61768021?accountid=14925

Abstract: Little is known about health and occupational outcomes of male spouse abuse victims. In all, 11,294 male spouse abuse victims with a history of spouse abuse perpetration, 3,277 victims without prior spouse abuse perpetration, and 72,855 nonvictims and nonperpetrators were followed for 12 years to assess army attrition and hospitalization risk. In multivariate Cox models controlling for age, race, education, rank, service time, and dependents, victims were at significantly greater risk for early army discharge and hospitalization than were nonvictims-- particularly hospitalizations for depression, alcohol dependence, and mental health--even when the hospitalization occurred years after the abuse event. Victim--perpetrators had greater risk than did victim--nonperpetrators for both attrition (1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.18; 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02-1.08, respectively) and hospitalizations (1.45, 95% CI = 1.38-1.52; 1.38, 95% CI = 1.27-1.49, respectively). College education was protective and deserves further inquiry. Male victims need greater support following spouse abuse. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Views of Intimate Partner Violence in Same- and Opposite-Sex Relationships

Author: Sorenson, Susan B1; Thomas, Kristie A1 1University of Pennsylvania

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/289880912?accountid=14925

Abstract: Attitudes toward same-sex intimate relationships and intimate partner violence (IPV) are changing. Little research, however, has examined norms about IPV in same-sex relationships. Using a fractional factorial (experimental vignette) design, we conducted random-digit-dialed interviews in four languages with 3,679 community-residing adults. Multivariate analyses of responses to 14,734 vignettes suggest that IPV against gay male, lesbian, and heterosexual women is more likely than that against heterosexual men to be considered illegal and that it should be illegal, police called, and a stay-away order issued. Regardless of gender and sexual orientation, the type of abuse and whether a weapon was displayed are the strongest predictors of respondents' judgments about whether a behavior is illegal and merits a range of societal interventions.

The independent contribution of individual-, neighbourhood-, and country-level socioeconomic position on attitudes towards intimate partner violence against women in sub-Saharan Africa: A multilevel model of direct and moderating effects

Author: Uthman, Olalekan Abdulrahman1; Moradi, Tahereh; Lawoko, Stephen1 Department of Public Health Sciences, Division of Social Medicine, Epidemiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden olalekan.uthman@ki.se

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61420690?accountid=14925

Abstract: We examined associations between country, neighbourhood, and individual socioeconomic position (SEP) and attitudes towards intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW). We applied multivariable multilevel logistic regression analysis on Demographic and Health Survey data for 165,983 women and 68,501 men nested within 7465 communities from 17 countries in sub-Saharan Africa collected between 2003 and 2007. Contrary to expectation women were 34% more likely to justify IPVAW than men. We found that sex moderates associations of individual-, neighbourhood-, and country-level SEP with attitudes towards IPVAW. There was a significant positive interaction effect between sex and education attainment; women with no education were more likely to justify IPVAW than men with no education. Negative sex interaction with household wealth status indicates that differences in attitude are less pronounced among women. Unemployed men were more likely to justify IPVAW. Interaction effects indicate that the association of neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage with attitudes was more pronounced among women than among men. The association of country-level SEP with attitudes towards IPVWA was inconclusive. There was some evidence that neighbourhood modified the association between individual SEP and attitudes towards IPV. Also, there was cross-level interaction between country and neighbourhood SEP. Neighbourhood and individual SEP were independently associated with attitudes towards IPVAW. The relationship with country-level SEP was inconclusive. The findings underscore the need to implement public health prevention/intervention strategies not only at the level of individual SEP but also at the neighbourhood level. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

'What's the Problem?': Australian Public Policy Constructions of Domestic and Family Violence

Author: Murray, Suellen1; Powell, Anastasia1 RMIT University

Abstract: The campaign of feminists to have domestic violence formally acknowledged as a key issue affecting Australian women succeeded in the early 1980s when governments began developing policy seeking to address the problem. Far from simply adopting feminist gendered understandings of domestic violence, however, the development of contemporary policy responses to this issue has been influenced by a number of competing discourses about the problem, its causes, and possible solutions. Drawing on Bacchi's policy analysis approach, the authors compare the discursive constructions of domestic violence inherent in how the issue is named, framed, and defined across contemporary Australian policy documents.

Domestic violence network in China: Translating the transnational concept of violence against women into local action

Author: Zhang, Lu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61735779?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic Violence Network (DVN) is a Chinese women's NGO that has emerged in response to the transnational women's human rights movement against violence against women. This article discusses & analyzes the socio-political processes of DVN's "translation" of the transnational issue frame of "violence against women" in its local programs. It reviews DVN's gender & human rights advocacy across three of its major areas of activism research, gender training & legal advocacy. Moreover, it examines how DVN collaborates with state agencies, especially the governmental women's organization, to transform its advocacy into policy action. In particular, the article raises questions about the potential costs of this "politics of engagement," arguing that this relationship with the state may dilute DVN's gender & human rights advocacy as well as curb its political autonomy in future activism.

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Domestic Violence Survivors' Experiences with Their Informal Social Networks

Author: Trotter, Jennifer L1; Allen, Nicole E1 Dept Psychology, U Illinois Urbana-Champaign

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59974326?accountid=14925

Abstract: Informal social networks play a critical role in buffering the negative effects of stressful life events. For women experiencing the stress of a violent relationship, family and friends are among the first sources of support sought; however, reactions to the abuse by family and friends are not uniformly perceived as helpful by survivors. The current study takes a qualitative approach to examining the range of possible reactions survivors may encounter from their social networks regarding the abuse. Special attention is given to negative and mixed reactions, as they have previously been under-examined in the literature. Findings suggest that survivors (N = 45) regularly experience negative and mixed reactions. Emergent themes suggest that both positive and negative reactions to abuse could be understood in four broad arenas: safety, emotional availability, input, and aid. However, positive and negative reactions emerged as distinct constructs within each arena; mixed reactions took multiple forms including being within person and within network.

Adolescent Male and Female Gang Members' Experiences with Violent Victimization, Dating Violence, and Sexual Assault

Author: Gover, Angela R1; Jennings, Wesley G; Tewksbury, Richard1 School of Public Affairs, University of Colorado Denver, 1380 Lawrence Street, Suite 525, Denver, CO 80217-3364, USA angela.gover@cudenver.edu

Abstract: A substantial amount of scholarship has been devoted to examining the relationship between gang membership and criminal offending. This research has produced a wealth of qualitative and quantitative studies indicating that gang membership increases the likelihood of criminal offending for both males and females. Less research, however, has examined the relationship between gang membership and violent victimization. The present study adds to the literature by examining the relationship between gender, gang membership, and three types of victimization. Specifically, this paper focuses on whether self-reported gang membership is uniquely related to victimization experiences for females compared to males. Results from a statewide survey of public high school students in South Carolina indicate that gang membership is significantly related to the risk of victimization for both males and females. The implications of these findings for research and policy are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

East Timorese Women Challenge Domestic Violence

Author: Hall, Nina11 United Nations Secretariat, New Yor fo the Department Political Affairs

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61779164?accountid=14925

Abstract: Timor-Leste's struggle for independence has won it high international profile. Yet there is little known internationally about the role women played in the resistance movement & how independence has affected them. Has democratisation brought women greater freedom & rights? This article argues that some East Timorese women benefited from the construction of a new democratic state by mobilising & unifying in the political space created post-1999. East Timorese women's NGOs allied with international organisations & NGOs to form a campaign against domestic violence. This article takes a constructivist approach, analysing how international norms of women's rights & gender eequality have: (1) emerged, (2) reached a tipping point, (3) cascaded & (4) been internalised in a post-conflict, democratising context. Adapted from the source document.

Demographic and Social Predictors of Intimate Partner Violence in Columbia: A Dyadic Power Perspective

Author: Jones, James Holland1; Fergusen, Brodie1 Dept Anthropology, Stanford U, CA e-mail:jhj1@stanford.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60333074?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major health and human rights problem globally. However, empirical findings on the predictors of IPV cross-culturally are highly inconsistent, and the theory of IPV is underdeveloped. We propose a new analytical framework based on cooperative game theory in which IPV is a function of the power relations of the dyadic relationship, not simply the actors involved. Using data from the 2005 Colombian Demographic and Health Survey, we test the hypothesis that IPV is predicted by large asymmetries in dyadic power using a hierarchical generalized linear model. Results suggest that education, urban residence, age at sexual debut, whether the woman has other sexual partners, and the age difference between spouses have strong effects on the log-odds of a woman experiencing IPV. Cooperative game theory and social network analysis offer a general approach to the problem of intimate partner interactions which can be applied broadly cross-culturally. Adapted from the source document.

Shelter Service Utilization of Domestic Violence Victims

Author: Clevenger, Brady J Miller1; Roe-Sepowitz, Dominique1 School of Social Work, Arizona State University, Phoenix, Arizona

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61764614?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines service utilization among 283 adult victims of domestic violence identified by crisis responders as being in need of crisis services. The purpose of this study is to explore the differences between the domestic violence victims who choose to utilize shelter services and those who do not. Findings suggest that domestic violence victims who were more likely to utilize shelter services included those who had children at the time of the incident, victims who called for assistance from a location other than their home, victims who did not have a current order of protection in place, and victims who were injured during the domestic violence incident. Implications suggest more specific services to be provided by shelters. Adapted from the source document.

Is Animal Cruelty a 'Red Flag' for Family Violence? Investigating Co-Occurring Violence Toward Children, Partners, and Pets

Author: DeGue, Sarah1; DiLillo, David1 John Jay College of Criminal Justice, sdegue@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811209011?accountid=14925

Abstract: Cross-reporting legislation, which permits child and animal welfare investigators to refer families with substantiated child maltreatment or animal cruelty for investigation by parallel agencies, has recently been adopted in several U.S. jurisdictions. The current study sheds light on the underlying assumption of these policies-that animal cruelty and family violence commonly co-occur. Exposure to family violence and animal cruelty is retrospectively assessed using a sample of 860 college students. Results suggest that animal abuse may be a red flag indicative of family violence in the home. Specifically, about 60% of participants who have witnessed or perpetrated animal cruelty as a child also report experiences with child maltreatment or domestic violence. Differential patterns of association were revealed between childhood victimization experiences and the type of animal cruelty exposure reported. This study extends current knowledge of the links between animal- and human-directed violence and provides initial support for the premise of cross-reporting legislation.

Participation in Prevention Programs for Dating Violence: Beliefs about Relationship Violence and Intention to Participate

Author: Cornelius, Tara L1; Sullivan, Kieran T; Wyngarden, Nicole; Milliken, Jennifer C1 Grand Valley State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61781238?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study utilizes the Health Belief Model (HBM) to examine the factors related to the intention to participate in prevention programming for dating violence. Perceptions of susceptibility to future violence and the benefits of prevention programming appear to be the strongest predictors of participation in prevention programs. Perceptions of the severity of dating violence do not appear to be related to intentions to participate. There were no differences in intention between those reporting psychological or physical violence in their dating relationship, although some of the HBM factors were associated with a history of violence. Contrary to hypotheses, psychological and physical violence did not moderate the impact of the HBM factors on intention.

Family and school socioeconomic disadvantage: Interactive influences on adolescent dating violence victimization

Author: Spriggs, Aubrey L; Halpern, Carolyn Tucker; Herring, Amy H; Schoenbach, Victor J

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61415482?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although low socioeconomic status has been positively associated with adult partner violence, its relationship to adolescent dating violence remains unclear. Further, few studies have examined the relationship between contextual disadvantage and adolescent dating violence, or the interactive influences of family and contextual disadvantage. Guided by social disorganization theory, relative deprivation theory, and gendered resource theory, we analyzed data from the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1994-1996) to explore how family and school disadvantage relate to dating violence victimization. Psychological and minor physical victimization were self-reported by adolescents in up to six heterosexual romantic or sexual relationships. Family and school disadvantage were based on a principal component analysis of soecioeconomic indicators reported by adolescents and parents. In weighted multilevel random effects models, between-school variability in dating violence victimization was proportionately small but substantive: 10% for male victimization and 5% for female victimization. In bivariate analyses, family disadvantage was positively related to victimization for both males and females; however, school disadvantage was only related to males' physical victimization. In models adjusted for race/ethnicity, relative age within the school, and mean school age, neither family nor school disadvantage remained related to males' victimization. For females, family disadvantage remained significantly positively associated with victimization, but was modified by school disadvantage: family disadvantage was more strongly associated with dating violence victimization in more advantaged schools. Findings support gendered resource theory, and suggest that status differentials between females and their school context may increase their vulnerability to dating violence victimization.

Still a Movement After All These Years? Current Tensions in the Domestic Violence Movement

Author: Lehrner, Amy1; Allen, Nicole E1 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61791829?accountid=14925

Abstract: The domestic violence movement began as a social change movement with dual goals of social change and service provision. Despite concerns about a devolution of the movement into apolitical service provision, few studies have investigated the current status of the movement as a social change movement. Through interviews with advocates, the current study explores the degree to which domestic violence work can still be characterized as a social change movement, illuminates some central tensions within the movement, and lays a foundation for debate among those responding to domestic violence. This research also highlights movement leaders' visions for a reenergized movement. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2009.]

E-mail Use Among a Sample of Intimate Partner Violence Shelter Residents

Author: Rothman, Emily F1; Meade, Jennifer; Decker, Michele R1 Boston University School of Public Health

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/813006572?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although it is estimated that approximately 75% of U.S. adults have e-mail access, the proportion of battered women's shelter residents who use e-mail is currently unknown. Remaining in contact with residents following shelter stays is challenging. E-mail might hold promise for follow-up contact if a sufficient number of survivors use e-mail and safety concerns can be addressed. Among a convenience sample of residents of 11 Massachusetts shelters (N = 57), the authors find that 47% had a current e-mail account. Among those with e-mail accounts, 89% used e-mail in locations other than their own homes; 81% reported that, to their knowledge, their e-mail accounts had never been accessed by unauthorized dating partners; and 88% reported that they thought it would be safe for the shelter to e-mail them following their departure. Additional research assessing the feasibility (i.e., safety, acceptability, and cost benefit) of remaining in contact with shelter residents via the Internet would be beneficial.

Domestic violence and child custody: Are family court professionals' decisions based on erroneous beliefs?

Author: Hamel, John; Desmarais, Sarah L; Nicholls, Tonia L; Malley-Morrison, Kathleen; Aaronson, Jon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862597433?accountid=14925

Abstract: If child custody decisions are based on erroneous beliefs, family courts may not be acting in the best interests of children. This study examined family court professionals' beliefs about family violence. Respondents (N = 410) of diverse professions, including child custody mediators, evaluators, and therapists, family law attorneys and judges, victim advocates and university students, completed a 10-item multiple-choice quiz. Results revealed low rates of correct responding, with respondents correctly answering approximately three out of 10 items on average, based on current research in the field. Overall, response rates were highly consistent with the discredited patriarchal paradigm. Shelter workers and victim advocates had the lowest average score, and men were found to have slightly higher scores than women. More troubling, students' scores were not significantly lower than those of family court professionals. Implications are discussed with respect to decision-making in the context of child custody disputes. Adapted from the source document.

Validation of a Measure of Intimate Partner Abuse with Couples Participating in Divorce Mediation

Author: Beck, Connie J A1; Menke, J Michael; Brewster, Karey O'Hara; Figueredo, Aurelio Jose1 Department of Psychology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61751917?accountid=14925

Abstract: Critics of court mandated divorce mediation have raised awareness of the need for screening measures to assess intimate partner abuse. This study validates a new instrument that is a revised version of the Partner Abuse Scales developed by Walter Hudson in the 1990s. The Relationship Behavior Rating Scale (RBRS) correlates highly with the original scales and subscales developed from the original and RBRS items have equally high reliability. The new scale is a reliable measure for intimate partner abuse in divorce mediation. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence Service Users: A Comparison of Older and Younger Women Victims

Author: Lundy, Marta1; Grossman, Susan F1 Loyola University Chicago, School of Social Work, 820 N. Michigan Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA mlundy@luc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60011025?accountid=14925

Abstract: No one, young or old, is immune to interpersonal violence (IPV). Female victims come from a variety of circumstances and across all ages. However, much of the research and services have focused almost exclusively on younger women. This article compares women 65 and older to women under 65, who utilized domestic violence (DV) services in a mid-western state over a five-year period. Although there are many similarities in the findings, differences include that older victims were more likely to be White, report more emotional and less physical abuse, be referred to services by a legal source, have special needs or disabilities, and receive fewer services, less service hours and fewer contacts than younger victims utilizing DV services. Implications for research and practice are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

A Comparison of Civil and Criminal Orders of Protection as Remedies for Domestic Violence Victims in a Midwestern County

Author: Kethineni, Sesha1; Beichner, Dawn1 Criminal Justice Sciences Department, Illinois State University, Campus Box 5250, Normal, IL, 61790-5250, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61379899?accountid=14925

Abstract: Past research has identified many potential advantages of civil protection orders as a means of addressing domestic violence without invoking an official response of the criminal justice system. Using data from a Midwestern county, this exploratory study provides a comparison of civil protection orders with orders of protection that are filed in conjunction with a criminal battering arrest. We examine the demographic characteristics of the respondents/defendants and petitioners/victims, the nature of the abuse leading up to the filing of the protection order, the reasons for filing, the terms of the order, location of the offense, and violations of orders. Our findings reveal many similarities between types of orders, in terms of order stipulations, past abuse histories of petitioners/victims, and respondents/defendants' likelihood of reoffending. The findings also reveal an important difference in the petitioners' and victims' reasons for filing; whereas petitioners in civil cases were more likely to identify emotional abuse as the factor leading up to issuance of the order, victims in criminal cases were more likely to document physical abuse. We discuss these findings in the context of victim preference. Adapted from the source document.

Autonomy, Dependence or Culture: Examining the Impact of Resources and Socio-cultural Processes on Attitudes Towards Intimate Partner Violence in Ghana, Africa

Abstract: Despite the high levels of domestic violence (intimate partner violence) against African women, tests of competing theories on why the practice is common in the region are quite limited. This study evaluates the effects of resources and cultural factors on attitudes Africans hold about the acceptability of gendered violence, and specifically wife beating (battering). Answers to these questions are relevant to the discourse on intimate partner violence, at least, as pertains to male-dominated societies such as those found in Africa. Drawing on national data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, we explore these linkages in an African context. Our findings suggest that egalitarian decision-making and equal household contributions are associated with a reduced acceptance of abusive actions toward women. We suggest that new questions must be asked concerning the present and future role of men and women within households and the community. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Objectives To identify whether individual and household economic empowerment is associated with lower intimate partner violence in low and middle income country settings. Methods Systematic PubMed and internet searches. Results Published data from 41 sites were reviewed. Household assets and women's higher education were generally protective. Evidence about women's involvement in income generation and experience of past year violence was mixed, with five finding a protective association and six documenting a risk association. Conclusion At an individual and household level, economic development and poverty reduction may have protective impacts on IPV. Context specific factors influence whether financial autonomy is protective or associated with increased risk. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

Partner and Relationship Factors in Domestic Violence

Author: Pandey, G K1; Dutt, Debashis; Banerjee, Bratati1 Central Health Service

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61752080?accountid=14925

Abstract: A cross-sectional study in a representative sample of 751 women, living in slums, examined their perspectives on partner and relationship factors of domestic violence. More than 17% of women experienced physical violence in the past year. Individual factors related to the husband--namely, poor socioeconomic status, use of alcohol, extramarital relations, and visiting red light districts--increased the risk of violence. The following relationship factors were associated with a higher risk of violence: age difference of 5 years or less between spouses, husband's irregular contribution to family expenses, not sharing information about his personal expenses, manifestation of controlling behaviors, and longer duration of marriage. The study concludes that adverse socioeconomic conditions create low self-esteem and insecurity among men, who find expression in aberrant behaviors, and violence is used as a compensatory behavior. Interventions, therefore, need to go beyond the victim-centric approach and address partner and relationship issues for greater impact.

Court Compliance as a Predictor of Postadjudication Recidivism for Domestic Violence Offenders

Author: Kindness, Alana1; Kim, Han; Alder, Stephen; Edwards, Alison; Parekh, Asha; Olson, Lenora M1 University of Utah

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61416742?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study evaluated pre- and postadjudication behavior of 220 male defendants convicted of a domestic violence-related offense using court records and police department data. Our goal was the identification of possible predictors for continued criminal behavior that could pose a risk of further harm to victims. Factors identified as significant predictors of defendant recidivism were having two or more court reports of noncompliance with domestic violence treatment, two or more warrants issued by the court for noncompliance, and two or more reports to law enforcement of new criminal activity involving the defendant. Law enforcement reports were the strongest predictor of recidivism, with an odds ratio of 7.7 and confidence interval of 3.0-19.7. These results illustrate the importance of monitoring multiple dimensions of defendant behavior while under court supervision and of communicating information on noncompliance with victims and advocates to assist in safety planning efforts.

Korean Older Intimate Partner Violence Survivors in North America: Cultural Considerations and Practice Recommendations

Author: Shim, Woochan S1; Nelson-Becker, Holly1 Daejeon University, Daejeon, South Korea

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61750623?accountid=14925

Abstract: While literature on elder abuse has expanded, elder abuse by intimate partners has been less investigated. Even less is known about intimate partner violence among older Koreans living in North America. This article identifies important cultural considerations for individuals helping the Korean older adult community, beginning with the definition of intimate partner violence in this community and barriers to leaving that include traditional views of the East Asian self. Current practice interventions are discussed and recommendations for future practice such as healing han, the accumulated suffering from years of abuse, are suggested. The ultimate goal of this paper is to expand awareness in order to develop the best culturally competent prevention and intervention practice for Korean older intimate partner violence survivors in North America. Adapted from the source document.

Using Prompts to Increase Attendance at Groups for Survivors of Domestic Violence

Author: Martinez, Katherine K1; Wong, Stephen E1 Florida International University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61455444?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objectives: This study investigated the effects of multiple prompts, telephone calls, and written reminders on attendance at group support meetings in a long-term residential facility for survivors of domestic violence. Methods: Participants were 15 Hispanic women who were residing in the facility at the time of the study. Prompts to attend the support meetings were introduced, removed, and reintroduced within an ABAB single-system design. Results: Data from sign-in sheets showed that prompting procedures at least doubled attendance at the support meetings. Conclusions: Possible factors contributing to the effectiveness of social workers using prompts to promote attendance at group support meetings are briefly discussed.

Does Type of Crime Affect the Stress and Coping Process? Implications of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Green, Diane L1; Kane, Michael N1 School of Social Work, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741611423?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence occurs in relationships of intimacy, kinship, dependency, or trust. It ranges from physical, emotional, financial, and sexual abuse to neglect. A relatively unexplored area has been the study of the type of crime as a factor affecting stress and coping in victims. A small but compelling body of literature suggests that such stressors as crime victimization may be coped with quite differently by subgroups of victims. As such, this study explores the differences in appraisal, coping strategy, levels of distress, social support, and well-being in a sample of intimate partner abuse victims and victims of other violent crimes. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Forced Sex Among the Urban Poor in South India: Implications for HIV Prevention

Author: Solomon, Suniti1; Subbaraman, Ramnath; Solomon, Sunil S; Srikrishnan, Aylur K; Johnson, Sethulakshmi C; Vasudevan, C K; Anand, Santhanam; Ganesh, Aylur K; Celentano, David D1 YR Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education, Chennai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389911?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examined the prevalence of physical and sexual violence among 1,974 married women from 40 low-income communities in Chennai, India. The authors found a 99% and 75% lifetime prevalence of physical abuse and forced sex, respectively, whereas 65% of women experienced more than five episodes of physical abuse in the 3 months preceding the survey. Factors associated with violence after multivariate adjustment included elementary/middle school education and variables suggesting economic insecurity. These domestic violence rates exceed those in prior Indian reports, suggesting women in slums may be at increased risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

Developmental effects of exposure to Intimate Partner Violence in early childhood: A review of the literature

Author: Carpenter, Georgia L; Stacks, Ann M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61420639?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a prevalent social problem in the United States and women of childbearing age are the most likely victims. The young children born to these women are impacted, however, women are not routinely asked about IPV even when there is evidence that their child has been abused. To highlight the importance of routinely screening for IPV in child welfare and other social service agencies this article reviews typical social-emotional development and physiological/neurological development in early childhood and the impact that IPV and trauma have on these domains of development. Early intervention with young children and caregivers living with IPV provides a significant buffer to the negative effects that witnessing IPV have on children's development and their relationships with caregivers.

Is The Antisocial Child Father Of The Abusive Man?: A 40-Year Prospective Longitudinal Study On The Developmental Antecedents Of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Lussier, Patrick1; Farrington, David P; Moffitt, Terrie E1 School of Criminology, Simon Fraser University

Abstract: This prospective longitudinal study examined whether early childhood risk factors contributed to explaining and predicting intimate partner violence (IPV) in midadulthood. Participants included 202 men from the Cambridge longitudinal study who were in an intimate relationship in their mid-40s. Neuropsychological deficits and the presence of a criminogenic family environment were measured between ages 8 and 10. Antisocial behavior was measured between ages 8 and 18. IPV was measured at age 48 using a self-report instrument completed by the participants' female partners. Perpetration and victimization rates were relatively high; violence was mostly mutual, and men were more likely to be victims than perpetrators. Findings indicate that a criminogenic environment increases the risk of IPV by fostering the development of antisocial behavior and neuropsychological deficits. A link also exists between a high level of antisocial behavior during adolescence and the risk of IPV later in life. The results suggest the presence of both continuity and discontinuity of antisocial behavior as childhood risk factors that increase the likelihood of future involvement in IPV, but the role of these risk factors is modest.

Associations Between Perceptions and Involvement in Neighborhood Violence and Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration Among Urban, African American Men

Author: Reed, Elizabeth1; Silverman, Jay G; Welles, Seth L; Santana, Maria Christina; Missmer, Stacey A; Raj, Anita1 Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS, Yale University, 135 College Street, Suite 200, New Haven, CT 06510, USA ereed@hsph.harvard.edu

Abstract: Violence disproportionately affects African American men and their communities. Research is needed to inform programming efforts to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in violence exposure, involvement, and victimization. The current study examined involvement in and perceptions of neighborhood violence and relation to perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) among a sample of urban, African American men. Participants of this cross-sectional study were sexually active African American men (n = 703) between the ages of 18 and 65 years, recruited from urban community health centers. Age-adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess associations between neighborhood violence variables and perpetration of IPV. In age-adjusted logistic regression models, involvement with street violence in the previous 6 months (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.0; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.9 -4.6), ever being involved with gangs (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3 -3.2), and perceptions/beliefs that violence occurs in one's neighborhood (ORs = 2.0 -3.1) were found to be significantly associated with IPV perpetration. Findings demonstrate that involvement in neighborhood violence as well as perceptions/beliefs that violence occurs in one's neighborhood are associated with increased likelihood of IPV perpetration among urban, African American men. While socioeconomics and substance use contribute to high rates of these forms of violence, the relation between these forms of violence and perpetration of IPV was significant beyond the influences of these factors. Findings suggest that future violence prevention and treatment efforts will be most successful by addressing multiple forms of violence. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Family Dysfunction as Risk Factor for Violent Behavior among University Students in North Jordan

Author: Okour, Abdelhakeem M; Hijazi, Heba H

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/813050748?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between family dysfunction and domestic violence with violent behavior of university students in North Jordan. A stratified random sample included 1560 undergraduate students from three universities. The distribution of self- administrated questionnaire was done based on the schedule of registration made by the department of the admission and registration at each university. The results revealed a prevalence rate of 11.9% concerning participation in violence (quarrels) among students at the three universities during the last 3 years. About 16.5% of students who participated in the study indicated that their families suffer from dysfunction. Participation of students in quarrels was significantly affected by witnessing and exposure to domestic violence. Students who participated in the study ranked first the family as institution that contributed to acquiring violent behavior, followed by the surrounding community, media, school, and finally university. In conclusion, domestic violence and family dysfunction appear to be significant factors leading to occurrence of violence among university students.

Measurement of Teen Dating Violence Attitudes

Author: Edelen, Maria Orlando1; McCaffrey, Daniel F; Marshall, Grant N; Jaycox, Lisa H1 RAND Corporation

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61764413?accountid=14925

Abstract: Accurate assessment of attitudes about intimate partner violence is important for evaluation of prevention and early intervention programs. Assessment of attitudes about cross-gender interactions is particularly susceptible to bias because it requires specifying the gender of the perpetrator and the victim. As it is likely that respondents will tend to identify with the same-gender actor, items and scales assessing attitudes about intimate partner violence may not have equivalent measurement properties for male and female respondents. This article examines data from 2,575 high school students who participated in a teen-dating violence intervention study. The majority of participants were Latino (91%), and the sample was nearly evenly split with respect to gender (51% female). Items from two scales (boy-on-girl violence, 4 items; girl-on-boy violence, 5 items) reflecting teens' attitudes about dating violence were calibrated with the graded item response theory (IRT) model and evaluated for differential item functioning (DIF) by gender. A total of three items, two from the girl-on-boy violence scale and one from the boy-on-girl violence scale, were identified as functioning differently for girls and boys. In all cases where DIF was detected, the item's attitudinal statement was easier to accept for the gender group that was portrayed as victim rather than perpetrator. For both scales, accounting for the identified DIF influenced inferences about the magnitude of mean differences in attitudes between boys and girls. These results support the use of IRT scores that account for DIF to minimize measurement error and improve inferences about gender differences in attitudes about dating violence.

Sexual Relationship Power as a Mediator Between Dating Violence and Sexually Transmitted Infections Among College Women

Author: Buelna, Christina1; Ulloa, Emilio C; Ulibarri, Monica D1 San Diego State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61757509?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined relationship power as a possible mediator of the relationship between dating violence and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The proposed mediation model was based on the theory of gender and power as well as previous research on intimate partner violence and STI risk. Survey results from a sample of 290 single, undergraduate women indicated that 85% experienced at least one form of dating violence victimization in the past year, 5.9% tested positive for an STI, and 5.2% received treatment for an STI. Results revealed that women with lower levels of sexual relationship power had higher rates of dating violence victimization and STIs; also, sexual relationship power partially mediated the relationship between dating violence victimization and STIs. Future dating violence and STI-prevention interventions targeting young women may want to use an empowerment approach to decrease their likelihood of dating violence victimization and STI risk.

Mental Health Correlates of Intimate Partner Violence in Marital Relationships in a Nationally Representative Sample of Males and Females

Author: Afifi, Tracie O1; MacMillan, Harriet; Cox, Brian J; Asmundson, Gordon J G; Stein, Murray B; Sareen, Jitender1 University of Manitoba toafifi@exchange.hsc.mb.ca

Abstract: It is important to understand the epidemiology of intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by both males and females. Data were drawn from the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Replication. The relationships between physical IPV and child abuse, mental disorders, and suicidal ideation and attempts among males and females were examined. The results indicate that child sexual abuse was associated with IPV among males, whereas child physical and sexual abuse was associated with IPV among females. IPV was associated with poor mental health outcomes for males and females, although sex differences are noted. The sex differences indicate that females experience a wider range of poor mental health outcomes compared to males. Knowledge about correlates of IPV can be useful in identifying individuals exposed to violence. Further research is required to identify effective methods to reduce exposure to IPV and to adequately address the specific needs of male and female victims of IPV.

Standardization of Karachi Domestic Violence Screening Scale - Urdu Version

Author: Hassan, Sehar1; Malik, Anila Amber1 Department of Psychology, University of Karachi, University Road, Karachi 75270, Pakistan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60328535?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of present paper was to report the preliminary findings of a study aimed at developing a valid and reliable domestic violence screening scale in Urdu language. It will be used as a screening instrument to screen physical, psychological and sexual abuse committed by husbands against wives with specific reference to population in Karachi, who understand Urdu language. The Karachi Domestic Violence Screening Scale ((KDVSS) English Version was developed by first author of this study in her Master's thesis project in 2001. Realizing the need for an Urdu scale, it was decided to develop an Urdu version of Karachi Domestic Violence Screening Scale (KDVSS). The item pool of English Version of KDVSS was used to select items for Urdu Version. The scale was translated, reviewed by experts and then empirically validated through women's reports of experiencing intimate partner violence. This indigenous scale comprised of 35 items organized into five subscales i.e. Abuser Characteristics Sub-scale, Victim Characteristics Sub-scale, Physical Abuse Sub-scale, Psychological Abuse Sub-Scale and Sexual Abuse Sub-Scale. A sample of 200 women taken from different towns of Karachi city participated in study. The findings indicated that the scale has a significant internal consistency measured by Cronbach's Alpha. Karachi Domestic Violence Screening Scale (KDVSS) had good test re-test reliability over a period of one month's time. The values of convergent validity Pearson r (.899) and discriminant validity Pearson r (-.927) were also significant. KDVSS appears to be a screening instrument that is a good screener of domestic abuse committed by husbands against their wives. Adapted from the source document.

"Why doesn't she seek help for partner abuse?" An exploratory study with South Asian immigrant women

Author: Ahmad, Farah; Driver, Natasha; McNally, Mary Jane; Stewart, Donna E

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60307432?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explores why South Asian immigrant women with experiences of partner abuse delay seeking help from professionals. Three focus groups were conducted in Hindi language with South Asian immigrant women in Toronto. Twenty-two women participated with a mean age of 46 years (range 29-68 years). Thematic analysis was conducted on the transcribed data using constant comparison techniques within and across the groups. We found that three major themes emerged from the discussions: reasons for delayed help-seeking, turning points and talking to professionals. Women expressed delaying help-seeking to the point when "Pani sar se guzar jata he" (water crosses over your head). Their dominant reasons for delayed help-seeking were social stigma, rigid gender roles, marriage obligations, expected silence, loss of social support after migration and limited knowledge about available resources and myths about partner abuse. Women usually turned for help only after experiencing pronounced mental and physical health problems. The findings are interpreted in light of participants' immigration context and the socio-cultural norms of patriarchy, collectivism and familism. Prevention approaches to address partner abuse and delayed help-seeking among South Asian immigrant women should include tailored community education, social services to reduce vulnerability, and cultural competency of professionals. Further research and program evaluation is needed to advance the field. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

Domestic Violence and Child Protection: Partnerships and Collaboration

Author: Potito, Christine1; Day, Andrew; Carson, Ed; O'Leary, Patrick1 School of Psychology, Social Work and Social Policy, University of South Australia, Magill, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61386010?accountid=14925

Abstract: The interface between the child protection and domestic violence sectors is often problematic, in that the two sectors operate relatively independently, with little integration. However, it is widely recognised that these sectors need to work more closely to enhance both women's and children's safety. This paper explores the processes needed for the child protection and domestic violence sectors to develop collaborative partnerships that lead to the provision of higher-quality responses to both women and children. Drawing on collaboration theory, a number of barriers to the development of successful partnerships are described, and applied to initiatives that seek to develop integrated approaches between child protection and domestic violence services. It is concluded that there is much scope for the two sectors to work closely together, but that the development of integrated responses involving both child protection and domestic violence services will take a significant commitment, level of determination, and stamina from both parties.

Factors discriminating among profiles of resilience and psychopathology in children exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV)

Author: Graham-Bermann, Sandra A1; Gruber, Gabrielle; Howell, Kathryn H; Girz, Laura1 University of Michigan, Department of Psychology, 530 Church Street Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1109, United States

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61367853?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective To evaluate the social and emotional adjustment of 219 children in families with varying levels of intimate partner violence (IPV) using a model of risk and protection. To explore factors that differentiate children with poor adjustment from those with resilience. Methodology Mothers who experienced IPV in the past year and their children ages 6-12 were interviewed. Standardized measures assessed family violence, parenting, family functioning, maternal mental health, and children's adjustment and beliefs. Results Using cluster analysis, all cases with valid data on the Child Behavior Checklist, Child Depression Inventory, General Self-Worth and Social Self-Competence measures were described by four profiles of children's adjustment: Severe Adjustment Problems (24%); children who were Struggling (45%); those with Depression Only (11%); and Resilient (20%) with high competence and low adjustment problems. Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed children in the Severe Problems cluster witnessed more family violence and had mothers higher in depression and trauma symptoms than other children. Resilient and Struggling children had mothers with better parenting, more family strengths and no past violent partner. Parents of children with Severe Problems were lacking these attributes. The Depressed profile children witnessed less violence but had greater fears and worries about mother's safety. Conclusion Factors related to the child, to the mother and to the family distinguish different profiles of adjustment for children exposed to IPV who are living in the community. Resilient children have less violence exposure, fewer fears and worries, and mothers with better mental health and parenting skills, suggesting avenues for intervention with this population. Practice implications Findings suggest that child adjustment is largely influenced by parent functioning. Thus, services should be targeted at both the child and the parent. Clinical interventions shaped to the unique needs of the child might also be tested with this population. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

Unsettling Power: Domestic Violence, Gender Politics, and Struggles over Sovereignty in Ghana

Author: Hodzic, Saida11 George Mason University, Fairfax, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60350295?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article provides a new lens for analyzing power formations in human rights practices by examining Ghanaian struggles over a Domestic Violence Bill. While the hegemonic character of human rights advocacy is well-established, we know less about exercises of power in discourses and practices that oppose rights. I analyze how the Ghanaian government constructed the discourse of cultural sovereignty and deployed it against women's rights. The government legitimated this discourse by appropriating the voice of 'the people' and superimposing notions of 'foreignness' onto both the Bill and Ghanaian women's rights activists. Drawing on the historiography of colonialism and ethnography of political performance, I argue that this case illustrates how the discourse of cultural sovereignty is mobilized in a struggle over shifting configurations of gender, political activism, and state sovereignty. Adapted from the source document.

WIFE ABUSE IN RURAL BANGLADESH

Author: Dalal, Koustuv1; Rahman, Fazlur; Jansson, Bjarne1 Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Center for Medical Technology Assessment and Division of Social Medicine and Public Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Sweden

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/813143842?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global public health and gender problem, especially in low-income countries. The study focused on verbal abuse, physical abuse and abuse by restricting food provision to wives by their husbands by victim and perpetrator characteristics, emphasizing the socioeconomic context of rural Bangladesh. Using a cross-sectional household survey of 4411 randomly selected married women of reproductive age, the study found that a majority of the respondents are exposed to verbal abuse (79%), while 41% are exposed to physical abuse. A small proportion (5%) of the women had suffered food-related abuse. Risk factors observed were age of the wife, illiteracy (of both victims and perpetrators), alcohol misuse, dowry management, husband's monetary greed involving parents-in-law, and wife's suspicions concerning husband's extramarital affairs. Well-established risk factors for wife abuse, along with dowry and husband's monetary greed, have a relatively high prevalence in rural Bangladesh.

A Decade of Child-Initiated Family Violence

Author: Walsh, Jeffrey A1; Krienert, Jessie L1 Illinois State University, Normal jawalsh@ilstu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60335535?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines 11 years (1995-2005) of National Incident Based Reporting System data comparing victim, offender, and incident characteristics for two types of child-initiated family violence: childa[Euro]"parent violence (CPV) and parricide. The objective is to better understand the victima[Euro]"offender relationship for CPV and parricide and to highlight distinguishing features between the two offenses. This work extends the research and addresses shortcomings in the extant literature. Data analysis consists of chi-square tests and logistic regression. Findings suggest that CPV and parricide are distinct and unique crimes. In short, parricide offenders and victims are both older than CPV offenders and victims, with CPV offenders more likely to be female, more likely to be African American, and less likely to use a weapon than parricide offenders. The study calls for future research and exploration of preliminary support for a family violence escalation hypothesis. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Abstract: This article examines 11 years (1995-2005) of National Incident Based Reporting System data comparing victim, offender, and incident characteristics for two types of child-initiated family violence: child-parent violence (CPV) and parricide. The objective is to better understand the victim-offender relationship for CPV and parricide and to highlight distinguishing features between the two offenses. This work extends the research and addresses shortcomings in the extant literature. Data analysis consists of chi-square tests and logistic regression. Findings suggest that CPV and parricide are distinct and unique crimes. In short, parricide offenders and victims are both older than CPV offenders and victims, with CPV offenders more likely to be female, more likely to be African American, and less likely to use a weapon than parricide offenders. The study calls for future research and exploration of preliminary support for a family violence escalation hypothesis.

Play Context, Commitment, and Dating Violence

Author: Gonzalez-Mendez, Rosaura1; Hernandez-Cabrera, Juan Andres1 University of La Laguna, Spain

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61354140?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study develops a structural equation model to describe the effect of two groups of factors (type of commitment and play context) on the violence experienced during intimate partner conflict. After contrasting the model in adolescents and university students, we have confirmed that aggressive play and the simulation of jealousy and anger increase the risk of dating victimization during conflicts through the negative reactions that they cause. Where commitment is concerned, the results are different according to whether commitment is personal or constraining. The former provides protection against dating victimization, reducing risk in the play context, whereas the latter has no effect on the violence experienced but facilitates a more dangerous play dynamic. The model can be applied in the design of programs to prevent dating violence. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Dating Violence and Girls in the Juvenile Justice System

Author: Kelly, Patricia J1; Cheng, An-Lin; Peralez-Dieckmann, Esther; Martinez, Elisabeth1 University of Missouri-Kansas City kellypj@umkc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60327850?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to explore the prevalence and associated behaviors of dating violence among a population of girls in the juvenile justice system. A sample of 590 girls from an urban juvenile justice system completed a questionnaire assessing attitudes and self-efficacy about and occurrence of dating violence. The analysis developed a random effect model to determine a risk profile for dating violence. The strongest predictors of dating violence were (a) initial sexual experience at age 13 or earlier, (b) unwillingness of initial sexual experience, (c) drug use, and (d) low self-efficacy about preventing dating violence. The high prevalence of dating violence and associated behaviors among participants suggests the importance of implementing primary prevention programs to assist preteen girls in delaying initial sexual intercourse and in learning techniques to prevent dating violence.

'In Our Culture'--How Debates about Zimbabwe's Domestic Violence Law Became a 'Culture Struggle'

Author: Christiansen, Lene Bull11 Department of Society and Globalization, Roskilde University, Denmark

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60333206?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article analyses a debate about the political definition of 'culture' and 'tradition' in Zimbabwe, sparked by the introduction of domestic violence legislation in 2006. The debate is analysed against the back-drop of the Zimbabwean government's nationalist identity politics, rhetorically dubbed the 'Third Chimurenga', in which insiders and outsiders of the nation are depicted via a cultural and historical discourse of indigenous authenticity. The relations of gender and power which are inherent to this political discourse are analysed as functioning through the formulation of discourses of marriage, Christianity, and 'tradition', which are the contested elements in the debates. The article concludes that the nationalist discourses of the government were maintained as the discursive framework within which the debates about the legislation could take place. And while those who opposed the law saw it as an attack on patriarchal powers, the law can from an analytical point of view also be seen to transfer patriarchal authority from the private sphere to the authorities. Furthermore, the debates over the definition of Zimbabwe's 'culture' and 'tradition' are seen as part of a contingent process of cultural and political change, which the Zimbabwean women's movement is engaged in. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810402414?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: Results of testing the original four-factor structure of the URICAa[Euro'DV as well as two three-factor structures in prior researches is presented to investigate alternative structures suitable for Korean batterers. Method: This study developed the URICAa[Euro'DV Korean Version and sought the most appropriate structure for a Korean context. The sample is 293 batterers either referred by the courts, by prosecution, or who participated voluntarily. Results: The original four-factor model and the two three-factor models are demonstrated as possessing poor model fit index and fail to be accepted as apt models for a Korean context. The suggested three-factor model is a better fit according to confirmatory factor analysis. Conclusion: Findings and further discussion for practical implications and research are presented.

Community influences on intimate partner violence in India: Women's education, attitudes towards mistreatment and standards of living

Author: Boyle, Michael H; Georgiades, Katholiki; Cullen, John; Racine, Yvonne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389581?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) directed towards women is a serious public health problem. Women's education may offer protection against IPV, but uncertainty exists over how it might reduce risk for IPV at the community and individual levels. The objectives of this study are to: (1) disentangle community from individual-level influences of women's education on risk for IPV; (2) quantify the moderating influence of communities on individual-level associations between women's education and IPV; (3) determine if women's attitudes towards mistreatment and living standards at the community and individual levels account for the protective influence of women's education; and (4) determine if the protective influence of education against IPV is muted among women living in communities exhibiting attitudes more accepting of mistreatment. Study information came from 68,466 married female participants in the National Family Health Survey conducted throughout India in 1998-1999. Multilevel logistic regression was used to address the study objectives. IPV showed substantial clustering at both the state (10.2%) and community levels (11.5%). At the individual level, there was a strong non-linear association between women's education and IPV, partially accounted for by household living standards. The strength of association between women's education and IPV varied from one community to the next with evidence that the acceptance of mistreatment at the community level mutes the protective influence of higher education. Furthermore, women's attitudes towards mistreatment and their standards of living accounted for community-level associations between women's education and IPV. Place of residence accounted for substantial variation in risk of IPV and also modified individual-level associations between IPV and women's education. At the community level, women's education appeared to exert much of its protective influence by altering population attitudes towards the acceptability of mistreatment. However, there was no residual association between women's education and IPV at the community level once living standards are taken into account. While women's education provides strong, independent leverage for reducing the risk of IPV, planners must keep in mind important community factors that modify its protective influence.

Religion and intimate partner violence in Chile: Macro- and micro-level influences

Author: Lehrer, Evelyn L; Lehrer, Vivian L; Krauss, Ramona C

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61769807?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Catholic Church has had a strong influence on the Chilean legal and social landscape in ways that have adversely affected victims of intimate partner violence; e.g., it succeeded until just five years ago in blocking efforts to legalize divorce. At the same time, quantitative studies based on survey data from the United States and other countries show a generally favorable influence of religion on health and many other domains of life, including intimate partner violence. The present study explores the puzzle posed by these seemingly opposing macro- and micro-level forces. Results based on data from the 2005 Survey of Student Well-Being, a questionnaire on gender-based violence administered to students at a large public university in Chile, show that moderate or low levels of religiosity are associated with reduced vulnerability to violence, but high levels are not. This non-linearity sheds light on the puzzle, because at the macro level the religious views shaping Chile's legal and social environment have been extreme. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

Developing Teen Dating Violence Prevention Strategies: Formative Research with Middle School Youth

Author: Noonan, Rita K1; Charles, Dyanna1 Division Unintentional Injury, Centers Disease Control & Prevention

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61339555?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) peaks in youth and young adulthood and is associated with multiple adolescent risk behaviors and negative health outcomes. Targeting youth with prevention messages before they start dating may avert teen dating violence and subsequent adult IPV. This article discusses findings from focus groups with middle school youth to determine behaviors and beliefs regarding dating violence. To develop effective prevention messages, participants were asked questions about characteristics of middle school dating relationships, healthy relationships, relationship norms, unhealthy relationships, emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, intervening in violent situations, and trusted sources for information about dating violence. The recommendations for prevention efforts include an emphasis on skill building, tailoring efforts for particular subgroups, and identifying innovative ways of reaching youth.

The Functions of Gender Role Traditionality, Ambivalent Sexism, Injury, and Frequency of Assault on Domestic Violence Perception: A Study between Japanese and American College Students

Author: Yamawaki, Niwako1; Ostenson, Joseph; Brown, C Ryan1 Dept Psychology, Brigham Young U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59988524?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the mediating influence of gender-role traditionality (GRT), ambivalent sexism, and victim injury and frequency of assault on domestic violence (DV) perception differences between Japanese and American college students. As predicted, Japanese tended to minimize, blame, and excuse DV more than did Americans, and these national differences were mediated by GRT. Participants viewed the DV incident more seriously when the victim presented injury or when the incident had occurred frequently. Those high in benevolent and hostile sexism were more likely to minimize DV, whereas those high only in benevolent sexism were more likely to blame the victim.

Using Conditional Sentences in Domestic Violence Cases: A New Brunswick Exploration

Author: Gill, Carmen1; Theriault, Luc1 Director Muriel McQueen Fergusson Centre for Family Violence Research; Associate Professor, Department of Sociology, University of New Brunswick

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1030869059?accountid=14925

Abstract: Conditional sentencing was introduced in Canada in 1996 and has since gained momentum in the justice system as an alternative to incarceration. The New Brunswick Advisory Council on the Status of Women (2006) reports a growing use of conditional sentences in woman abuse cases as well as a decrease in the average jail time imposed on convicted abusers. In this article, we explore the use of conditional sentencing in the Province of New Brunswick, comparing domestic violence cases for which a conditional sentence was issued against a random sample of domestic violence cases from the year 2004. Key variables examined included the nature of the previous criminal record (if any) of the accused, the level of violence used, the perception the victim has of her safety, and the relationship between the victim and the accused, Results indicate that none of the selected variables had a significant effect on the use of conditional sentencing. Adapted from the source document.

Differences in Types of Intimate Partner Violence: Implications for Public Policy

Author: Baird, Anne Carroll11 Morehouse College abaird@morehouse.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347780771?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence has been recognized as a serious social problem in the United States since the 1970s, when the leaders in the Women's Movement became alarmed at victimization of women in their own homes by their husbands or boyfriends (Dobash and Dobash 1992). Women still make up 70 percent of all intimate partner homicides, and are twice as likely to be killed by an intimate partner as men are (Catalano, Smith, Snyder, and Rand 2009). The Anti Violence against Women Acts of 1994 and subsequent years have led to more uniform state policies on domestic violence and other violence against women, but have been used to justify intrusion into private homes, particularly with mandatory arrest laws (Davis, O'Sullivan, Farole, and Remple 2008). The law has not been successful at specific deterrence (Peterson 2008), but it has been more effective at punishment (Dixon 2008). Treating all domestic violence cases as though they were the same also has implications for treatment programs (Peterson 2008; Saunders 2008). In this article, I consider the importance of making distinctions among types of intimate partner violence, the effects of failure to do so, along with implications for research, advocacy, and treatment. Adapted from the source document.

Child-inclusive mediation in cases of domestic violence in Australia

Author: Hart, Amanda Shea11 Social Worker

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61360462?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence is a common driver of family dissolution. Cases involving domestic violence are core business in the Australian family law jurisdiction. Family mediation is growing as an alternative to litigation for separated families in dispute over parenting arrangements. The specialized intervention of child-inclusive mediation is increasingly used to resolve family disputes in the best interests of the child. However, this child-empowering practice is often avoided by mediators where domestic violence is an issue. This article identifies some complex factors that need to be addressed and researched for appropriate development and use of child-inclusive mediation to enhance social justice for child subjects of parenting disputes from violent families. Adapted from the source document.

Perceptions of research and practice among domestic violence researchers

Author: Murray, Christine E; Smith, Paige Hall

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862597445?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents the results of a study involving 261 domestic violence researchers representing a variety of professional disciplines. The purpose of this study was to identify researchers' perceptions of the connections between research and practice in domestic violence. The study builds on previous literature that identified a gap between research and practice in domestic violence. Through a factor analysis of the Domestic Violence Research-Practice Perceptions Scales: Researcher Form, a new instrument developed for this study, a four-factor conceptual framework for understanding the domestic violence research-practice gap was identified. The four factors identified were labelled as follows: (a) personal practice orientation, (b) beliefs about practitioners, (c) beliefs about researchers, and (d) beliefs about a research-practice gap. Researchers were shown to differ in their scores on the first factor subscale based on whether they had prior experience of providing services to clients affected by domestic violence and whether domestic violence is the primary focus of their research agenda. Implications of the findings for integrating research and practice in domestic violence are then discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Gender inclusive systemic treatment of intimate partner abuse (GIST)

Author: Hamel, John

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862598378?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Western, industrial nations, there is a high level of gender symmetry in intimate partner abuse. Nevertheless, efforts to reduce domestic violence have been stymied by public policies that favour rigid, feminist models based on flawed theories of patriarchy, and that stereotype males as perpetrators and females as victims. The treatment model advanced in this paper, developed by the author and used in his family violence clinic near San Francisco, California, is based on an accumulated body of research evidence on the etiology and characteristics of intimate partner abuse. Partner abuse cannot be fully understood without considering that the family typically involves mutual dynamics, and requires interventions based on a systemic assessment and understanding of each case. In this model, all modalities may be utilised, and treatment proceeds in a three-phase approach to maximize both treatment effectiveness and victim safety. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Molina, Olga1; Lawrence, Shawn A; Azhar-Miller, Aisha; Rivera, Marlene1 School of Social Work, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368619?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the experiences of Latina immigrants who are divorcing and in domestic violence support groups (DVSGs). To gain an understanding of the client perspective, an ex-post facto research design was utilized with the data collection taking place after the members had terminated with the DVSG services. The convenience sample consisted of 15 Latina women. A questionnaire was used to determine the women's satisfaction with the group services. Results indicated that overall the group experience was positive, with 80% of the women reporting an overall 'excellent' experience and 20% reporting an overall 'good' experience. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Maternal Reports of Young Children's Functioning

Author: Zerk, Danielle M1; Mertin, Peter G; Proeve, Michael1 University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia danielle.zerk@health.sa.gov.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61361859?accountid=14925

Abstract: Maternal reports of 60 preschool-aged children were used to investigate trauma responses to living in households where domestic violence was present. Post-trauma symptoms were measured using developmentally modified criteria based on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Mothers' level of anxiety, depression, somatization, and self-reported parenting stress were also assessed. Results suggested that, in addition to clinical levels of Internalizing, Externalizing and Total Problem scores on the CBCL, young children displayed a range of post-trauma symptoms. Mothers reported a high level of violence, and a significant relationship was found between self-reported levels of distress and parenting stress. Parenting stress was found to be the strongest predictor of children's scores on the CBCL. Although domestic violence alone was not significantly correlated to child outcomes, results indicated that maternal distress adversely impacted on the parent-child relationship. The importance of the child's relationship with the primary caregiver was discussed. Implications regarding further research, developmentally appropriate diagnostic criteria, and early interventions with the primary caregiver are highlighted. Adapted from the source document.

Family Variables that Mediate the Relation Between Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and Child Adjustment

Author: Owen, Ashley E; Thompson, Martie P; Shaffer, Anne; Jackson, Emily B; Kaslow, Nadine J

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811363099?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the mediating roles of several family variables in the relation between IPV witnessing and children's emotional and behavioral problems among 129 low-income, African American children ages 8 to 12. According to the mediational model tested, experiencing or witnessing IPV negatively impacted the following family variables: maternal psychopathology, family cohesion, and relatedness quality, which were subsequently associated with diminished child adjustment. These findings were stronger when child reports were considered and when the outcome variable was internalizing problems. Findings from this study support the value of targeting these variables in the development of culturally appropriate child witness interventions for low-income African American families. Recommendations for future interventions based on study conclusions are offered.

Asian Male Domestic Violence Victims: Services Exclusive for Men

Author: Cheung, Monit1; Leung, Patrick; Tsui, Venus1 University of Houston, Houston, TX, 77204-4013, USA mcheung@uh.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59975311?accountid=14925

Abstract: The main reasons abused men do not seek social services include their strong endorsement of social/cultural values and avoidance of gender role conflict. Through internet-based service connections, we did not find sources in Asia, Australia, or New Zealand that advertised programs exclusively for male victims of domestic violence (DV). Nine social services in Hong Kong and Singapore describe their work with men in DV situations, but the main focus is "men as perpetrators." Targeting men as victims, 32 sources in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom describe services designed especially for male DV victims. Findings demonstrate that services for male victims must address such factors as secretiveness, cultural values, masculine identity, tolerance, shame, and loss of face. Adapted from the source document.

Work-Home Conflict and Domestic Violence: A Test of a Conceptual Model

Author: VanBuren Trachtenberg, Jennifer; Anderson, Stephen A; Sabatelli, Ronald M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811366024?accountid=14925

Abstract: The relationship between work-home conflict and domestic violence is examined using data from 295 adults, who worked full time and were in serious relationships. Job satisfaction, gender, gender role attitudes, type of employment, and socioeconomic status were examined as predictors of work-family conflict. Backward stepwise regression analysis revealed that job satisfaction was the only predictor of work-home conflict. Regression analyses were again conducted to determine the moderating effects of general well-being, alcohol use, family of origin violence witnessed or experienced, communication skills, and social support on the relationship between work-home conflict and domestic violence. Both family of origin violence witnessed and personally experienced were revealed as moderators of this relationship. The remaining potential moderators were submitted to regression analyses to determine if they might, instead, be mediators. These analyses revealed that negative communication skills and social support mediated the relationship between work-home conflict and domestic violence.

Implications of Treating Family Violence for the Therapist: Secondary Traumatization, Vicarious Traumatization, and Growth

Author: Ben-Porat, Anat1; Itzhaky, Haya1 Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, 52900, Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60010823?accountid=14925

Abstract: Our study dealt with the positive and negative implications of working with victims of family violence on therapists in terms of secondary traumatization, vicarious traumatization, and growth. In addition, we examined positive and negative changes that the therapists experienced in themselves, their lives, and their families as a result of their work. The research population consisted of 143 social workers employed in the field of family violence, and 71 social workers who were not employed in that field. Comparisons between the two groups were conducted for all of the research variables. The two groups did not differ significantly in levels of secondary traumatization. However, significant differences were found in levels of growth, as well as in levels of positive and negative changes that the participants experienced in themselves, their lives, and their families. Adapted from the source document.

Exposure to Intimate Partner Violence Amongst Women of Reproductive Age in Lagos, Nigeria: Prevalence and Predictors

Author: Okenwa, Leah E; Lawoko, Stephen; Jansson, Bjarne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811369592?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on predictors of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in Sub-Saharan Africa is contradictory, necessitating further investigation. This study sought the prevalence and predictors of IPV among women in Lagos, Nigeria. Questionnaire data from 934 women visiting an obstetrics and gynecology clinic in Lagos were analyzed using multivariable methods. The 1year prevalence of IPV was 29%, with significant proportions reporting psychological (23%), physical (9%) and sexual (8%) abuse. In-access to information, women's autonomy and contribution to household expenses independently predicted IPV. The findings provide new incites for IPV prevention in Lagos with implications for further research.

Universal Screening and Assessment for Intimate Partner Violence: The IPV Screen and Assessment Tier (IPV-SAT) Model

Author: Todahl, Jeffrey L1; Walters, Elaine1 College of Education, Couples and Family Therapy, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388145?accountid=14925

Abstract: In recent years researchers have examined the advantages and disadvantages of intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening in medical settings. This article describes the IPV Screen and Assessment Tier (IPV-SAT), a model that adapts findings from the screening research literature for family therapy and family therapy settings. IPV-SAT provides a framework and a decision-making protocol for conducting an IPV screen, an IPV assessment, and an IPV danger assessment. This article outlines screening and assessment procedures, specific screening and assessment questions, and principles for responding to disclosures of violence. Important considerations for creating a safe context for screening and assessment, and strategies for handling confidentiality, particularly when working with couples from a systemic framework, are outlined. Implications for family therapy training and pressing research questions are described. Adapted from the source document.

Community Violence, Social Support Networks, Ethnic Group Differences, and Male Perpetration of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Raghavan, Chitra1; Rajah, Valli; Gentile, Katie; Collado, Lillian; Kavanagh, Ann Marie1 John Jay Coll Criminal Justice craghavan@jjay.cuny.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60314512?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors examined how witnessing community violence influenced social support networks and how these networks were associated with male-to-female intimate partner violence (IPV) in ethnically diverse male college students. The authors assessed whether male social support members themselves had perpetrated IPV (male network violence) and whether female social support members had been victimized by intimates (female network victimization). The results indicated an association between community violence and male network violence; both factors were significantly associated with higher levels of IPV. Furthermore, the relationship between community violence and IPV was partially mediated by male network violence. Additionally, the results indicated a moderated relationship such that male participants who reported the highest levels of exposure to community violence and male network violence were at highest risk for IPV. However, this relationship did not hold across all ethnicities and races. The findings suggest that the mechanisms associating community violence, networks, and IPV are multifaceted and differ across ethnicity and race.

Sex, Attribution, and Severity Influence Intervention Decisions of Informal Helpers in Domestic Violence

Author: Chabot, Heather Frasier1; Tracy, Tracy L; Manning, Christine A; Poisson, Chelsea A1 New England College hchabot@nec.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60336484?accountid=14925

Abstract: Most domestic violence (DV) researchers examine professional intervention (e.g., police and nurses), but informal helpers (e.g., friends and bystanders) are critical. The authors measure undergraduates' intervention likelihood, type of involvement (i.e., contact with abuser), and the influence of attribution decisions in DV situations where the abuser's sex is manipulated. Self-esteem and other personal variables are not found to be influential, but participants intervene more when the abuser is male and if they have experienced childhood abuse. The influence of attributions in DV situations is influenced by the sex of the attacker and severity of the attack. Participants' attributions for male attackers predict intervention in severe cases of DV; attributions of drunkenness predict more intervention. In general, informal male helpers choose more risky types of intervention than female helpers do, and more aggressive individuals choose less helpful behaviors than those lower in aggression. Stigma reduction associated with DV and intervention, especially among male victims, and the importance of encouraging appropriate involvement among helpers are discussed.

Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Israel, Emily1; Stover, Carla1 Yale University Child Study Center

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60316256?accountid=14925

Abstract: The issue of the father-child relationship has been greatly ignored in the domestic violence research literature. This study investigated whether intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrated by biological fathers resulted in higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms and behavior problems than violence perpetrated by nonbiological fathers and whether children who witnessed violence perpetrated by multiple father figures had increased levels of posttraumatic stress disorder and behavioral symptoms. Eighty mothers who experienced domestic incidents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the University of California at Los Angeles Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index (PTSD-RI) for their children aged 2 to 18. Children with multiple violent father figures had significantly more symptoms on the CBCL than children in the other two research groups while controlling for maternal symptoms and trauma history. There were no significant differences between the biological and nonbiological father groups or among the three groups on the PTSD-RI.

Community and Family Violence: Indirect Effects of Parental Monitoring on Externalizing Problems

Author: Fowler, Patrick J1; Toro, Paul A; Tompsett, Carolyn J; Baltes, Boris B1 Department of Psychology, DePaul University, 2219 North Kenmore Avenue, Room 420, Chicago, IL 60614, USA E-mail: pfowler3@depaul.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61370214?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the mediating role of parenting on the relationship between exposure to violence and externalizing problems. Participants include 214 at-risk urban adolescents. Structured interviews assessed exposure to community and family violence, parental monitoring and warmth, as well as substance abuse and conduct problems. Structural equation modeling provided evidence of a mediation model that fits European Americans but is less predictive for African Americans. For European Americans, findings suggest greater exposure to community violence is associated with more externalizing problems, and also indirectly effects problems by disrupting parental monitoring. Although family violence relates to less parental warmth, no association exits between warmth and externalizing problems. Unmeasured variables that contribute to racial differences may explain how violence impacts African American teens. Adapted from the source document.

Acculturation and Dating Violence Victimization Among Filipino and Samoan Youths

Author: Chung-Do, Jane J1; Goebert, Deborah A1 Asian/Pacific Islander Youth Violence Prevention Center, University of Hawai'i, Manoa, 1441 Ala Moana Blvd. #1806, Honolulu, HI 96814, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61366246?accountid=14925

Abstract: Dating violence victimization is an important public health issue. Recent studies on minority youths have found higher risks of dating violence victimization compared to White youths. This study examined the influence of acculturation components on youths' experiences of dating violence by utilizing data from a survey of 193 Samoan and Filipino youths in Hawai'i. We found that parental role (punishment) and gender roles (appearance, female empowerment) were associated with verbal abuse dating violence victimization. We found that gender role (appearance) and ethnic identity (out-group orientation) were associated with controlling dating violence victimization. Ethnic identity (i.e., ethnic identity achievement = having strong commitment to own ethnicity) was a protective factor for controlling dating violence victimization. Parental roles may mediate gender role attitudes and ethnic identity in immigrant youths. This highlights the need for culturally-tailored dating violence prevention and intervention efforts for youths and their families. Adapted from the source document.

Psychometric Properties of a New Scale to Assess Family Violence in Older African American Women: The Family Violence Against Older Women (FVOW) Scale

Author: Paranjape, Anuradha1; Rodriguez, Michael; Gaughan, John; Kaslow, Nadine J1 Temple University School of Medicine anuradha.paranjape@temple.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368791?accountid=14925

Abstract: Absence of a conceptually grounded, comprehensive measure for family violence in older women has hindered attempts to define the extent of the problem and its effects on older women's health. This article reports the development and psychometrics of the Family Violence in Older African American Women Scale, a comprehensive scale to measure family violence in older women. The scale demonstrates two distinct factors: (a) 'Abuse' and (b) 'Caregiving Failure,' which measure abusive behaviors in the context of a family relationship and caring for older women, respectively. Implications for the use of this scale in research and practice settings are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

The Victim-Informed Prosecution Project: A Quasi-Experimental Test of a Collaborative Model for Cases of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Cattaneo, Lauren Bennett1; Goodman, Lisa A; Epstein, Deborah; Kohn, Laurie S; Zanville, Holly A1 George Mason University, Fairfax,VA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61401158?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Victim-Informed Prosecution Project (VIP) was designed to amplify the voice of the victim in the prosecution of a battering current or ex-partner through collaboration between the prosecution and victim-centered agencies. This article describes the rationale for and design and implementation of VIP and then explores whether it increased perceived voice. While some VIP services (advocacy and civil protection order representation) were associated with increased perceived voice, the program as a whole was associated with it only in the context of greater contact with prosecutors, when cases were more likely to be felonies. We make specific recommendations for applying this model. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Older African American Women and Barriers to Reporting Domestic Violence to Law Enforcement in the Rural Deep South

Author: Lichtenstein, Bronwen1; Johnson, Ida M1 Department of Criminal Justice, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60306494?accountid=14925

Abstract: Victims of domestic violence are legally entitled to police protection, but multiple barriers exist in contacting law enforcement. In this study, we used Federal Bureau of Investigation data, key informant interviews, and focus groups to examine barriers to reporting domestic violence among older African American women in the rural Deep South. Three primary barriers were identified: gender roles, age dependency, and mistrust of law enforcement. The main finding was that reports of domestic violence were deterred by fears of being stigmatized by church, family, and community. The one compelling and feasible resolution is for law enforcement to take a leadership role in educating clergy and other community leaders about domestic violence as a crime against older women. Adapted from the source document.

The mental health of children who witness domestic violence

Author: Meltzer, Howard1; Doos, Lucy; Vostanis, Panos; Ford, Tamsin; Goodman, Robert1 *Professor of Mental Health and Disability,

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810499081?accountid=14925

Abstract: ABSTRACTThere is now considerable evidence that witnessing domestic violence can have adverse consequences for children. Our aim is to present the socio-demographic correlates of children witnessing domestic violence and its association with childhood mental disorders. The biographic, socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics of 7865 children and their families and measures of traumatic events including witnessing domestic violence were entered into a logistic regression analysis to establish the strength of association between witnessing severe domestic violence and childhood disorders. About 4% of children had witnessed severe domestic violence according to parent reports. Factors independently associated with a greater likelihood of a child witnessing domestic violence were: older age group, mixed ethnicity, physical disorder, several children in family, divorced parents, living in rented accommodation, poor neighbourhoods, the mother's emotional state and family dysfunction. Witnessing severe domestic violence almost tripled the likelihood of children having conduct disorder but was not independently associated with emotional disorders. There is a growing need for more research on the consequences of witnessing domestic violence to increase the awareness of social workers and policy-makers to identify the needs of children who witness domestic violence.

Abstract: The aim of this article is, by analysing children's discourses, to investigate their actions or absence of actions during a domestic violence episode. The empirical data are recorded group therapy sessions and individual interviews with children who have grown up experiencing their fathers' violence against their mothers. The analysis shows that the children's stories contain two aspects of actions: one related to the actions during the ongoing episode, and one the child perceives as possible/ desirable for the future. The findings are discussed in the light of Lazarus and Folkman's theory of coping. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

Expanding 'Community' in the Community Response to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Pennington-Zoellner, Kendra11 Northeastern State University, 3100 East New Orleans Street, Broken Arrow, OK, 74104, USA zoellner@nsuok.edu

Abstract: Community coordination refers to a formalized system of collaboration between various social service agencies to help meet the needs of specific populations. In cases of intimate partner violence (IPV), community coordination includes a system of policies, information sharing, and referrals between the criminal justice system and counseling centers and shelters for survivors. The life model of social work practice suggests that social workers utilize both formal and informal groups as environmental resources for clients. In an effort to address the failures of community coordinated responses to IPV, community needs to be reconceptualized to include these additional groups, especially employers.

The Downside of Patriarchal Benevolence: Ambivalence in Addressing Domestic Violence and Socio-Economic Considerations for Women of Tamil Nadu, India

Author: Tichy, Lauren L1; Becker, Judith V; Sisco, Melissa M1 University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85719, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60328087?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social values and status cause diverse obstacles for escaping abuse (e.g., belief in the sanctity of marriage vs. financial necessity to stay for survival). India provides a unique opportunity to explore the interplay of status and corresponding patriarchal values in relation to the incidence of domestic violence and how it is viewed, coped with, and psychologically impacting native women. Sixty-four women of Tamil Nadu, India were surveyed. Women of higher status were found to be less likely to acknowledge abuse as a societal problem, accurately identify abuse events, and seek help or report abuse. Women who had more realistic conceptions of abuse were more likely to seek help but also likely to experience more severe psychological distress. All of the women surveyed had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder that were exacerbated by unsuspected variables. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of public health strategies. Adapted from the source document.

Community Capacity Building as a Strategy of Family Violence Prevention in a Problem-Stricken Community: a Theoretical Formulation

Author: Chan, Yuk-chung1; Lam, Gladys L T; Cheng, Howard C H1 Department of Applied Social Sciences, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China ssycchan@polyu.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61363355?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines problems confronting the families in a multi-problem community in Hong Kong, from an ecological perspective, and the features and limitations of the existing approach taken by the Government to combat the family violence problem in that community. It suggests the use of the community capacity building model as a strategy of family violence prevention, discusses the rationale, and explores the parameters of the community capacity building model that can be used to fight the family violence problem.

Domestic Violence against Women in Jordan: Evidence from Health Clinics

Author: Al-Nsour, Mohannad; Khawaja, Marwan1; Al-Kayyali, Ghadah1 Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon, mk36@aub.edu.lb

Abstract: To explore women's attitudes toward intimate partner violence (IPV) and their determinants, as well as to document the prevalence of various types of violence among women attending public health centers in the Balka region, Jordan. A cross-sectional study among ever-married women aged 18-49 who visited the public health clinics in the governorate of Balka, Jordan, was carried out in August 2006. A total of 356 women was successfully interviewed. Descriptive statistics and adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression were used to assess associations between attitudes towards IPV and selected background variables. The vast majority (87%) of women reported different types of IPV against them in the last 12months. The most common types of reported violence were emotional abuse (47.5%), followed by wife beating (19.6%). Almost one-third of women justified wife beating by husbands. Older age, younger age at marriage, rural residence, and non-working status were significantly associated with supportive attitudes towards wife beating. The study shows a high prevalence of IPV against women during the past year, and a high rate of justifications for wife beating. Increasing women's empowerment, particularly economic security through work outside the home, may protect women from violent behavior in this context.

Predicting Conduct Problems from Community and Family Violence: The Moderating Effects of Hurricane Katrina

Author: Vigna, Julia F; Hernandez, Brittany C; Kelley, Mary Lou11 Department of Psychology, Louisiana State University, 236 Audubon Hall, Baton Rouge, LA, 70803, USA, mkelley@lsu.edu

Abstract: Although the devastation was immediately apparent, the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the behavior of youth are just now being revealed. Much post-disaster research targets adjustment of adults, but ample evidence indicates that youth experience a variety of psychological symptoms following a disaster, including depressive symptoms, aggression, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress. The aim of the current study was to determine whether hurricane exposure serves as a risk factor for developing conduct problems among violence-exposed youth. Results indicate that hurricane exposure had differential effects on the relations between conduct problems and community violence versus corporal punishment in the home. Though not statistically significant, there was an unexpected trend for youth with high hurricane exposure to show decreased conduct problems and those with low hurricane exposure to show increased conduct problems as violence exposure increased. Hurricane exposure played the predicted role in the relation between corporal punishment and conduct problems, such that high levels of hurricane exposure predicted increased conduct problems among youth experiencing high levels of corporal punishment, but not among those experiencing low levels of corporal punishment. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

The Time Course of Repeat Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Mele, Marie11 Department of Criminal Justice, Monmouth University, 400 Cedar Avenue, West Long Branch, NJ, 07764, USA mmele@monmouth.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61394887?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the time course of repeat victimization by assessing whether the opportunity for victim/offender contact influences the time lapse between successive incidents of intimate partner violence. Several measures of opportunity for victim/offender contact are used, including cohabitation, co-parenting, restraining order status, and victim unemployment. The study finds that some victims (i.e., those who live with the offender) are at risk of repeat victimization in a shorter period of time than other victims. However, the study yields conflicting findings about the relationship between other opportunity variables (i.e., co-parenting and victim unemployment) and the time lapse between successive incidents of intimate partner violence. Policy implications are discussed and suggestions are offered for future research on repeat intimate partner violence. Adapted from the source document.

Do Judicial Responses to Restraining Order Requests Discriminate Against Male Victims of Domestic Violence?

Author: Muller, Henry J1; Desmarais, Sarah L; Hamel, John M1 Public Policy Research, 8984 Autumnwood Drive, Sacramento, CA, 95826, USA, rmuller@dgs.ca.gov

Abstract: Every state in the United States authorizes its courts to issue civil orders of protection for victims of domestic violence. Ideally, restraining orders should be available to all victims. However, consistent with the patriarchal paradigm, research suggests that judicial responses to domestic violence temporary restraining order (TRO) requests may be sex-differentiated. This paper reports on a study that explored equal protection issues in family law by evaluating gender and violence profiles of a random sample of 157 TRO petitions involving intimate partners, dating couples, and married persons in a California district court. The majority of cases involved allegations of low or moderate levels of violence perpetrated by male defendants against female plaintiffs. Although there were no systematic differences in level of violence as a function of plaintiff sex, judges were almost 13 times more likely to grant a TRO requested by a female plaintiff against her male intimate partner, than a TRO requested by a male plaintiff against his female partner. Further analyses revealed that this sex differentiation was limited to cases involving allegations of low-level violence.

Abstract: The Migrant Clinicians Network's Familias con Voz (Families with a Voice) project aims to train migrant men and women to become intimate partner violence (IPV) peer educators in their communities. In preparation for implementing educational activities, a community survey was conducted with 298 participants in three Texas border counties. Verbal abuse, such as name calling, was the most frequent type of violence reported. Men perceived anger as a cause of partner violence significantly more than women. Only 22% of respondents reported knowing of a shelter they could turn to for help. Surprisingly, a majority of participants cited "seeking help from the police" when asked about ways to decrease partner violence. Survey results offer insight into developing effective intervention programs by capturing the intended audiences' beliefs and attitudes. Additionally, survey results reveal possible strategies for how to tackle IPV in U.S.-Mexico border migrant farmworker communities. Adapted from the source document.

Gender Symmetry, Sexism, and Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Allen, Christopher T1; Swan, Suzanne C; Raghavan, Chitra1 University of South Carolina allenct@mailbox.sc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60318794?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study of a predominantly Hispanic sample of 92 male and 140 female college students examines both gender symmetry in intimate partner violence (IPV) and inconsistent relationships found in previous studies between sexist attitudes and IPV. Results indicate that although comparable numbers of men and women perpetrate and are victimized in their relationships with intimate partners, the path models suggest that women's violence tends to be in reaction to male violence, whereas men tend to initiate violence and then their partners respond with violence. Benevolent sexism was shown to have a protective effect against men's violence toward partners. Findings highlight the importance of studying women's violence not only in the context of men's violence but also within a broader sociocultural context.

English-Speaking and Spanish-Speaking Domestic Violence Perpetrators: An MMPI-2 Assessment

Author: Scott, Ronald L1; Flowers, John V; Bulnes, Alejandro; Olmsted, Eileen; Carbajal-Madrid, Pedro1 Chapman University scott@chapman.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61374742?accountid=14925

Abstract: The use of assessments to characterize domestic violence perpetrators continues to develop with an emphasis on increasing the effectiveness of domestic violence interventions. The present study examines and compares Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)-2 responses from 41 English-speaking and 48 Spanish-speaking men who were in court-mandated domestic violence treatment programs. Data are analyzed on all validity, clinical, supplementary, and content scales using composite means and cluster analyses. Although there are significant differences between the 2 groups on 12 scales, no scale shows significant clinical elevations (T >' xbd='1182' xhg='1161' ybd='1650' yhg='1612'/> 65) for either language cohort. Three perpetrator subgroups are identified using a methodology similar to that used in previous MMPI-2 studies: nonpathological, antisocial, and otherwise psychologically disturbed. The proportion of participants falling into each of the 3 groups, for both English and Spanish speakers, is similar to that found in other studies. The results are discussed in terms of cultural influences and the need for treatment approaches tailored to characteristics of each personality type.

Correlates of Dating Violence Among Male and Female Heavy-Drinking College Students

Author: Roudsari, Bahman S1; Leahy, Matthew M; Walters, Scott T1 University of Texas School of Public Health bahman.roudsari@utsouthwestern.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60329342?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the correlates for dating violence among heavy-drinking college students. Method: Participants were at least 18 years old and reported at least one heavy-drinking episode in the past 2 weeks. Results: After covariate adjustment, estimated peak blood alcohol concentration during the past month was associated with higher victims' verbal-emotional abuse score, and perpetrators' verbal-emotional abuse and threatening abuse scores ( N = 280). In addition, being non-White was significantly associated with higher victims' threatening abuse, physical abuse, and total abuse scores and perpetrators' threatening abuse and physical abuse scores. Moreover, male students had significantly lower victims' threatening abuse and physical abuse scores and perpetrators' threatening abuse scores compared to female students. Discussion: Preventive programs that target dating violence among heavy-drinking college students should consider alcohol use as an important risk factor for abusive behaviors, both for the victims as well as the perpetrators.

The Perceived Impact of a Child Maltreatment Report From the Perspective of the Domestic Violence Shelter Worker

Author: Steen, Julie A11 University of Central Florida jsteen@mail.ucf.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60326592?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to examine domestic violence shelter workers' perceptions of child maltreatment reporting. A sample of 82 professionals from domestic violence shelters across the United States participated in a survey focusing on a variety of different types of reports and the frequency of both positive and negative outcomes arising from these reports. Possible outcomes included in the study are damage to the relationship between the worker and the battered woman, disempowerment of the battered woman, discouragement from seeking further help, protection of the child, further traumatization of the child, further disruption to the family, and damage to the woman's likelihood of maintaining custody. Significant differences in perceived impact are found based on identity of abuser (spousal batterer vs. battered woman) and nature of report (child as witness to domestic violence vs. child as victim of abuse). These results point to the complexity of perceptions regarding the impact of reporting. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Pink or Blue ... Black and Blue? Examining Pregnancy as a Predictor of Intimate Partner Violence and Femicide

Author: Taylor, Rae1; Nabors, Erin L1 University New Orleans rtaylor@loyno.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368988?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explores the effect of pregnancy on women's risk of IPV victimization. Previous studies have produced conflicting findings and have been limited by comparing only two categories of IPV. The current study included analyses of the effect of pregnancy on three statuses of IPV: no abuse, nonlethal abuse, and lethal abuse. The data used for this project are taken from the first phase of the Chicago Women's Health Risk Study (CWHRS). Findings suggest that both nonlethal and lethal abuse statuses differ significantly from no abuse in that women's risk of IPV victimization may decrease during pregnancy.

Intimate Partner Violence and Social Isolation Across the Rural/Urban Divide

Author: Lanier, Christina1; Maume, Michael O1 University of North Carolina, Wilmington lanierc@uncw.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61385823?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive social problem that affects victims, families, and communities. Beginning with the acknowledgment of this phenomenon as a social problem, investigations have attempted to answer questions regarding the extent, prevalence, and the possible contributing social and psychological factors that influence this behavior. This study proposes an approach to the problem of IPV based on a unifying concept: social isolation. The authors argue that the utility of the concept of social isolation lies in its ability to encapsulate critical social-structural and social-psychological correlates of IPV. The main objective of the study is to examine the extent to which the role of social isolation in predicting IPV varies by urban/rural context. Measures of key variables were obtained from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Survey of Families and Households and the 1990 census. Results of multivariate analyses indicate that only some measures of social support (isolation) are statistically significant and only for families within rural (nonmetropolitan) counties.

Secondary Traumatic Stress Among Domestic Violence Advocates: Workplace Risk and Protective Factors

Author: Slattery, Suzanne M1; Goodman, Lisa A1 Berklee College of Music, Boston sslattery@berklee.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61398669?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study identified workplace factors associated with secondary traumatic stress (STS) in a sample of 148 domestic violence advocates working in diverse settings. Findings indicate that coworker support and quality clinical supervision are critical to emotional well-being and that an environment in which there is shared power -- that is, respect for diversity, mutuality, and consensual decision making -- provides better protection for advocates than more traditional, hierarchical organizational models. Furthermore, shared power emerged as the only workplace variable to significantly predict STS above and beyond individual factors. The discussion includes implications for practice and policy as well as directions for future research. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Intimate Partner Violence Victimization and Parenting Stress: Assessing the Mediating Role of Depressive Symptoms

Author: Renner, Lynette M11 University of Iowa lynette-renner@uiowa.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61398565?accountid=14925

Abstract: Guided by the spillover hypothesis and process model of parenting, this study examined relationships between intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization and parenting characteristics among a sample of 1,153 lower-income women. Hierarchical regression was used to investigate a mediational model examining women's self-reports of physical and psychological IPV, depressive symptoms, and parenting stress. Results suggest that depressive symptoms partially mediate the link between a mother's psychological IPV victimization and later self-reported parenting stress. Findings from this study highlight the importance of including maternal psychopathology and other stress and support variables when assessing parenting outcomes among women with histories of IPV.

Promoting the Safe and Strategic Use of Technology for Victims of Intimate Partner Violence: Evaluation of the Technology Safety Project

Author: Finn, Jerry1; Atkinson, Teresa1 Social Work Program, U Washington, Tacoma finnj@u.washington.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388296?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Technology Safety Project of the Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence was designed to increase awareness & knowledge of technology safety issues for domestic violence victims, survivors, & advocacy staff. The project used a "train-the-trainer" model & provided computer & Internet resources to domestic violence service providers to (a) increase safe computer & Internet access for domestic violence survivors in Washington, (b) reduce the risk posed by abusers by educating survivors about technology safety & privacy, & (c) increase the ability of survivors to help themselves & their children through information technology. Evaluation of the project suggests that the program is needed, useful, & effective. Consumer satisfaction was high, & there was perceived improvement in computer confidence & knowledge of computer safety. Areas for future program development & further research are discussed.

Sequence and Timing of Three Community Interventions to Domestic Violence

Author: Hovmand, Peter S1; Ford, David N1 George Warren Brown School of Social Work, Washington University in St. Louis, Campus Box 1196, One Brookings Drive, St. Louis, MO, 63130, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810450720?accountid=14925

Abstract: Community responses to domestic violence typically involve the introduction of multiple interventions. Yet very little is known about the impact of the timing and sequencing of these interventions on community outcomes. A reason for this is the inherent limitations of traditional methods in social science. New methods are needed to understand the effect of varying the sequence and timing of interventions. This study responds to the issue by introducing system dynamics as a method for modeling community interventions. The paper presents a model of domestic violence cases moving through a criminal justice response, and uses the simulation model to evaluate the impact of implementing three interventions-mandatory arrest, victim advocacy, and changes in level of cooperation-on two system-level outcomes: improving offender accountability and increasing victim safety. Results illustrate the complex nature of these relationships. Implications for community practice and future research are also discussed.

The Legal Battle Against Domestic Violence In India: Evolution And Analysis

Author: Karanjawala, Tahira1; Chugh, Shivani1 Amity Law School, New Delhi, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60317988?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the post-independence era, the Indian woman has been the subject of numerous laws, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 being one of the latest and certainly the most controversial addition to the list. While it has been eagerly awaited in certain sections as a step that should significantly strengthen the position of Indian women within the family unit, it has been widely criticized as being ambiguous, discriminatory, and even potentially dangerous. This article seeks to analyse this controversial legislation in the context of its socio-economic background and the legal developments that led to its enactment. Moreover, an attempt has been made to critically examine its provisions, and to highlight its implications, both positive and negative. Further, a comparison has been made between this enactment and other similar legislation in various other countries. Finally, the article seeks to put into perspective the overall impact that this legislation would have on the family unit and the social fabric of India. Adapted from the source document.

Influence of intimate partner violence on behaviour, psychological status and school performance of children in Sri Lanka

Author: Jayawardena, Pushpa1; Perera, Hemamali1 Visiting Fellow, School of Public Health, Latrobe University, Melbourne VIC, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743056208?accountid=14925

Abstract: This cross-sectional analytical study aimed to determine the influence of intimate partner violence (IPV) on behaviour, psychological status and school performance of children among a randomly selected sample of 14- to 17-year-old school children in the Chilaw MOH area of Sri Lanka. The study unit was mother-child dyads (N = 828 pairs) and the exposure (IPV) was assessed in mothers using a modified Abuse Assessment Questionnaire. The main outcomes were assessed in their children using a self-completed version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and reviewing school records. IPV was statistically significantly associated with all three outcomes studied separately when applying multivariate analysis for abnormal behaviour and psychological status, for school performance and for school attendance. It was concluded that IPV has a significant influence on a child's behaviour and psychological status, school performance and attendance. Adapted from the source document.

Impact of domestic violence on the psychological wellbeing of children in Iran

Author: Ghasemi, Masoumeh11 Department of Social Sciences, Marvdasht Islamic Azad University, Marvdasht, Iran

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887285847?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents the results of a study that examined the psychological wellbeing of a community sample of children in Iran (N=53) exposed to domestic violence, comparing them to a clinical comparison group without exposure to domestic violence. The results replicated past findings of elevated levels of trauma symptomatology in this population. Further, children exposed to domestic violence differed significantly from unexposed children with respect to somatic symptoms and hostility. Specifically, higher domestic violence was associated with higher somatic symptoms and hostility levels. These results indicate that children exposed to domestic violence have different physical and psychological health to controls and may be physiologically and psychologically traumatised by virtue of exposure to domestic violence.

'Suddenly she realizes that her husband is not exactly Rabbi Akiba ...' - perceptions of mas culinity of ultra-Orthodox Israeli Jewish battering men

Author: Goldberg, Oded1; Yassour-Borochowitz, Dalit1 Center for Prevention of Domestic Violence, Ashdod, Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60343389?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of the study reported in this article is to gain an understanding of the way in which haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Israeli Jewish batterers perceive and experience both their masculinity and their violent behaviour towards their wives. The study attempts to understand how the masculinity-intimate violence-culture relationship exists in the haredi community, which is both religious and patriarchal. This is a qualitative study and is based on 11 interviews with haredi men who behaved violently towards their spouses. Four central themes describe the characteristics of masculinity: two of which describe the man's principal roles - Torah study and providing for his family - and two that describe a man's ideal attributes - restraint and self-control, rationality and sagacity. Emerging from the interviewees' responses is the difficulty of realizing the male ideal as they presented it, and in this context violent behaviour is actually construed as a failure. In addition, the changes being undergone in women's status in the haredi society intensify the conflicts felt by the men regarding their male identity. The present study indicates the considerable importance of cultural and social factors in understanding intimate violence against women, especially with respect to gender shaping and identity. Adapted from the source document.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Among Sri Lankan University Students as a Consequence of Their Exposure to Family Violence

Author: Haj-Yahia, Muhammad M1; Tishby, Orya; de Zoysa, Piyanjali1 Hebrew University of Jerusalem

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60339622?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article presents the results of a study on the association between exposure to family violence (i.e., witnessing interparental violence and experiencing parental violence) during childhood and adolescence and adult posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study was conducted among a self-selected convenience sample of 476 students from Sri Lanka, using a self-administered questionnaire. The findings indicate that the more participants witnessed interparental violence and the more they experienced parental violence, the more they exhibited PTSD symptoms. Moreover, the findings reveal that participants' exposure to family violence explains a significant amount of the variance in their PTSD over and above the variance that can be attributed to their sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, number of siblings, and family's socioeconomic status) and to their perceptions of the environment and functioning of their families. The limitations of the study and recommendations for future research are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major source of morbidity and mortality nationally. Trauma Centers can be very helpful for victims of IPV but there may be variability in IPV resource provision. A survey was mailed to each of the 65 Trauma Centers in Illinois. Stata and EZ-Text statistical software were used for analysis. Eighty-three percent of trauma centers returned the survey. Ninety percent of respondents had an IPV screening policy. All but one Center reported having IPV services available, including social work (93%) and 24 hour/day IPV teams (7%). Most Centers felt their IPV services were adequate (69%), but 22% felt services were inadequate, particularly resource availability. Trauma Centers in the state of Illinois are generally succeeding at screening for IPV. However, there is lack of uniformity with respect to screening and services, suggesting that there is room for improvement. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Women's 'Justification' of Domestic Violence in Egypt

Author: Yount, Kathryn M1; Li, Li1 Emory University kyount@sph.emory.edu

Abstract: We explored the influences of women's social learning, marital resources and constraints, and exposure to norms about women's family roles on their views about wife hitting or beating among 5,450 participants in the 2005 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey. One half justified wife hitting or beating for some reason. Women from rural areas who were exposed to domestic violence more often justified such acts. Dependent wives whose husbands had more schooling, were blood relatives, and were coresident more often justified such acts. In settings where women tended to marry at older ages, women less often justified such acts. Women's resources and constraints in marriage accounted for the largest share of the variability in their attitudes about domestic violence against women. Adapted from the source document.

Fathers' Rights Groups, Domestic Violence and Political Countermobilization

Author: Crowley, Jocelyn Elise11 The Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 33 Livingston Ave, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 jocelync@rutgers.edu

Abstract: Domestic violence continues to be a serious problem for women in the United States. As a result, the battered women's movement has been tireless in campaigning for greater awareness of the issue, tougher penalties against offenders, and public vigilance against potential batterers, including fathers from dissolving families. In reaction to this stance, a small but vocal countermovement composed of activists in the fathers' rights movement has argued that the BWM is guilty of what I term enemy boundary creep, a perception whereby these men maintain that they have been inappropriately targeted. Using 40 in-depth interviews with fathers' rights activists located across the country, this article details the narrative that these men have composed as to why the BWM is expanding the scope of its enemies, the tactics that the BWM is using in this campaign, and the insidious effects that these efforts are having on fathers across the country. This narrative formulates a boundary-push back response. This analysis thus articulates how an unlikely countermovement can use the accusation of enemy boundary creep by its social movement opponents in an effort to shift the political discourse on a significant public problem. Adapted from the source document.

Preventing Homelessness due to Domestic Violence: Providing a Safe Space or Closing the Door to New Possibilities?

Author: Netto, Gina1; Pawson, Hal; Sharp, Cathy1 School of the Built Environment, Heriot Watt University g.netto@hw.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61402906?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence has been recognized as a major contributory factor to homelessness in the UK and elsewhere, with women more likely to be affected. In the UK and other countries undergoing welfare reform, moves toward 'active citizenship' increase the complexity of the relationship between states and citizens and open up new strategies for both. However, analysts have noted some strategies can create new forms of inequality, including gender-based ones. This article considers the impact of prevention-centred homelessness policy responses to domestic violence, with specific reference to the 'Sanctuary' model. Sanctuary schemes support women facing homelessness due to domestic violence to remain in their current residence, protected against attack from outside the home. Drawing on analysis of the literature and empirical work, we compare the experiences of women who have used traditional forms of support and Sanctuary services. We argue that while the model has the potential to provide greater autonomy to some women in these circumstances, it is not appropriate for all. Increased emphasis on Sanctuary schemes could make it more difficult for women who might prefer to move. We conclude that more attention needs to be paid to addressing the origin of women's homelessness due to domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

How to Tell a New Story About Battering

Author: Polletta, Francesca11 University of California, Irvine polletta@uci.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60341708?accountid=14925

Abstract: As Evan Stark observes, getting domestic violence against women recognized as coercive control will require a major effort of storytelling. Women's accounts of subjugation have to be narrated in a way that is both true to their experiences and capable of eliciting public understanding, sympathy, and action. This essay draws on an interdisciplinary literature on narrative to show why doing that poses such a formidable challenge. In lieu of the tragic form that has dominated battered women's storytelling, and in lieu of the quest and mystery forms that appear in Stark's own accounts, this article argues for using a rebirth story line. This genre, which has affinities with the fairytales Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, seems an unlikely vehicle for asserting battered women's combination of victimization and agency. Drawing on the stories told by battered women as part of a successful reform effort, however, this article shows how women have used the form effectively.

Does Police Intervention in Intimate Partner Violence Work? Estimating the Impact of Batterer Arrest in Reducing Revictimization

Author: Cho, Hyunkag; Wilke, Dina J

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/853217786?accountid=14925

Abstract: A variety of societal interventions in intimate partner violence have been established for decades, including the police actively arresting perpetrators. However, it is difficult to find consistent study results to show if arrest is effective. Moreover, there are far fewer studies on victims than on perpetrators. This study utilized the National Crime Victimization Survey to examine if victims whose partners were arrested were less revictimized than those whose partners were not arrested. Results clearly showed that arrest of perpetrators was effective in reducing revictimization, controlling for victims' characteristics and the nature of violence incidents. Also, separated or divorced women showed the highest risk of revictimization. Comparisons with previous studies and implications on police policies are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

The "Gallinazo" at School. Domestic Violence and Social Construction of Masculinity in the Paramo of Sumapaz in Colombia

Author: Alvarez, Santiago11 IDES-IDEAS, U Nacional San Martin, Argentina

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/754041800?accountid=14925

Abstract: This text analyses the relations between domestic violence & ideas & practices that produce the social construction of what a peasant man has to be in a town at the foot of the Paramo of Sumapaz in the Colombian Andes. Observing the male behavior, the author describes how violence, aggression, the hard work of the land, alcohol, the control of home & extramarital adventures expressed force & power that is transforms in respect. In this fashion, the rich & mature peasant is considered a powerful man & respected as such. In contrast, the young poor peasant, you have to be excessively aggressive because he is obliged to show his might in order to be considered & respected socially. In a community where the power relations are unstable & fluid, violence is used to construct a self. Aggression & competition are central elements in the social construction of masculinity. In spite of this, the aggressive actions against women & children are not perceived as violence but as Internal problems of any couple or family. In fact, when women protest for the beatings they do it internally & do not put these matters in the legal system. In this way, the author show as to difficulty: the perception of to behavior is seen in a different way by the observed & by the researcher. These behaviors are not stigmatized by actors, find that the other strategies to deal with violent actions. Adapted from the source document.

Methods: As part of a World Health Organization multi-national study, data were collected through face-to-face interviews with a stratified, multistage sample of 1371 women aged 1849 in the city of Yokohama. Methods of survival analyses were used to assess relationships among women's experiences in childhood (e.g., sexual abuse or exposure to IPV against the mother), timing & nature of sexual initiation, & IPV. Results: Three percent of the women reported having been sexually abused during childhood by someone they knew, & 7% reported childhood sexual abuse by strangers. Estimated prevalence of physical IPV was 17.70% & 8.49% for sexual IPV. Childhood sexual abuse by known perpetrators, exposure to IPV against the mother, & early sexual initiation, independently contributed to an elevated probability of experiencing IPV in adulthood. Conclusions: The high estimated probability of childhood sexual abuse & IPV, & the significant association between the two forms of victimization indicate a need for increased prevention efforts beginning in childhood & adolescence & prior to initiating intimate relationships.

The Impact of an Interim Protection Order (Domestic Violence Act 116 of 1998) on the Victims of Domestic Violence

Author: Vogt, Tertia1; Greeff, Abraham P1 Department of Psychology, Stellenbosch University, Private Bag Xl, Matieland 7602, Republic of South Africa

Abstract: The primary objectives of this study were to determine the impact of the interim protection order (IPO) on the nature and extent of domestic violence, the general well-being of the victims of domestic violence, and the efficiency of the application procedure for the IPO. A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental research design was used on an experimental (n = 884) and a control (n = 125) group. The results indicated that the IPO had a significant impact on certain aspects of physical, psychological, and social well-being and in some areas of domestic violence. The IPO did not have a significant impact on the participants' experiences of their personal, communal, environmental, and transcendental well-being. Application procedures were found to be satisfactory in most areas. Adapted from the source document.

Women's Subjectivities of Suffering and Legal Rhetoric on Domestic Violence: Fissures in the Two Discourses

Author: Sen, Rukmini11 Rukmini Sen is Junior Fellow at the Centre for Women's Development Studies, New Delhi, India senrukmini18@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/818807863?accountid=14925

Abstract: It is undoubtedly true that feminist politics in the last three decades has struggled to make visible an entire range of social practices that are inimical to women and brought them under the rubric of 'violence'. This article revisits the meaning of violence when translated in the language of law. In the courtroom, the meaning of violence has to be technically grounded as the law would want it to be, filtering from it many nuances that possibly existed at the time when the aggrieved woman was narrating her incident. This article therefore is an exploration of the legal rhetoric engaging with violence as faced by women within marriage; it argues that there is often a strong disjuncture with the subjectivities of suffering primarily due to the legal need for objective evidence. There are three parts: (a) how violence has been understood by the women's movement in India, (b) an analysis of some legal documents that understand primarily physical violence and (c) an exploration on the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which through legal language makes a formal provision on translating suffering.

Dealing with Domestic Violence towards Complicating the Rights Discourse

Author: Suneetha, A1; Nagaraj, Vasudha1 A. Suneetha is currently Fellow at Anveshi Research Centre for Women's Studies, Hyderabad, India suneethaasrv@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/822521871?accountid=14925

Abstract: The discourse on domestic violence in India is animated by the language of rights and empowerment in which domestic violence is seen as the condition that needs to be overcome. It imagines the women facing violence as would-be citizen-subjects, who can actualise their right against violence once the law and institutions are set in order. Inadequate institutionalisation of right against violence and inadequate individuation of women are understood to be the major problems here. In this article, we problematise these two assumptions by taking a close look at women's interface with public institutions in the context of domestic violence. One, we point to the resources women need to mobilise in the family and community to actualise their right against this violence; two we argue that institutionalisation of this right has led to women being subject to governmental mode of power and three, we discuss the actual deployment of this right in everyday activism as a political goal, than a guarantee against violence. We suggest that a critical consideration of the working of this 'right' is required to understand the changing contours of women's battles with this violence in the post-1990 period.

A cross-national analysis of physical intimate partner violence against women

Author: Kaya, Yunus1; Cook, Kimberly J1 University of North Carolina Wilmington, USA kayay@uncw.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835112229?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study investigates the cross-national correlates of intimate partner violence against women with a sample of 40 developed and less developed countries. Specifically, we analyze physical intimate partner violence against women during the 12 months prior to data collection, using data from nationally representative surveys. In the process, we examine the evidence for three explanations we discern from the literature: empowerment of women, cultural context (i.e. religion, institutions), and globalization. The results of our analyses provide strong support for the empowerment of women explanation, which draws from feminist concerns regarding socio-economic status of women, and reveal some effect of cultural context and globalization. Female labor force participation in non-agricultural sectors and women's secondary school enrollment decrease the likelihood of intimate partner violence while increasing total fertility rate signals more partner violence. Religious fractionalization and dependence on high-income countries as export partners also increase the likelihood of intimate partner violence against women.

A Qualitative Evaluation of the Effects of Mandatory Reporting of Domestic Violence on Victims and Their Children

Author: Antle, Becky1; Barbee, Anita; Yankeelov, Pam; Bledsoe, Linda1 Kent School of Social Work, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61358349?accountid=14925

Abstract: This purpose of this research was to evaluate the mandatory reporting law for domestic violence victims in the state of Kentucky through the qualitative interview of 24 female victims of domestic violence. Victims were generally supportive of the law and felt that professionals should be required to report domestic abuse. They did not feel that the report placed them at higher risk of revictimization or loss of their children to child protective services. The women were offered and utilized a range of supportive services. Criticisms of the process included the 'secrecy' of contact, a simplistic conceptualization of family violence, and failure by police to act on the report. This research offers preliminary support for mandatory reporting as an effective intervention for domestic violence from the perspective of victims. Adapted from the source document.

Attachment as a Moderator Between Intimate Partner Violence and PTSD Symptoms

Author: Scott, Shelby1; Babcock, Julia C1 Department of Psychology, University of Houston, 126 Heyne Building, Houston, TX 77204-5022, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743063728?accountid=14925

Abstract: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms have been linked to traumatic experiences, including intimate partner violence. However, not all battered women develop PTSD symptoms. The current study tests attachment style as a moderator in the abuse--trauma link among a community sample women in violent and non-violent relationships. Both attachment anxiety and dependency were found to moderate the relation between intimate partner violence and PTSD symptoms. However, attachment closeness did not function as a moderator. Differences in attachment may help to explain why certain victims of domestic abuse may be more susceptible to experiencing PTSD symptoms. Clinically, these findings may aid in the prediction and prevention of PTSD symptoms in women victimized by intimate partner abuse. Adapted from the source document.

The Effects of Child Abuse and Exposure to Domestic Violence on Adolescent Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior Problems

Author: Moylan, Carrie A1; Herrenkohl, Todd I; Sousa, Cindy; Tajima, Emiko A; Herrenkohl, Roy C; Russo, MJean1 School of Social Work, University of Washington, 4101 15th Ave NE, Seattle, WA, 98105, USA, cmoylan@u.washington.edu

Abstract: This study examines the effects of child abuse and domestic violence exposure in childhood on adolescent internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Data for this analysis are from the Lehigh Longitudinal Study, a prospective study of 457 youth addressing outcomes of family violence and resilience in individuals and families. Results show that child abuse, domestic violence, and both in combination (i.e., dual exposure) increase a child's risk for internalizing and externalizing outcomes in adolescence. When accounting for risk factors associated with additional stressors in the family and surrounding environment, only those children with dual exposure had an elevated risk of the tested outcomes compared to non-exposed youth. However, while there were some observable differences in the prediction of outcomes for children with dual exposure compared to those with single exposure (i.e., abuse only or exposure to domestic violence only), these difference were not statistically significant. Analyses showed that the effects of exposure for boys and girls are statistically comparable.

The Interrelationship Between Substance Abuse and the Likelihood of Arrest, Conviction, and Re-offending in Cases of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Hirschel, David1; Hutchison, Ira W; Shaw, Meaghan1 Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology, University of Massachusetts Lowell, 870 Broadway Street, Lowell, MA 01854, USA josephdavid@msn.com

Abstract: The nexus between substance abuse and intimate partner violence has been studied in depth. The interrelationship between substance abuse, intimate partner violence, and the criminal justice system response and subsequent offending has not received as much attention. In this article, the authors examine the impact of substance abuse on the likelihood of an officer's decision to make an arrest, conviction in that case, and subsequent re-offending. The authors find that while official decision-making remains unaffected by the fact that the offender has been drinking and/or using drugs, substance abuse and subsequent re-offending are inextricably interlinked. These findings highlight the need to screen domestic violence offenders for alcohol/drug abuse, and provide offenders manifesting these problems with alcohol/drug treatment in addition to batterer treatment. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Services: Historical Concerns and Contemporary Challenges

Author: Macy, Rebecca J1; Giattina, Mary C; Parish, Susan L; Crosby, Carmen1 U North Carolina, Chapel Hill rjmacy@email.unc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368561?accountid=14925

Abstract: More than 20 years ago, concerns were raised about whether domestic violence and sexual assault agencies need for stable funding would conflict with the values that initiated these respective movements. Since then, the movements have evolved considerably. Therefore, it is timely to investigate the challenges domestic violence and sexual assault agencies face today. This exploratory study used focus groups and interviews to identify the challenges facing North Carolina domestic violence and sexual assault movements from the perspectives of agency directors and funding staff. Using an open-coding approach, seven challenges were identified including funding, sustainability, community norms, tension between grassroots versus professional service providers, lack of attention to sexual assault, the need for welcoming services for all survivors, and the need for comprehensive services to help survivors with co-occurring mental illnesses and substance abuse problems. The findings also pointed to recommendations for ways to address these challenges. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

An Examination of Whether Coordinated Community Responses Affect Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Post, Lori Ann1; Klevens, Joanne; Maxwell, Christopher D; Shelley, Gene A; Ingram, Eben1 Yale School Medicine

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61384862?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study tests the impact of coordinated community response (CCR) on reducing intimate partner violence (IPV) and on modifying knowledge and attitudes. The authors conduct hierarchical linear modeling of data from a stratified random-digit dial telephone survey (n = 12,039) in 10 test and 10 control sites, which include 23 counties from different regions in the United States, to establish the impact of a CCR on community members' attitudes toward IPV, knowledge and use of available IPV services, and prevalence of IPV. Findings indicate that CCRs do not affect knowledge, beliefs, or attitudes of IPV, knowledge and use of available IPV services, nor risk of exposure to IPV after controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, income, and education. Women in communities with 6-year CCRs (as opposed to 3-year CCRs) are less likely to report any aggression against them in the past year. These results are discussed within the context of evaluation challenges of CCRs (e.g., IPV activities in comparison communities, variability across interventions, time lag for expected impact, and appropriateness of outcome indicators) and in light of the evidence of the impact of other community-based collaborations.

Does It Make Any Difference if She Is a Mother?: An Interactional Perspective on Intimate Partner Violence With a Focus on Motherhood and Pregnancy

Author: Vatnar, Solveig Karin Bo1; Bjorkly, Stal1 Ulleval U Hospital solveig.vatnar@kompetanse-senteret.no

Abstract: The authors report on the impact of motherhood and pregnancy on interactional aspects of intimate partner violence (IPV) among help-seeking women. Is having children a protective or a risk factor for IPV severity, injury, duration, frequency, and mortal danger, controlling for sociodemographics? Regarding interactional aspects of IPV, do survivors who experience IPV during pregnancy differ from those who do not? Is IPV during pregnancy characterized by different severity, injury, frequency, and mortal danger? A representative sample of women was interviewed. Motherhood increased the risk for longer duration of physical, psychological, and sexual IPV, even controlling for duration of partnership. Combinations of main categories of IPV during pregnancy were different from when not pregnant. Duration of physical and psychological IPV was the only variable increasing the likelihood of experiencing IPV during pregnancy. All physical IPV variables were significantly lower during pregnancy. For psychological IPV, all variables but frequency were lower. Only mortal danger was significantly lower in the sexual IPV main category.

Challenging Assumptions: Clergy Perspectives and Practices Regarding Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Dyer, Jacqueline11 Boston College, Boston, Massachusetts

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741611923?accountid=14925

Abstract: Many individuals in African-American communities turn to their pastors for help with domestic violence; however, very little is known about actual clergy perspectives and practices regarding intimate partner violence. A single-interview template was designed to gain insight into the thinking of eight clergy on this topic. The findings of this study provide insight regarding perspectives and practices used by clergy to address partner violence, many of which are compatible with clinical best practices. They also provide understanding about the attitudes or interventions possibly encountered by victims of intimate partner violence in some churches. Adapted from the source document.

Victim-Offender Mediation in Cases of Intimate Relationship Violence-Ideals, Attitudes, and Practices in Finland

Author: Uotila, Erika1; Sambou, Saija1 Department of Criminal Policy, Ministry of Justice, Government of Finland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835113127?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Finland the first experimental mediation projects founded on the principles and ideals of restorative justice were started in the beginning of the 1980s. Before the Act on Mediation in Criminal and Certain Civil Cases (1015/2005) came into force in 2006, mediation services were provided by cities, municipalities, and non-governmental organizations. Victim-offender mediation (VOM) practices varied, and there was minimal guidance and supervision by state authorities. The Act (1015/2005) aimed to standardize mediation services and practices and enable evaluation of VOM in order to provide solutions to some of the issues raised regarding mediation in intimate relationship violence (IRV). The Act states that only police or prosecutors may initiate the process for referring a case that involves intimate relationship violence. Furthermore, mediators/facilitators who handle IRV cases are required to attain further training. This article examines the ideals, attitudes, and practices of VOM in relation to intimate relationship violence in Finland. The aims and ideals stipulated in the Act on Mediation are presented and later compared to actual practices of VOM which were obtained through the review of documented agreements. These were the end-results of VOM in cases of intimate relationship violence. The empirical data also included a questionnaire sent to mediators in three offices as well as a national questionnaire sent to prosecutors. Adapted from the source document.

Children Exposed to Domestic Violence: Conclusions from the Literature and Challenges Ahead

Author: Overlien, Carolina11 Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, Oslo, Norway carolina.overlien@nkvts.unirand.no

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61361218?accountid=14925

Abstract: Summary: This article examines and discusses the research field of children exposed to domestic violence, a field which has greatly expanded during the last 10 years. The author presents an overview of this research, discusses its implications, and describes future challenges and contemporary knowledge gaps. Findings: The author argues that the field is dominated by studies that a) are quantitative, b) use the mothers as the informant and c) are represented by traditional psychology and social medicine, rather than social work. These studies have found substantial support for the negative emotional and behavioral consequences that children exposed to domestic violence suffer. However, many questions and problems remain unanswered. These questions include both the research field itself and the need for new approaches such as qualitative research including the voice of the child, longitudinal studies, and questions regarding methodology and research ethics.

The Role of Employee Assistance Programs in Workplace-Based Intimate Partner Violence Intervention and Prevention Activities

Abstract: Given the widespread impact of intimate partner violence (IPV) on the workplace it is critical to understand the involvement of Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) in workplace-focused IPV activities. Representatives from a diverse set of 28 external EAPs participated in an 'inventory' of practices related to IPV. The study found that the IPV services available to customer companies at the worksite are extensive and primarily include assistance with policy development, delivery of trainings and seminars, delivery of educational/awareness-raising activities, and provision of management/security staff consultation. Yet companies' lack of awareness regarding the role of IPV as a workplace issue challenges the ability of EAPs to deliver extensive workplace-based IPV services. Adapted from the source document.

For a better understanding of the peculiarities of domestic violence experienced by Aboriginal women in Canada

Abstract: Aspects that are unique to conjugal violence as experienced by Aboriginal women are often ignored and confounded with those of other groups of abused women in Canada. This article presents an analysis of documents from different sources of knowledge that have been produced over the last three decades in order to identify distinctive dimensions of this problem. The analysis points to the significance of the notion of family violence over other terms that are used to describe conjugal violence and to the different facets of Aboriginal women's experiences of violence with regards to prevalence, severity and forms of violence. Adapted from the source document.

Interventions for Perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence: A Review of Efficacy Research and Recent Trends

Author: Murphy, Christopher M; Ting, Laura A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753991761?accountid=14925

Abstract: The efficacy of psychosocial interventions for perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV) has been increasingly challenged in recent years, largely in response to reviews of research showing limited program effects. This article addresses the state of the art in research on IPV perpetrator interventions. After considering previous quantitative reviews of research in this area, new trends and innovations are addressed, including culturally focused interventions, case management and comprehensive services, supportive efforts to enhance program attendance, and interventions focused on motivation to change. Recent research has failed to provide clear evidence that race-specific groups or culturally focused content enhances the efficacy of standard IPV interventions. Similarly, research exploring case management for IPV perpetrators revealed important problems in implementation of the intervention and no clear evidence of improved outcomes. However, some evidence indicates that the integration of substance use interventions may enhance violence reduction. Supportive interventions designed to enhance program attendance and motivation to change have yielded consistently encouraging results, including significant effects on program attendance, compliance with IPV intervention tasks, and increased personal change and help-seeking efforts. These interventions have shown favorable initial effects in reducing abusive behavior relative to treatment-as-usual controls, and they are highlighted as a potentially fruitful avenue for continued research. Adapted from the source document.

Guiding as Practice: Motivational Interviewing and Trauma-Informed Work With Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: [Unknown]

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753991775?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over the last five years, a new paradigm has emerged in social services. Numerous social service providers are now being asked to provide treatment within a framework of trauma-informed care. Trauma-informed services recognize the pervasive impact of current and previous violence on the everyday lives of many clients. Such services prioritize the establishment of a safe, trusting relationship where trauma can be disclosed. Trauma-informed services also account for the potential effects of clients' experiences of violence and trauma on their relationship to treatment and to treatment providers. This article describes trauma-informed services and the potential that Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based, client-centered, and guiding communication style, holds for utilization within trauma-informed work. A case vignette is provided which demonstrates primary MI skills that can be used to create a climate of safety and trust, and effectively elicit and strengthen clients' motivation for change. A discussion of the case and ethical aspects associated with MI in trauma-informed work is also provided. In addition, suggestions are made as to the potential MI holds for further use with traumatized clients. Adapted from the source document.

The Evolution of Services for Male Domestic Violence Victims at WEAVE

Author: Rooney, Margaux

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992093?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence victim service providers are challenged to create programs that are responsive to a broad range of clients who are diverse in gender and sexual orientation and present with a spectrum of abuse histories and complex co-occurring conditions. The scope of victim services needs to be examined and adjusted in order to better address the complicated issues that these clients present. This necessitates expanding beyond the feminist-based peer-counselor model that most domestic violence agencies are founded upon and integrating a gender-inclusive clinical approach that addresses the relational dynamics of the abuse and underlying psychotherapeutic issues. WEAVE, Sacramento County's primary provider of domestic violence services, is successfully modifying its culture and programs to be more responsive to clients of both genders accessing services with various trauma histories. Adapted from the source document.

The Effects of Intimate Partner Violence on Relationship Satisfaction Over Time for Young At-Risk Couples: The Moderating Role of Observed Negative and Positive Affect

Author: Shortt, Joann Wu; Capaldi, Deborah M; Kim, Hyoun K; Laurent, Heidemarie K

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992599?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the current study, the moderating effects of observed negative and positive affects on the association between intimate partner violence (IPV, physical aggression) and relationship satisfaction were examined over a 5-year period. Multiwave data were obtained from a sample of young adult men at risk for delinquency and their women partners (n = 121 couples; ages 21-26 years). The trajectory of each partner's relationship satisfaction and the effects of dyadic IPV and affect were tested using HLM analyses and a two-level (within-couple and between-couple) dyadic growth model. Average levels of dyadic positive affect were associated with relationship satisfaction for both men and women. For men, increases in couples' positive affect over time were linked to increases in relationship satisfaction, and increases in couples' externalizing negative affect were linked to decreases in satisfaction. For women, higher levels of couples' IPV predicted lower levels of satisfaction. Couples' internalizing negative affect amplified the effects of IPV on satisfaction over time. Increases in IPV were associated with declines in satisfaction for couples with high levels of internalizing negative affect. Conversely, average levels of externalizing negative affect did not amplify the association between IPV and relationship satisfaction. In fact, the adverse influence of IPV on relationship satisfaction was greater for couples who displayed low levels of externalizing negative affect. Because of the inverse association between externalizing negative affect and relationship satisfaction, these findings were interpreted to suggest that the salience of IPV was greater in couples whose relationship satisfaction was not already impaired by high levels of negative affect. Adapted from the source document.

Policing Domestic Violence: The Significance of Charging in the Post-Arrest Decision Making of Police Officers

Author: Phillips, Scott W; Gillham, James

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753991827?accountid=14925

Abstract: During the 1980s many state legislatures enacted laws to address domestic violence cases, including mandatory arrest and warrantless arrest in a misdemeanor domestic violence incident. The domestic violence arrest decision has been extensively examined, but this is not the final decision point for officers. This research examined police officers' decisions when listing criminal charges in domestic violence incidents. Using a vignette research design, data come from 267 police officers in a large department. Most police officers listed the criminal charge that would be expected based on the conditions described in the vignette. Specific factors increased the likelihood of misdemeanor and felony level criminal charges being listed. Adapted from the source document.

Erring on the Side of Hidden Harm: The Granting of Domestic Violence Restraining Orders

Author: Heleniak, David N

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753991922?accountid=14925

Abstract: In deciding whether to enter a domestic violence restraining order, many judges think about their careers in addition to the merits of the cases before them. While the damage to parent-child relationships and to children's mental health caused by the overzealous entering of restraining orders is seldom if ever reported by the media, the harm caused by overtly violent acts following the failure to enter restraining orders most certainly is. In regards to restraining orders, the phrase 'erring on the side of caution' is often invoked. It is more accurate, however, to characterize the judge's behavior as 'erring on the side of hidden harm.' Rather than judges, juries-one time judicial actors-should decide when domestic violence restraining orders are warranted. Adapted from the source document.

The Peaceful Families Project: Addressing Domestic Violence in Muslim Communities

Author: Abugideiri, Salma

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753991681?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Peaceful Families Project (PFP) is a domestic violence prevention organization that was established in response to a critical need in the U.S. Muslim community, which has only begun to openly discuss and tackle issues related to domestic violence in the last 10 to 15 years. The organization utilizes education and training as the primary means of addressing domestic violence in Muslim communities. Although Muslims in the United States are a diverse population, they are united by certain common beliefs and values that can be utilized in domestic violence prevention. Educational materials and programs focus on highlighting teachings and values from within the Islamic paradigm to address attitudes and behaviors among Muslims that may contribute to the occurrence of abuse within the family. Technical assistance and trainings are also offered to mainstream service providers to increase their ability to deliver culturally sensitive and appropriate services to Muslim communities. By targeting individuals, families, Muslim leaders, and mainstream service providers, PFP seeks to create systemic change in an effort to make a real contribution toward ending domestic violence.

Perceptions of and Experience With System Responses to Female Same-Sex Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Alhusen, Jeanne L; Lucea, Marguerite B; Glass, Nancy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/820821018?accountid=14925

Abstract: Female same-sex intimate partner violence (FSSIPV) is a significant problem that affects the physical and mental health and the safety of sexual minority women. A mixed-methods study was conducted to (a) identify risk and protective factors for victimization and perpetration of repeat violence in abusive same-sex relationships and (b) examine participant experiences with system responses (by domestic violence services, criminal justice systems, and health care services) to FSSIPV. The purpose of the article is to report the findings from the qualitative component (e.g., focus groups and individual interviews) of the parent study that are specific to survivors' perceptions of and experiences with domestic violence services, criminal justice systems, and health care services. The findings indicate a significant need across all systems for increased awareness, enhanced understanding, and provision of services specific to survivors of FSSIPV. Adapted from the source document.

Stop Abuse for Everyone: Interviews With Founders of a Pioneering Anti-Domestic Violence Nonprofit

Author: Turteltaub, Jack

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/820821020?accountid=14925

Abstract: History and overview of Stop Abuse for Everyone (SAFE), a nonprofit developed in the 1990s initially to help males and other underserved victims of domestic violence. The article describes the original founder's experience as a nonabusive male in a marriage with a violent female spouse and his recognition that his marriage did not fit ideological feminist theories or the Duluth model treatment approach to domestic violence, both of which emphasize male culpability for violence in intimate relationships. The article discusses the creation of a Web site and then the formation of the nonprofit. Four founders of SAFE are interviewed, and SAFE's brochure program, speakers bureau, and state chapters are discussed. SAFE's contribution to the national debate about the role of gender in domestic violence, involvement in the revision of the Violence Against Women Act, and efforts to develop a more nuanced, dynamic model of domestic violence in the context of various gender/sexual orientation configurations are reviewed. Adapted from the source document.

Learning in the Real World: Coeducational Groups in Response to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Hexham, Craig

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/820821015?accountid=14925

Abstract: Among a number of recommendations and standards related to interventions for perpetrators of intimate partner violence is a clear implication that male and female offenders should receive gender specific services. Such segregation often assumes a potential danger to or exacerbation of victimization for the women or else identifies such distinct etiologies for violent behaviors that the treatment needs must be equally disparate. Described herein is a program that provides services for men and women in the same setting. Supporting this intervention is the belief that a significant number of those referred experience similar motivation for their thoughts, feelings, and actions and that therapeutic response will be correspondingly similar. Further, because people live, work, and play in mixed settings, it is more realistic and, it is hoped, more therapeutic to consider-and practice-changes in mixed settings as well. Pertinent factors in conducting these groups are presented, as are one presenter's perspective on advantages and disadvantages of such a structure. Finally, considerations for research are offered.

The effects of intimate partner violence on health in young adulthood in the United States

Author: Fletcher, Jason

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61354029?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper uses data on a national sample of adolescents from the United States followed through the transition into young adulthood to examine the association between intimate partner violence (IPV) and health outcomes, including depressive symptoms, self reported health status, and health care utilization. Researchers have shown an important IPV-health link in a number of settings but have often been limited by using cross-sectional data, convenience samples, and the inability to control for important risk factors and confounders. The findings from this study suggests that these limitations likely inflate the estimated link between IPV and health by as much as 60% but also show that IPV has important health impacts on a number of outcomes. The results also show no differential impact of IPV by gender or previous exposure to child abuse. The health effects of IPV are also typically larger for current exposure than previous exposure, but each exposure type is shown to reduce health. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

Do changes in spousal employment status lead to domestic violence? Insights from a prospective study in Bangalore, India

Author: Krishnan, Suneeta; Rocca, Corinne H; Hubbard, Alan E; Subbiah, Kalyani; Edmeades, Jeffrey; Padian, Nancy S

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61355442?accountid=14925

Abstract: The prevalence of physical domestic violence - violence against women perpetrated by husbands - is staggeringly high across the Indian subcontinent. Although gender-based power dynamics are thought to underlie women's vulnerability, relatively little is known about risk and protective factors. This prospective study in southern India examined the association between key economic aspects of gender-based power, namely spousal employment status, and physical domestic violence. In 2005-2006, 744 married women, aged 16-25, residing in low-income communities in Bangalore, India were enrolled in the study. Data were collected at enrollment, 12 and 24 months. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the prospective association between women's employment status, their perceptions of their husband's employment stability, and domestic violence. Women who were unemployed at one visit and began employment by the next visit had an 80% higher odds of violence, as compared to women who maintained their unemployed status. Similarly, women whose husbands had stable employment at one visit and newly had difficulty with employment had 1.7 times the odds of violence, as compared to women whose husbands maintained their stable employment. To our knowledge, this study is the first from a developing country to confirm that changes in spousal employment status are associated with subsequent changes in violence risk. It points to the complex challenges of violence prevention, including the need for interventions among men and gender- transformative approaches to promote gender-equitable attitudes, practices and norms among men and women.

The role of the extended family in women's risk of intimate partner violence in Jordan

Author: Clark, Cari Jo; Silverman, Jay G; Shahrouri, Manal; Everson-Rose, Susan; Groce, Nora

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60340820?accountid=14925

Abstract: The extended family as a potential cause of and protection against intimate partner violence (IPV) remains relatively unstudied. This mixed- methods study used focus group discussions (FGDs) and a clinic-based survey to investigate several family-based risk and protective factors associated with women's risk of IPV in Jordan. Seventeen FGDs (total number of participants = 105) were conducted with women in Amman. Each transcript was coded for categories using open coding methodology and mapping. Relevant categories and subcategories were family support, family interference, family abuse, exposure to violence in childhood, and place of residence. For the survey, systematic probability proportionate to size methodology was used to select a sample of 517 literate, ever married, women from seven reproductive health clinics located throughout the country (response rate = <=70%); due to missing data, the analytic sample was restricted to 418 women. Measures assessed the categories mentioned above. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to examine the relationship between IPV and the main predictors of interest (residence, family interference, family violence, exposure to violence as a child, and family support). The combined results of the FGDs and the survey demonstrated that the respondent's husband's exposure to violence in childhood and violence perpetrated by other family members were risk factors for IPV. Family interference was also significantly related to IPV but only when the respondent identified the interference as harmful to her relationship. Residence with the respondent's in-laws demonstrated mixed effects. A supportive family was protective against IPV, although the FGDs revealed that families were not always an effective source of assistance. Findings demonstrate the continued role of the wife's and husband's kin in women's risk of IPV in Jordan, highlighting the importance of a broader view of the context of IPV.

The risk of return: Intimate partner violence in Northern Uganda's armed conflict

Author: Annan, Jeannie; Brier, Moriah

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60331877?accountid=14925

Abstract: The physical and psychological consequences of armed conflict and intimate partner violence are well documented. Less research focuses on their intersection and the linkages between domestic violence, gender-based discrimination, and the structural violence of poverty in armed conflict. This paper describes emerging themes from qualitative interviews with young women who have returned from abduction into the Lord's Resistance Army in northern Uganda, many of whom were forcibly given as "wives" to commanders. Their interviews reveal multiple levels of violence that some women experience in war, including physical and sexual violence in an armed group, verbal and physical abuse from extended family members, and intimate partner violence. Striking is the violence they describe after escaping from the rebels, when they are back with their families. The interviews point to how abduction into the armed group may exacerbate problems but highlight the structural factors that permit and sustain intimate partner violence, including gender inequalities, corruption in the police system, and devastating poverty. Findings suggest that decreasing household violence will depend on the strength of interventions to address all levels, including increasing educational and economic opportunities, increasing accountability of the criminal justice system, minimizing substance abuse, and improving the coping mechanisms of families and individuals exposed to extreme violence.

Responses to intimate partner violence in Kakuma refugee camp: Refugee interactions with agency systems

Author: Horn, Rebecca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61378744?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been recognised as a significant problem amongst forcibly displaced communities, and great progress has been made by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in responding to IPV and other forms of sexual and gender based violence. However, they have not always effectively engaged refugee communities in these activities, with potentially negative consequences for the health and protection of women. This study was conducted in Kakuma refugee camp, north-west Kenya. Eighteen focus group discussions were conducted with 157 refugees from various nationalities, including Sudanese, Somali, Ethiopian, and Congolese. They focused on the nature and consequences of IPV in Kakuma. The aim of this paper is to explore how refugees in Kakuma talk about the ways that IPV is dealt with, focusing particularly on the ways that community responses are said to interact with formal response systems established by UNHCR and its implementing partners. Refugees talked about using a 'hierarchy of responses' to IPV, with only particularly serious or intransigent cases reaching UNHCR or its implementing agencies. Some male refugees described being mistrustful of agency responses, because agencies were believed to favour women and to prioritise protecting the woman at all costs, even if that means separating her from the family. Whilst community responses to IPV might often be appropriate and helpful, the findings of the current study suggest that in Kakuma they do not necessarily result in the protection of women. Yet women in Kakuma are reported to be reluctant to report their cases to UNHCR and its implementing agencies. A more effective protection response from UNHCR might involve closer co-operation with individuals and structures within the refugee communities to develop a co-ordinated response to IPV.

Intimate Partner Violence Against Aboriginal Men in Canada

Author: Brownridge, Douglas A11 University of Manitoba, Canada Douglas_Brownridge@umanitoba.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/764427005?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using a large-scale representative sample of Canada collected in 1999, this study examined Aboriginal men's elevated risk for violent victimisation relative to non-Aboriginal men. Aboriginal men reported about 2.5 to 3.5 times the risk of intimate partner violence victimisation compared to non-Aboriginal men. Aboriginal men's elevated risk of violence was greatest on some of the most severe forms of violence and appeared to be due to their relatively higher levels of unemployment and relatively younger average age. While future research is needed to disentangle the complex interplay of colonisation and risk factors for understanding Aboriginal peoples' elevated risk of intimate partner violence victimisation, the current study demonstrates that gender is also worthy of consideration.

Building and Sustaining Local Co-ordination: An Australian Rural Community Responds to Domestic and Family Violence

Author: Wendt, Sarah

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61377512?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to share a story about how a rural community in South Australia strived to work more collaboratively and effectively to respond to domestic and family violence in their local area. Human service workers in the community raised concern about clients' needs not being met, lack of co-ordination amongst services, confusion amongst service providers of who was doing what, and lack of understanding of the complexities of violence and abuse amongst workers. As a result, a qualitative, interpretative study involving face-to-face semi-structured interviews with twenty-two human service workers and two women who had experienced domestic and family violence was undertaken to examine the barriers to working collaboratively at the local level. Once barriers to co-ordination were identified and talked about, workers were able to visualize their local response. This included naming practice strategies to build co-ordination and integration of workers and agencies to create sustainable long-term practice, and advocating as a community for the re-introduction of domestic violence specialized services and programmes to meet local needs. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence in Bulgaria -- Parameters, Prerequisites Trends of Social Work

Author: Ganeva, Vanya

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/852900549?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article presents an analysis of the domestic violence structure in Bulgaria and the system of mechanisms for preventing violence. Based on the outcomes of sociological research are explained: the spread of domestic violence; its main forms; the reasons for it; social attitudes regarding the need of providing professional assistance to the victims and searching for punitive responsibility for the doers of violence. A conclusion is reached that what is needed in Bulgaria at the beginning of the 21st century is legislative protection in cases of domestic violence as well as social work focused on both eliminating the causes giving rise to family violence and restricting and doing away with its consequences. The article draws the positive trends in social work against domestic violence in Bulgaria, the functions and authorities of institutions involved in this problem. Adapted from the source document.

Does the Inclusion Criterion of Women's Aggression as Opposed to Their Victimization Result in Samples That Differ on Key Dimensions of Intimate Partner Violence?

Author: Sullivan, Tami P1; Titus, Jennifer A; Holt, Laura J; Swan, Suzanne C; Fisher, Bonnie S; Snow, David L1 Yale U School Medicine, New Haven, CT tami.sullivan@yale.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61377901?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study is among the first attempts to address a frequently articulated, yet unsubstantiated claim that sample inclusion criteria based on women's physical aggression or victimization will yield different distributions of severity and type of partner violence and injury. Independent samples of African American women participated in separate studies based on either inclusion criterion of women's physical aggression or victimization. Between-groups comparisons showed that samples did not differ in physical, sexual, or psychological aggression; physical, sexual, or psychological victimization; inflicted or sustained injury. Therefore, inclusion criterion based on physical aggression or victimization did not yield unique samples of 'aggressors' and 'victims.'.

Complex Behavioral Patterns and Trajectories of Domestic Violence Offenders

Author: Jones, Alison Snow; Heckert, D Alex; Gondolf, Edward D; Zhang, Qiang; Ip, Edward H

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612316?accountid=14925

Abstract: Evidence-based practice within the criminal justice system has relied primarily on cumulative reports of reassaults or rearrests, especially in evaluating effectiveness of domestic violence (DV) interventions. We use a longitudinal sample of DV offenders arrested and referred to DV offender programs in four cities to examine complex multi-outcome patterns of violent and abusive behavior and trajectories between patterns over time. Offenders and their partners were surveyed at program intake and followed for 15 months (N = 550). A Hidden Markov Model identifies four distinct behavioral patterns. Trajectory analysis indicates that the most abusive state is relatively stable and indicative of a high probability of future physical assault. Results suggest that evaluation based on complex outcomes may improve criminal justice intervention effectiveness, risk assessment, and risk management. Adapted from the source document.

The Coping Window: A Contextual Understanding of the Methods Women Use to Cope With Battering

Author: Smith, Paige Hall; Murray, Christine E; Coker, Ann L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741610511?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study aimed to develop a conceptual framework for understanding the coping strategies used by women who are battered, drawing from the existing literature and qualitative interviews with 10 women seeking services in shelters for women who have been battered. This conceptual framework is needed to reflect the unique complexity of the nature of the chronic and acute stressors associated with battering. The results of the data analyses were integrated with the existing literature to form a model, The Coping Window. This model includes an external frame of contextual influences, as well as a Focus Axis (including emotion-focused and problem-focused coping strategies) and a Resource Axis (including intrapersonal and interpersonal coping strategies). The Coping Window model could be used in individual or group counseling and educational programs, and additional research is needed to refine this model. Adapted from the source document.

Patterns of Intimate Partner Violence and Associated Risk Factors Among Married Enlisted Female Soldiers

Author: Forgey, Mary Ann; Badger, Lee

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741613055?accountid=14925

Abstract: A sample of 248 enlisted active duty females married to civilian spouses completed a self-report survey that asked about their own and their spouse's violence. The survey also asked about their sex-role attitudes, marital satisfaction, alcohol use, childhood trauma, and depression. Results identified patterns of intimate partner violence and their relationship to the psychosocial risk factors. Females experiencing severe bidirectional violence were likely to be the most depressed and to have a history of child sexual abuse. Females experiencing minor bidirectional violence did not share any of the psychosocial risk factors found for severe bidirectional violence. Females perpetrating unilateral violence toward their spouses were found to be as satisfied in their marriages as nonviolent couples and less depressed than the females experiencing bidirectional violence.

Variation in Late Adolescents' Reports of Dating Violence Perpetration: A Dyadic Analysis

Author: Schnurr, Melissa P; Lohman, Brenda J; Kaura, Shelby A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612131?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study begins to fill the methodological gap in the dating violence literature by using hierarchical linear modeling to: (a) examine whether partners agree on reports of their experiences with violence in their relationship; and (b) identify factors that may explain differences in these reports. Data from the Relationship Dimensions Survey, a survey given to 214 late adolescent dating couples were utilized. Results indicated that there was significant variation in the report of dating violence perpetration and in the gender effect across couples, but not within couples. These differences were explained by individual- and relationship-related characteristics, including physical abuse from a parent during childhood, and for males' perpetration only, whether they drank alcohol. Implications for violence prevention are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Prevalence and Determinants of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Kazeroon, Islamic Republic of Iran

Author: Vakili, Mahmood; Nadrian, Haidar; Fathipoor, Mohammad; Boniadi, Fatemeh; Morowatisharifabad, Mohammad Ali

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612262?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this study was to screen for and estimate the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) among women in Kazeroon, Iran. In November 2007, multistage cluster sampling was employed to recruit 702 women to participate in the study. A descriptive, cross-sectional design was employed. The prevalence of physical, psychological, and sexual abuse against women was 43.7%, 82.6%, and 30.9%, respectively, and there was a significant relationship between IPV and family income, education level, and level of religious commitment in both women and husbands. The study suggests that major strategies for prevention of IPV are empowering women and improving their status in the society by promoting of sexual equality in all rights, especially in employment and education.

Childhood Predictors of Teen Dating Violence Victimization

Author: Maas, Carl D; Fleming, Charles B; Herrenkohl, Todd I; Catalano, Richard F

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741609573?accountid=14925

Abstract: Most research on predictors of teen dating violence (TDV) has used cross-sectional data, which weakens predictive modeling and hypothesis testing analyses. This study uses prospective and retrospective longitudinal data on a community sample to examine previously identified predictors of TDV victimization and pathways from childhood risk and protection to TDV victimization. Data are from 941 participants in the Raising Healthy Children project. For girls, a multivariate path model indicated that higher levels of bonding to parents and social skills protected against TDV victimizations, partly by reducing early adolescent alcohol use. For boys, there was an indirect path from childhood bonding to parents to TDV victimization through early adolescent externalizing behavior. Adapted from the source document.

Assessing Resilience in Preschool Children Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Howell, Kathryn H; Graham-Bermann, Sandra A; Czyz, Ewa; Lilly, Michelle

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743058940?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined why some preschool-age children exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) showed deleterious outcomes and others appeared more resilient. Resilience, conceptualized as strengths in emotion regulation and prosocial skills, was evaluated using the Social Competence Scale developed by the Conduct Problem Prevention Research Group. The sample consisted of 56 mothers and their 4- to 6-year-old children exposed to IPV within the past 2 years. After controlling for relevant demographic factors, hierarchical regression analyses indicated that better parenting performance, fewer maternal mental health problems, and less severe violence exposure predicted better emotion regulation and prosocial skill scores, which in turn were negatively correlated with maladaptive child behaviors. These findings can be used to inform and enhance clinical services for children exposed to IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Children's Exposure to Intimate Partner Violence: Relations Between Parent-Child Concordance and Children's Adjustment

Author: Hungerford, Anne; Ogle, Richard L; Clements, Caroline M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741613331?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study examined the extent to which seventy-five 5- to 13-year-old children and their mothers agreed about whether children had been exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) and the association between parent-child agreement and children's psychological adjustment. One type of disagreement (i.e., parents failed to report IPV exposure that children reported) was associated with children's perceptions of less positive family relationships. Parents of these children, however, reported fewer child adjustment problems than did parents who agreed with their children about children's IPV exposure. The findings suggest the importance of obtaining children's reports of their own exposure to IPV in addition to parental reports. Moreover, parent-child concordance with respect to children's IPV exposure may be an important variable to examine in understanding variations in children's adjustment.

Factors That Affect Women's Attitudes Toward Domestic Violence in Turkey

Author: Marshall, Gul Aldikacti; Furr, L Allen

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743058200?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the attitudes of Turkish women toward justification of intimate partner violence. The data were gathered from the 2003 Turkey Demographic and Health Survey. A random sample of 8,075, aged 15-49, participated in the survey. The findings underline the importance of patriarchal beliefs and the associated practice of brides-money in addition to rural residence, large household, illiteracy, lack of wealth, and younger age at marriage as the sources of acceptance of violence among women. The study provides a theoretical explanation for how patriarchal ideology is translated into an accepting attitude toward violence and also discusses the factors that serve as mechanisms that help women resist patriarchal hegemony and not justify domestic violence against women. The final section of the article addresses policy implications. Adapted from the source document.

Measurement and Correlates of Intimate Partner Violence Among Expectant First-Time Parents

Author: Kan, Marni L; Feinberg, Mark E

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743062720?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on the implications of varying measurement strategies for estimating levels and correlates of intimate partner violence (IPV) has been limited. This study explored measurement and correlates of IPV using a community sample of 168 couples who were expecting their first child. In line with prior research, couple agreement regarding the presence of violence was low, and maximum reported estimates revealed substantial IPV perpetrated by both expectant mothers and fathers. Different types of IPV scores predicted unique variance in mental health problems and couple relationship distress among both the whole sample and the subsamples who perpetrated any violence. Discussion focuses on the methodological and substantive implications of these findings for the study of IPV during the transition to parenthood. Adapted from the source document.

Effects of Early Exposure and Lifetime Exposure to Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) on Child Adjustment

Author: Graham-Bermann, Sandra A; Perkins, Suzanne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992271?accountid=14925

Abstract: Children exposed to overwhelming and potentially traumatic events early in their lives are considered at-risk for problems in adjustment. Yet it is not known whether it is the age of first exposure (AFE) to violence or the amount of violence that the child witnessed in their lifetime that has the greatest impact on adjustment. For a sample of 190 children ages 6 to 12 exposed to intimate partner violence, their mothers reported that the average length of their abusive relationship was 10 years. The majority of children were first exposed to family violence as infants (64%), with only 12% first exposed when school-aged. Both the AFE and an estimate of the cumulative amount of violence were significantly and negatively related to children's behavioral problems. However, in regression analyses controlling for child sex, ethnicity, age, and family environment variables, cumulative violence exposure accounted for greater variance in adjustment than did AFE. Furthermore, cumulative violence exposure mediated the relationship between AFE and externalizing behavior problems, indicating that the cumulative exposure to IPV outweighed the AFE in its effect on child adjustment. Adapted from the source document.

External Barriers to Help-Seeking Encountered by Canadian Gay and Lesbian Victims of Intimate Partner Abuse: An Application of The Barriers Model

Author: St Pierre, Melissa; Senn, Charlene Y

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/754038386?accountid=14925

Abstract: While understanding of intimate partner abuse (IPA) in gay and lesbian relationships has increased within the past decade, there remain several gaps in the help-seeking research. In particular, research examining the external barriers to help-seeking encountered by gay and lesbian victims of IPA has been largely atheoretical. To address this gap, an application of The Barriers Model was undertaken. This mixed-methods study surveyed 280 gay, lesbian, and/or queer participants living in Canada. Findings revealed that victims encountered external barriers in the environment (i.e., Layer 1 of the model), such as lack of availability of gay and lesbian specific services. Results also suggested that barriers due to family/socialization/role expectations (i.e., Layer 2 of the model), such as concealment of sexual orientation, had an impact on help-seeking. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Hurricane Katrina: Predictors and Associated Mental Health Outcomes

Author: Schumacher, Julie A; Coffey, Scott F; Norris, Fran H; Tracy, Melissa; Clements, Kahni; Galea, Sandro

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758127641?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study sought to establish the prevalence and correlates of intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization in the 6 months before and after Hurricane Katrina. Participants were 445 married or cohabiting persons who were living in the 23 southernmost counties of Mississippi at the time of Hurricane Katrina. Data for this study were collected as part of a larger, population-based, representative study. The percentage of women reporting psychological victimization increased from 33.6% prior to Hurricane Katrina to 45.2% following Hurricane Katrina (p < .001). The percentage of men reporting psychological victimization increased from 36.7% to 43.1% (p = .01). Reports of physical victimization increased from 4.2% to 8.3% for women (p = .01) but were unchanged for men. Significant predictors of post-Katrina victimization included pre-Katrina victimization, age, educational attainment, marital status, and hurricane-related stressors. Reports of IPV were associated with greater risk of post-Katrina depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. Data from the first population-based study to document IPV following a large-scale natural disaster suggest that IPV may be an important but often overlooked public health concern following disasters. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and PTSD: The Moderating Role of Emotion-Focused Coping

Author: Lilly, Michelle M; Graham-Bermann, Sandra A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758129793?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects millions of women every year, often resulting in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The strength of the relationship between IPV and PTSD has been shown to be affected by factors such as the amount of violence exposure and the style of coping in which the individual engages. For example, emotion-focused coping has been shown to be strongly related to IPV exposure and the expression of PTSD symptoms. This topic was explored in IPV survivors, with the finding that more frequent use of emotion-focused coping was associated with both higher violence exposure and heightened PTSD symptoms. Regression analyses revealed that emotion-focused coping moderated the relationship between IPV exposure and PTSD symptoms. More specifically, the results suggest that while individuals low on emotion-focused coping had fewer PTSD symptoms than women who frequently used emotion-focused coping, these individuals reported higher PTSD symptoms in the presence of frequent violence exposure. For individuals who frequently engaged in emotion-focused coping, violence exposure was less strongly associated with symptoms of PTSD. Adapted from the source document.

Health Care Providers' Readiness to Screen for Intimate Partner Violence in Northern Nigeria

Author: John, I A; Lawoko, Stephen; Svanstrom, L; Mohammed, A Z

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758123713?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on screening for intimate partner violence (IPV) within health care in a sub-Saharan African context is rare. This paper assessed factors associated with the readiness to screen for IPV among care providers (HCP, n = 274) at Kano hospital, Nigeria. Readiness was measured using the Domestic Violence Health Care Providers' survey instrument, which measures grade of perceived self-efficacy in screening for IPV, fear for victim/provider safety, access to system support to refer IPV victims, professional roles resistant/fear of offending clients, and blaming the victim for being abused victim. Social workers perceived a higher self-efficacy and better access to system support networks to refer victims than peers in other occupation categories. Female care providers and doctors were less likely to blame the victim than males and social workers, respectively. Younger care providers of Yoruba ethnicity and social workers were less likely to perceive conflicting professional roles related to screening than older providers of Hausa ethnicity and doctors, respectively. Implications of our findings for interventions and further research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

The Impact of Childhood Sexual Abuse and Intimate Partner Violence on Sexually Transmitted Infections

Author: Williams, Corrine; Larsen, Ulla; McCloskey, Laura Ann

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/853218120?accountid=14925

Abstract: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and adult intimate partner violence (IPV) have both been found to be associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) independently, but studies of STIs have rarely looked at victimization during both childhood and adulthood. This paper examines the relationship between CSA, IPV and STIs using data from a nested case control study of 309 women recruited from multiple health care settings. Overall, 37.3% of women experienced no violence, 10.3% experienced CSA only, 27.3% experienced IPV only, and 25.0% experienced both CSA and IPV. Having ever been diagnosed with an STI was associated with violence (CSA only, odds ratios [OR] = 2.8, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.0-7.5; IPV only, OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.0-4.9; CSA and IPV: OR = 4.0, 95% CI = 1.7-9.4), controlling for demographic characteristics. Women who experienced CSA were younger when they were first diagnosed. Understanding how both childhood and adult victimization are associated with diagnosis of STIs is important to reducing the incidence and prevalence of STIs, as well as the associated consequences of STIs. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and South Korean Women: The Cultural Context and Alternative Experiences

Author: Kim, Bitna; Titterington, Victoria B; Kim, Yeonghee; Wells, William Bill

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/853218092?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present research contributes to the growing body of cross-cultural research on domestic violence. This is accomplished by answering the question of how severity of intimate partner abuse varies for (1) women incarcerated for the homicides of their male partners (2) abused women who sought domestic violence shelter, short of killing their intimate assailants, and (3) a group of South Korean females outside of domestic violence shelters or prison. The article concludes with a discussion of potential policy implications of the findings as well as promising directions for future research. Adapted from the source document.

Mores and gains: The EU's influence on domestic violence policies among its new post-communist member states

Author: Fabian, Katalin11 Lafayette College, Department of Government and Law, 103 Kirby Hall, Easton, PA 18042, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60384662?accountid=14925

Abstract: Synopsis The EU indirectly affects its member states' social policy, and there is a long-standing debate about its direct causal effect on member states regarding non-economic matters. This article analyzes how the governments of new post-communist Central and Eastern European EU members and candidates reacted to pressures from the European Commission, while acknowledging that the broader context of other global, regional, and domestic actors also affects the establishment of new laws and norms related to domestic violence. The EU's influence is controversial and manifold in post-communist Central and East Europe: while it has rhetorically endorsed gender equality, it has only recently and selectively started to pressure members and candidates into implementing changes and monitoring progress.

Women's abuse of their children in the context on domestic violence: Reflection from women's accounts

Author: Damant, Dominique1; Lapierre, Simon; Lebosse, Catherine; Thibault, Sylvie; Lessard, Genevieve; Hamelin-Brabant, Louise; Lavergne, Chantal; Fortin, Andree1 Universite de Montreal, succursale Centre-ville, Montreal e-mail:dominique.damant@umontreal.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61362834?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper draws upon the findings of a study that looked at women's experiences of mothering in the context of co-occurrence of domestic violence and child abuse, and considers the issue of women's violence towards children -- while acknowledging the fact that men are the main perpetrators of violence towards women and children in these families. The paper first explores the relationship between women's victimization and women's violence, and suggests that women's abuse of their children can be seen as a consequence of their own experiences of domestic violence. The findings nonetheless suggest that abused women have agency, and therefore have responsibilities when they chose to use violence towards their children.

Examining Symmetry in Intimate Partner Violence Among Young Adults Using Socio-Demographic Characteristics

Abstract: Over the past few decades, research on symmetry in intimate partner violence (IPV) has continued to yield mixed results. This article examines symmetry in the prevalence of four types of IPV perpetration and victimization based on socio-demographic characteristics of gender, race, relationship status, sexual orientation, age, and socioeconomic status. Socio-demographic characteristics are examined individually and in combination based on subgroups of unidirectional (perpetration-only and victimization-only) and bidirectional IPV using a nationally representative sample of young adults. Results indicate nearly 40% of the study sample reported at least one act of intimate partner violence and the majority of relationships involved bidirectional violence. Study findings reveal a lack of symmetry on some types of IPV based on the individual and combined socio-demographic characteristics of age, race, and gender. Overall findings show IPV to be prevalent in the relationships of young adults and implications for primary prevention programs are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Three Patterns of Domestic Violence in Households: Single Victimization, Repeat Victimization, and Co-occurring Victimization

Author: Goodlin, Wendi E1; Dunn, Christopher S1 School of Criminal Justice, The University of Southern Mississippi, 118 College Drive, Box #5127, Hattiesburg, MS, 39406, USA, Wendi.Goodlin@usm.edu

Abstract: Using National Crime Victimization Survey data (1992-2004), this study analyzed the effects of household variables, victim characteristics, and incident characteristics on three household family violence patterns (single victimization, repeat victimization and co-occurrence). Eighty percent of family violence households experienced one victimization; 15% experienced repeat victimization; 5% experienced co-occurrence. The total number of people in the household was positively related to multiple violent victimization households, especially co-occurrence households. Victims with less than a high school education (compared to victims with a high school education) had significantly higher odds of living in a co-occurrence household versus a repeat victimization household. Victims who experienced threatened attacks compared to completed attacks with no injury had higher odds of living in single victimization or repeat victimization households but had lower odds of living in co-occurrence households. Respondents victimized by ex-spouses, parents/stepparents, siblings, and other relatives had consistently higher odds of living in co-occurrence households versus repeat victimization households compared to those victimized by spouses.

Men's Self-Reported Descriptions and Precipitants of Domestic Violence Perpetration as Reported in Intake Evaluations

Author: Fenton, Becky1; Rathus, Jill H1 Psychology Department, Long Island University, C. W. Post Campus, Brookville, NY, USA, BFenton911@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810423786?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines descriptions and precipitants of domestic violence events, as reported by 24 males in intake interviews for a domestic violence treatment program. Six categories were derived for men's descriptions/explanations of violent incidents and 11 categories were derived for precipitants of violence. Men's accounts of their violent interactions reveal a wider range of descriptions than those often discussed in the literature, including direct acknowledgment and remorse. The most frequently reported precipitants were arguments regarding children/pets, violence of partner, alcohol use, overwhelming emotions, and arguments regarding jealousy; these were consistent with previously identified precipitants. Kappas indicated that rates of interrater agreement for descriptions and precipitants reached acceptable reliability. Results extend the widely-cited findings on men's self-appraisals of intimate partner violence and support past work on proximal factors that elicit violent partner responses. We propose a taxonomy of proximal antecedents of intimate partner violence to integrate present findings with previous research.

Examining an Extension of Johnson's Hypothesis: Is Male Perpetrated Intimate Partner Violence More Underreported than Female Violence?

Author: Emery, Clifton R11 George Warren Brown School of Social Work, Washington University, CB 1196, One Brookings Drive, Saint Louis, MO 63130, USA cemery@wustl.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741613385?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examines two hypotheses about under-reporting in intimate partner violence data. The first hypothesis holds that significant amounts of under-reporting of intimate partner violence occur due to stigma. The second examines the empirical evidence behind Johnson's (Journal of Marriage and the Family 57:238--294, 1995) contention that controversial findings of equal rates of intimate partner violence perpetration among men and women occur through a combination of heterogeneity in type of intimate partner violence and missing data. E.M. and Data Augmentation are used to correct for item non-response in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. Strong support is found for general under-reporting; weak support is found for greater under-reporting of male violence. Adapted from the source document.

Violent Acts and Injurious Consequences: An Examination of Competing Hypotheses About Intimate Partner Violence Using Agency-Based Data

Author: Warner, Tara D11 Department of Sociology, Bowling Green State University, 222 Williams Hall, Bowling Green, OH 43403, USA twarner@bgsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743061223?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study proposed and tested a series of competing hypotheses about intimate partner violence in the 2006 National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS), a dataset of criminal incidents known to the police. Three research questions were presented concerning gender differences in victim identity, victim-offender relationships, and victim injury with hypotheses derived from the feminist, family violence, and general violence perspectives. Victim-based analyses were consistent primarily with expectations of the feminist perspective, although aspects of the general violence perspective were supported as well: Women were more likely than men to experience violence from an intimate; they were more likely to experience violence from an intimate partner than from any other perpetrator; and when victimized by an intimate, women were usually more likely to be injured. These results highlight the uniqueness of violence between intimates relative to other types of violence. Adapted from the source document.

Controversies Involving Gender and Intimate Partner Violence in the United States

Author: Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Jennifer11 Psychology Department, University of South Alabama, 385 Life Sciences Building, Mobile, AL, 36688-0002, USA, jlr@usouthal.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809806917?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper summarizes five challenging ongoing controversies involving gender and U. S. intimate partner violence (IPV) (i.e., gender symmetry of perpetration; utility of typologies; understanding bi-directionally violent couples; violence motivations and self-defense, and treatment effectiveness). Reviewed evidence support three central theses that: 1) there are subtypes of IPV; 2) women are as involved as men with some but not all subtypes of IPV, and 3) recognition of these gender-related challenges will improve policy, treatment, and working models of IPV. Within this paper, a dyadic culture-family-attachment-skill deficit model of IPV is conceptualized and three types of bi-directionally violent couples are named and described (dyadic dominance, dyadic dysregulation, and dyadic couple violence). Practice and policy implications of these advances are articulated.

Gender and Intimate Partner Violence in the United States: Confronting the Controversies

Author: Ross, Jody M1; Babcock, Julia C1 Department of Psychology, Indiana University-Purdue University, Fort Wayne, 2101 E. Coliseum Blvd, Fort Wayne, IN 46805, USA rossj@ipfw.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743062068?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper comments on the Langhinrichsen-Rohling article (2010), which reviews five major controversies present in the field of partner violence research and in which the author describes a new typology of mutually-violent couples. Strengths of the original article are discussed, including the author's incorporation of existing data into a new typology, her focus on context in examining relationship violence, and her reasoned argument for studying the behavior of both male and female aggressors. Limitations associated with the scope and explicit predictions of Langhinrichsen-Rohling's new typology are also covered in this commentary. Finally, the need for improved treatments for partner violence is discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Langhinrichsen-Rolling's Confirmation of the Feminist Analysis of Intimate Partner Violence: Comment on 'Controversies Involving Gender and Intimate Partner Violence in the United States'

Author: Johnson, Michael P11 Sociology, Women's Studies, and African and African American Studies, Penn State, University Park, PA, USA mpj@psu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743063033?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article makes four major points in response to Jennifer Langhinrichsen-Rolling's (2010) review of the intimate partner violence literature. First, the evidence is clear that there is more than one type of intimate partner violence. Second, the feminists are right. Gender is central to the analysis of intimate partner violence, and the coercive controlling violence that most people associate with the term 'domestic violence' is perpetrated primarily by men against their female partners. Third, different types of intimate partner violence have different causes, different developmental trajectories, and different consequences. They require different models to understand them. Finally, we need more qualitative research focused on the least understood types of intimate partner violence: violent resistance and situational couple violence. Adapted from the source document.

Gendered and Social Hierarchies in Problem Representation and Policy Processes: 'Domestic Violence' in Finland and Scotland

Author: Hearn, Jeff1; McKie, Linda1 Linkoping U, Sweden hearn@hanken.fi

Abstract: This article identifies and critiques presumptions about gender and violence that continue to frame and inform the processes of policy formation and implementation on domestic violence. It also deconstructs the agendered nature of policy as gendered, multilevel individual and collective action. Drawing on comparative illustrative material from Finland and Scotland, we discuss how national policies and discourses emphasize physical forms of violence, place the onus on the agency of women, and encourage a narrow conceptualization of violence in relationships. The two countries do this in somewhat comparable, though different ways operating within distinct national gender contexts.The complex interweaving of masculinities, violence, and cultures, although recognized in many debates, is seemingly marginalized from dominant discourses, policy, and legal processes. Despite growth in critical studies on men, there is little attempt made to problematize the gendered nature of violence. Rather, policy and service outcomes reflect processes through which individualized and masculine discourses frame ideas, discourses, and policy work. Women experiencing violence are constructed as victims and potential survivors of violence, although the social and gendered hierarchies evident in policies and services result in longer-term inequities and suffering for women and their dependents.

'Keeping Up a Front': Narratives about Intimate Partner Violence, Pregnancy, and Antenatal Care

Author: Edin, Kerstin E1; Dahlgren, Lars; Lalos, Ann; Hogberg, Ulf1 Umea U, Sweden kerstin.edin@epiph.umu.se

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61350970?accountid=14925

Abstract: Nine women who had been subjected to severe intimate partner violence during pregnancy narrated their ambiguous and contradictory feelings and the various balancing strategies they used to overcome their complex and difficult situations. Because allowing anyone to come close posed a threat, the women mostly denied the situation and kept up a front to hide the violence from others. Three women disclosed ongoing violence to the midwives, but only one said such disclosure was helpful. This article highlights the complexity of being pregnant when living with an abusive partner and challenges antenatal care policies from the perspective of pregnant women.

Men's Gendered Constructions of Intimate Partner Violence as Predictors of Court-Mandated Batterer Treatment Drop Out

Author: Catlett, Beth S1; Toews, Michelle L; Walilko, Vanessa1 Program Women's and Gender Studies, DePaul University, 2320 N. Kenmore, 571 SAC, Chicago, IL 60614, USA bcatlett@depaul.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753991690?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to explore the meaning men make of their violence toward intimate partners and to examine if and how these meanings and constructions of violence predicted who drops out of batterer treatment prior to program completion. We used both qualitative and quantitative data collected from 154 men court-mandated to participate in a batterer intervention program. The qualitative findings indicated that the men in this sample minimized and denied responsibility for the violence they used towards their intimate partners while simultaneously rationalizing and justifying their violent behavior. Such findings provide insight into how denial and minimization and, more broadly, men's constructions of masculinity might predict their tendency to drop out of batterer treatment. Furthermore, building upon our qualitative findings, logistic regression analysis revealed that men who were lower income, no longer intimately involved with the women they abused, and who reported lower levels of physical violence and higher levels of hostility were more likely to drop out of the batterer treatment program.

Accounting for the hero: A critical psycho-discursive approach to children's experience of domestic violence and the construction of masculinities

Author: Dryden, Caroline1; Doherty, Kathy; Nicolson, Paula1 School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743053271?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article employs a critical psycho-discursive approach to social identity processes and subjectivity in an important and under-researched area; the psychological impact of domestic violence on children. We use a case study of interview interaction with two teenage brothers talking about their father's past violent behaviour to show that a highly idealised, dominant form of hegemonic masculinity - 'heroic protection discourse' (HPD) - was a major organising principle framing both brothers' understandings of events. However, significant differences occurred in how each boy identified and made sense of self and others within this discourse. We discuss our findings in terms of (1) the destructive power of HPD to position sons as responsible for a father's violent behaviour and (2) the utility of our approach for developing a better understanding of when, if or why psychological and behavioural problems associated with domestic violence are likely to develop in a particular child. In so doing, we hope to contribute to theoretical debates in social psychology on identity and subjectivity by showing how it is possible to make sense of the 'collision' between structure and agency through the study of social interaction.

No Recourse, No Support: State Policy and Practice towards South Asian Women Facing Domestic Violence in the UK super(1)

Author: Anitha, Sundari11 Dr Sundari Anitha is Research Fellow at the School of Politics and International Studies, University of Leeds. Her research interests lie in two areas: (i) issues of race/ethnicity, gender and working lives among the South Asian Diaspora in the UK; and (ii) social policy, health and criminal justice responses to violence against black and minority ethnic women in the UK. Over the last ten years, she has been active in campaigning and policy making on violence against women including forced marriage., s.anitha@leeds.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810721334?accountid=14925

Abstract: Summary This paper examines the extent to which government policy and practice meet the needs of women with insecure immigration status who are experiencing domestic violence. The research on which this paper is based was conducted between January and June 2007 and included qualitative interviews with thirty South Asian women who were barred from receiving public funds (known as 'no recourse to public funds' (NRPF)) due to their status as recent marriage migrants, who were living in the North West and Yorkshire regions of England. This paper examines the complex legislation that governs the entitlement of women with NRPF who are facing domestic violence, women's experiences of social service practice, its impact on the safety and welfare of the women and their children, and suggests a way forward.

Domestic violence assessments in the child advocacy center

Author: Thackeray, Jonathan D1; Scribano, Philip V; Rhoda, Dale1 Nationwide Children's Hospital, Center for Child and Family Advocacy, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, 655 East Livingston Avenue, Columbus, OH 43205, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60384819?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective This study was designed to identify the frequency, methods, and practices of universal assessments for domestic violence (DV) within child advocacy centers (CACs) and determine which factors are associated with CACs that conduct universal DV assessments. Methods The study design was a cross-sectional, web-based survey distributed to executive directors of National Children's Alliance accredited or accreditation-eligible CACs. Results Responses were received from 323 of 376 eligible CACs (86%). Twenty-nine percent of CAC directors report familiarity with current DV recommendations and 29% require annual education for staff regarding DV. Twenty-nine percent of CACs conduct 'universal assessments' (defined as a CAC that assesses female caregivers for DV more than 75% of the time). The majority of CACs use face-to-face interviews to conduct assessments, often with children, family or friends present. The presence of on-site DV resources (OR = 2.85, CI 1.25-6.50) and an annual DV educational requirement (OR = 2.88, CI 1.31-6.32) are associated with assessment of female caregivers. The presence of on-site DV resources (OR = 3.97, CI 2.21-7.14) is associated with universal assessments. Conclusions Many CAC directors are not aware of current DV recommendations and do not require annual DV training for staff. Less than one-third of CACs practice universal assessments and those that do often conduct DV assessments with methods and environments shown to be less comforting for the patient and less effective in victim identification. CACs are more likely to assess female caregivers if they have co-located DV resources and they require DV training of their staff. CACs are more likely to universally screen for DV if they have co-located DV resources. Practice implications The presence of DV in the home has significant potential to negatively impact a child's physical and mental health as well as the ability of the caregiver to adequately protect the child. Current practice in CACs suggests a knowledge gap in this area and this study identifies an opportunity to improve the services offered to these high-risk families. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

When child abuse overlaps with domestic violence: The factors that influence child protection workers' beliefs

Author: Postmus, Judy L1; Merritt, Darcey H1 Center on Violence Against Women & Children, Rutgers University, School of Social Work, United States

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61341688?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over the past decade, Child Protective Services (CPS) has been challenged with how to adequately respond to families experiencing domestic violence and whether exposure to domestic violence constitutes child abuse. Research provides a limited understanding of what factors (i.e. professional, personal, training) influence the beliefs of CPS workers but much more information is needed. The research described in this paper provides another opportunity to explore these factors that influence the beliefs and attitudes of 64 workers from a CPS system in a Midwestern state. Anonymous and confidential surveys queried respondents on demographic information, their beliefs about domestic violence and the intersection of domestic violence and child abuse, prior domestic violence training, and their professional and personal experiences with domestic violence. The results provide insight into challenges of addressing workers' beliefs about domestic violence and its overlap with child abuse and instill the need for more research to fully grasp how best to respond to families experiencing domestic violence.

Where's the peace in this movement? A domestic violence advocate's reflections on the movement

Author: Finley, Laura L11 Department of Sociology and Criminology, College of Arts and Sciences, Barry University, Miami Shores, FL, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743046945?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although the domestic violence movement has made great strides in its relatively short history, individualistic perspectives have hindered prevention attempts. Additionally, as the movement has become increasingly bureaucratized, it may be mirroring some of the dominator structures, methods and content found in other institutions. A personal reflection is presented regarding some concerns about the domestic violence movement and emphasizes the ways the movement could benefit from greater understanding of and collaboration with other peace and justice movements. Recommendations are included. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence Among the Black Poor: Intersectionality and Social Justice

Author: Conwill, William Louis11 University of Florida, Gainesville, FL wconwill@ufl.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758128177?accountid=14925

Abstract: There are striking gender, race, and class variations in rates of domestic violence. Some leading family theorists called for an intersectional analysis of how gender, race and class systems interact to improve domestic violence theory. This article improves domestic violence theory by: 1) using the discourse, or language, of intersectionality; 2) developing a metadisciplinary ecological model of the intersectionality of gender, race and class to investigate domestic violence in lower-class Black communities; and 3) listing implications for counselors that are derived from the perspectives of intersectionality and social justice. These implications are applicable throughout those regions where, historically, colonialist enterprises established racial hierarchies, with enslaved Africans at the bottom. Adapted from the source document.

Childhood Exposure to Domestic Violence and Attitude towards Wife Beating in Adult Life: A Study of Men in India

Author: Zhu, Ying1; Dalal, Koustuv1 Department of Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60360130?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined men's justification of wife beating in relation to their perceived rights and autonomy using a nationally representative sample of 18,047 men in India with childhood exposure to parental violence. Five reasons for wife beating justification, four items of men's perceived rights, and five items of household autonomy were analysed using X2 test and logistic regression. Among 18,047 participants, 67% justified wife beating. Low education, economic stress and being unmarried were generally more associated with justifying wife beating for all five reasons. Wife's refusal of sex and husband's final say on household autonomy are risk factors. Joint autonomy on household decision making and wife's autonomy on managing her own earnings are protective factors. Perceived relationship rights and autonomy are highly predictive of wife-beating justification for the men who have been exposed to parental violence during childhood. The study has significant implications for public health planners and education strategies. Adapted from the source document.

Perceptions of Domestic Violence in Lesbian Relationships: Stereotypes and Gender Role Expectations

Author: Little, Betsi1; Terrance, Cheryl1 Psychology Department, Trinity Lutheran College, Everett, Washington, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964192159?accountid=14925

Abstract: In light of evidence suggesting that violence between lesbian couples is oftentimes dismissed as 'mutually combative,' expectations that support this perception were examined. Participants (N = 287) evaluated a domestic violence situation within the context of a lesbian partnership. As physical appearance may be used to support gender- and heterosexist-based stereotypes relating to lesbians, participants evaluated a domestic violence incident wherein the physical appearance of both the victim and perpetrator were systematically varied. Overall, women perceived the situation as more dangerous than did men. However, among women, the plausibility of the victim's claim, and blame assigned to the perpetrator and victim, varied as a function of the physical appearance of the couple. Implications of this research as well as future directions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Does Powerlessness Explain the Relationship Between Intimate Partner Violence and Depression?

Author: Filson, Jennifer1; Ulloa, Emilio; Runfola, Cristin; Hokoda, Audrey1 San Diego State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60346174?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study aimed to test whether relationship power could act as a mediator of the relationship between intimate partner violence and depression. The proposed mediation model was based on the theory of gender and power and on previous research of intimate partner violence and depression. Survey results from a sample of 327 single undergraduate women lent support to the hypothesis stating that relationship power accounts for some of the association between intimate partner violence and depression. Results revealed that women who felt powerless had higher rates of intimate violence victimization and higher levels of depression; a mediation analysis revealed that sexual relationship power mediated the relationship between intimate partner violence and depression. Future interventions targeting the prevention of intimate partner violence among young women may want to utilize an empowerment approach to decrease their likelihood of experiencing dating violence victimization and their subsequent risk for depression.

Palestinian Physicians' Misconceptions About and Approval of Wife Abuse

Author: Haj-Yahia, Muhammad M11 Hebrew University of Jerusalem mshajyah@mscc.huji.ac.il

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61355462?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article presents the results of a study that examined Palestinian physicians' misconceptions about abused wives and abusive husbands and the extent to which Palestinian physicians approve of wife abuse. Self-administered questionnaires were completed by 396 physicians. The results revealed that between 10% and 49% of the Palestinian physicians held misconceptions about abused wives and between 15% and 63% held misconceptions about abusive husbands. The findings also revealed that substantial percentages of physicians tended to approve of moderate and severe violence against wives. Significant amounts of the variance in the physicians' approval of moderate and severe wife abuse can be attributed to their exposure to family violence and to their patriarchal ideology--variance over and above that which can be explained by the physicians' sociodemographic characteristics. The limitations of the study are discussed, as are the implications of the results for future research and theory development on the approaches of professionals toward wife abuse.

Through the Lens of Therapeutic Jurisprudence: The Relationship Between Empowerment in the Court System and Well-Being for Intimate Partner Violence Victims

Author: Cattaneo, Lauren Bennett1; Goodman, Lisa A1 George Mason University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60347198?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research has established the connection between intimate partner violence victims' empowering experiences in the court system and their satisfaction with the process, but not between these experiences and victims' broader wellbeing, a link suggested by the framework of therapeutic jurisprudence. This study investigated the relationship between empowerment and victim depression, quality of life, fear, and intention to use the system in the future among 142 court-involved women. At 3 and 6 months after recruitment, over and above repeat abuse, the outcome of the criminal case, and expectations about the court system, more empowering experiences in the court predicted improvement in depression and quality of life, in addition to stronger intention to use the system in the future if needed. Implications include the need for research on what aspects of victim experience in the court are empowering and evaluations of innovations that can increase the likelihood they will occur.

Marrying Contested Approaches: Empowerment and the Imposition of International Principles: Domestic Violence Case Resolution in Indonesia

Author: Venning, Philippa11 Australian Agency for International Development, Canberra, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743057953?accountid=14925

Abstract: Resolution of domestic violence disputes in Indonesia illustrates the contradictions between two international development trends - the increasing recognition of women's rights as human rights, and the emergence of empowerment approaches to community development. Despite the focus of legal empowerment programmes on increasing women's autonomy and finding creative solutions to legal problems, there is increasing pressure on women victims of violence to use the state criminal justice system to resolve domestic violence justified by international human rights principles. This pressure impedes empowerment programmes and fails to appreciate the capacity of local communities to apply and adapt international principles to their local context. Adapted from the source document.

Learning From Youth Exposed to Domestic Violence: Decentering DV and the Primacy of Gender Stereotypes

Author: Phillips, Beth1; Phillips, Debby A1 U.S. Peace Corps-Namibia/Uganda phillips.debby@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61360800?accountid=14925

Abstract: Up to 8 million American children witness domestic violence (DV) every year. Since this discovery in the mid-1980s, psychologists and social service professionals have conducted research with children exposed to DV. This ethnographic study expands on existing research by examining how youth exposed to DV perceive their experiences and staff interventions. Findings show they draw on gender stereotypes for behaviors, and these frequently resist DV education and the advocates' suggestions for coping. Findings also showed the staff's formal interventions with the youth contradict gender norms and their casual interactions with the youth often inadvertently reinforce stereotypical gender identities and behaviors.

Intimate Partner Violence and Consistent Condom Use Among Drug-Using Heterosexual Women in New York City

Author: Panchanadeswaran, Subadra1; Frye, Victoria; Nandi, Vijay; Galea, Sandro; Vlahov, David; Ompad, Danielle1 Adelphi University, School of Social Work, Garden City, New York, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743050980?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study examined the associations of relationship factors, partner violence, relationship power, and condom-use related factors with condom use with a main male partner among drug-using women. Over two visits, 244 heterosexual drug-using women completed a cross-sectional survey. Multivariate logistic regression models indicated that women who expected positive outcomes and perceived lower condom-use barriers were more likely to report condom use with their intimate partners. The findings suggest that future interventions aiming at reducing HIV risk among drug-using women should focus on women's subjective appraisals of risks based on key relationship factors in addition to the occurrence of partner violence. Adapted from the source document.

Six Months After Routine Screening for Intimate Partner Violence: Attitude Change, Useful and Adverse Effects

Author: Spangaro, J M1; Zwi, A B; Poulos, R G; Man, W Y N1 School of Public Health and Community Medicine, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743046908?accountid=14925

Abstract: This evaluative study measured self-reported changes in abuse-related measures six months after routine screening for intimate partner violence. Participants were 122 women who disclosed abuse and 241 who did not report abuse, screened in antenatal, substance abuse, and mental health services according to an existing standardized protocol used in New South Wales, Australia. Six months after initial screening, abused women were more likely to report increased agreement with a number of attitudes relating to abuse, in particular that being hurt by a partner affects a woman's health and that health services should ask about abuse. The proportion reporting current abuse was significantly lower after six months. While 6% (7/119) reported negative emotional reactions, 34% (41/120) reported useful effects--most frequently re-evaluating their situation and reducing isolation. Women who had experienced abuse, but elected not to disclose it reported similar effects. The results of this study lend support to the use of protocols for asking about abuse and responding to disclosures of abuse. Adapted from the source document.

HIV Sexual Risk Behavior Among Low-Income Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence: The Role of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

Author: Cavanaugh, Courtenay E1; Hansen, Nathan B; Sullivan, Tami P1 Department of Mental Health, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, 2213 McElderry Street, 4th Floor, M409, Baltimore, MD, 21205, USA, cocavana@jhsph.edu

Abstract: Posttraumatic stress disorder resulting from intimate partner violence (IPV-related PTSD), drug problems, and alcohol problems were tested as correlates of women's sexual risk behavior. Participants were 136 low-income women experiencing physical violence by a male partner during the past 6months. Sexual risk behavior was assessed by whether women had unprotected sex with a risky primary partner (i.e., HIV-positive, injection drug user, and/or nonmonogamous), unprotected sex with a risky nonprimary partner (i.e. HIV-positive or unknown status), or traded sex during the past 6months. Nearly one in five women engaged in these recent sexual risk behaviors. Simultaneous logistic regression results revealed IPV-related PTSD, but not drug or alcohol problems, was significantly associated with sexual risk behavior while controlling for childhood abuse and demographic covariates. Women with IPV-related PTSD had four times greater odds of recent sexual risk behavior compared to women without IPV-related PTSD. Implications for HIV prevention interventions are discussed.

The impact of childhood abuse history and domestic violence on the mental health of women in Japan

Author: Fujiwara, Takeo1; Okuyama, Makiko; Izumi, Mayuko; Osada, Yukiko1 Department of Health Promotion, National Institute of Public Health, Wako-shi, Saitama, Japan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743045537?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: To understand the independent and interactive effects of childhood abuse history (CAH) and domestic violence (DV) on the mental health status of women in Japan. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted among a sample of 340 women staying in 83 Mother-Child Homes in Japan to assess the women's CAH and DV experiences, along with their current mental health problems, including dissociated, depressed, and traumatic symptoms. Results: Independent from DV, CAH, especially psychological abuse, had a significant impact on all of the women's mental health symptoms. DV was found to have an independent effect on traumatic symptoms. Weak interactive effects of CAH and DV were found on dissociated and traumatic symptoms. Among those women without CAH, DV was significantly associated with dissociated and traumatic symptoms; however, DV had no impact on dissociated and traumatic symptoms if CAH was present. Conclusions The findings suggest the significant impact of CAH on women's mental health problems, independent from DV. CAH and DV weakly interact on women's mental health. Practice implications In psychological therapy for battered women with mental health problems, if the cases were abused during childhood, it is recommended that therapy be focused on childhood abuse, especially if the client was psychologically abused. In addition, mental health care and welfare providers should be aware that the mental health problems of mothers without CAH might be exacerbated by DV; thus, appropriate resource allocation should be considered.

Results of a multifaceted Intimate Partner Violence training program for pediatric residents

Author: McColgan, Maria D1; Cruz, Mario; McKee, Jessica; Dempsey, Sandra H; Davis, Martha B; Barry, Patricia; Yoder, Ana Lisa; Giardino, Angelo P1 Drexel University College of Medicine, St. Christopher's Hospital for Children, Philadelphia, PA, USA

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a multifaceted Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) intervention on knowledge, attitudes, and screening practices of pediatric residents. Methods: The intervention included: an on-site IPV counselor, IPV training for attending physicians, residents and social workers, and screening prompts. Evaluation included baseline and post-training surveys of residents, assessing their knowledge, attitudes, and comfort with IPV screening, patient chart reviews at baseline, 3 months, and 8 months for documentation of IPV screening, and review of the IPV counselor's client charts. Results: Baseline chart review showed screening rates of less than 1%. Screening rates were 36.2% at 3 months and 33.1% at 8 months. After training, residents were more likely to know: IPV screening questions (47.1% vs. 100%); referral sources (34.3% vs. 82.9%); and the relationship between child abuse and IPV (52.9% vs. 97.1%). At baseline, barriers to IPV screening included time (50%), lack of knowledge of how to screen (26.5%) and where to refer (23.5%). Post-training, barriers were time (44%), presence of children (25.9%) or other adults (18.5%) in the room, and inappropriate location (18.5%). Post-training, none of the residents listed 'lack of knowledge' or 'lack of referral sources' as barriers to IPV screening. After 12 months, 107 victims of IPV were identified; most referred from inpatient units and subspecialty clinics. Conclusion A multifaceted IPV intervention increased identification of IPV victims and markedly improved attitudes, comfort, and IPV screening practices of pediatric residents. IPV screening rates were sustainable with minimal ongoing training. Practice implications Consideration should be given to the training and practice supports necessary to encourage IPV screening in the pediatric setting. Educational efforts that familiarize pediatricians with the content surrounding the risk and potential impact of IPV to children and families along with practice supports that make incorporating screening for IPV as easy as possible have the potential to increase the identification of this problem and promote referrals to IPV agencies for follow-up and intervention where needed.

Domestic Violence or Elder Abuse? Why It Matters for Older Women

Author: Kilbane, Teresa1; Spira, Marcia1 Loyola U Chicago, IL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741611938?accountid=14925

Abstract: Law enforcement & legal services are two systems that respond to reports of abuse against women through programs such as adult protective services (APS) & domestic violence (DV). This paper will focus on these programs. APS & DV systems operate independently & define the cause of the problem differently. The designation of a woman as having suffered domestic violence or having been abused often depends on which system she enters. This designation can lead to different options for women to obtain services. Aging may further complicate access & usability of these systems to respond to the needs of abused elderly.

Prevalence and Factors of Domestic Violence Among Unmarried Mothers With a Young Child

Author: Huang, Chien-Chung1; Son, Esther; Wang, Lih-Rong1 Social Policy Research Center, National Taiwan U, Taipei huangc@rci.rutgers.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612960?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using the first three waves of the Fragile Families & Child Wellbeing Study, this article examines the prevalence & factors of domestic violence among unmarried mothers with a young child. The findings indicates that the prevalence of domestic violence for mothers increased substantially in the first 3 years after the child's birth. Findings from regression analyses show that mothers who were married or cohabited with the child's father were less likely to experience domestic violence than mothers who did not live with the child's father. Married & cohabiting mothers, however, did not experience significantly different levels of domestic violence. Policy implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Out of Africa: Coping Strategies of African Immigrant Women Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Ting, Laura11 School of Social Work, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61378959?accountid=14925

Abstract: We explored the coping behaviors of 15 immigrant African survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) in the United States. Similarities and differences in coping strategies between African and other immigrant women were noted. Results from the qualitative analysis are that African immigrant survivors utilized multiple coping strategies including beliefs in spirituality and divine retribution, a future orientation, and a sense of self-efficacy. Acceptance/ endurance of abuse, which they believe was 'normal' in male/ female relationships; minimization of the abuse; and avoidant behaviors and thoughts also were used. Informal and formal support/help seeking, and knowledge of available services empowered women. Implications for policy, practice, and future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic violence: the psychosocial impact and perceived health problems

Author: Brewer, Gayle; Roy, Mark; Smith, Yvonne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862598541?accountid=14925

Abstract: Self-reported health (and the extent to which this was associated with partner abuse or psychosocial variables) was investigated in 132 women recruited from a domestic violence service. The survey instrument included abuse disability, life event and daily stress exposure, social support, anger expression style, and perceived health status. The prevalence estimates for this sample were significantly higher than standard estimates across a range of health problems. Regression models demonstrated that whilst the extent of partner abuse predicted the prevalence of three conditions, psychosocial factors were more substantial predictors of health and well-being in domestic violence victims. Of these, life event frequency and anger expression were the most significant. These findings provide important information about the health of domestic violence victims as they seek support from domestic violence agencies, with relevance for practitioners working with victims who have terminated a violent relationship and for those supporting victims who remain with a violent partner. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic violence-related deaths

Author: Duff, Simon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862598518?accountid=14925

Abstract: An article in the NIJ Journal (Websdale, 2003) notes that domestic violence can provoke suicide. The 2003 Massachusetts Domestic Violence Homicide Report (Lauby et al, 2006) notes that suicide can be attributed to domestic violence incidents. Utah Domestic Violence Related Deaths 2006 (Utah Domestic Violence Council, 2006) notes that the majority of domestic violence-related suicides are not covered in their report. The report Domestic Violence Fatalities (2005) (Utah Department of Health, 2006) notes that there were 44 suicides and 21 homicide domestic violence-related deaths in Utah in 2005. Using data from the Surveillance for Violent Deaths - National Violent Death Reporting System, 16 States, 2005 (Karch et al, 2008), it is possible to extrapolate that as many as 7,832 male and 1,958 domestic violence-related suicides occur annually in the US. When domestic violence-related suicides are combined with domestic violence homicides, the total numbers of domestic violence-related deaths are higher for males than females. This paper recommends that to understand the broad scope and tragic impact of domestic violence, further research is needed concerning domestic violence-related suicide. Adapted from the source document.

A Multi-Leveled and Integrated Approach to Assessment and Intervention of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Rolling, Emily S1; Brosi, Matthew W1 Department of Human Development and Family Science, Oklahoma State University, 233 HES, Stillwater, OK 74078-6122, USA esrolling@gmail.com

Abstract: Intimate partner violence is a serious issue deeply embedded in multiple contexts both internal and external making treatment and interventions difficult to implement. Although numerous models offer vital insight into aspects of intimate partner violence, in isolation they may be less effective in addressing the unique elements and complexity of the abusive situation. Therefore, in order to provide an integrated and effective method of treatment, a multi-leveled theoretical approach delineating the change process is needed. Boss's contextual model of family stress provides a broad paradigm affording clarity and organization for assessment, intervention, and treatment. Each of the elements of the contextual model of family stress are presented and applied to a case study outlining one battered woman's experience. Clinical implications addressing stressors, resources, perceptions, and contextual elements are discussed as well as treatment recommendations. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence against Women in Cambodia: Husband's Control, Frequency of Spousal Discussion, and Domestic Violence Reported by Cambodian Women

Author: Eng, Sothy1; Li, Yingli; Mulsow, Miriam; Fischer, Judith1 Texas Tech University, Human Sciences Building, Room 507, 15th & Akron Street, Lubbock, TX 79409-1230, USA sothy.eng@ttu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743062928?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study sought to examine the effects of husband's control and frequency of spousal discussion on domestic violence against Cambodian married women, using the 2005 Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey data. The sample included 1,707 married women, aged 16--49 (M=35.14). Structural Equation Modeling showed that husband's control positively predicted both emotional and physical violence. Frequency of spousal discussion positively predicted emotional violence, an association consistent with the idea that a husband holding patriarchal beliefs would interpret women's more frequent discussion as a violation of Cambodian norms for quiet, submissive wives. Frequency of spousal discussion and husband's control were positively correlated. The role of gender issues in husband's control and frequency of spousal discussion are discussed with respect to violence in the lives of Cambodian women. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Female Genital Mutilation in Kenya: Effects of Ethnicity and Education

Author: Simister, John Gordon11 Management Department, Birkbeck College (University of London), Malet Street, London, WC1E 7HX, UK J.Simister@mbs.bbk.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743062456?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper investigates domestic violence against women, including definitions of 'domestic violence;' and investigates 'Female Genital Mutilation.' Data for this paper are from three national household surveys in Kenya: 'Demographic & Health Survey' (2003), Afrobarometer (2003), and 'Work, Attitudes, & Spending' (2004). Previous research in many countries has found convincing evidence of a tendency for domestic violence to be less common in households where the respondent and/or spouse have more education. This paper adds a new factor: the respondent's mother's education also seems relevant to prevalence of GBV (perhaps because of childhood socialization). This pattern applies to both experience of violence, and attitudes to such violence. There also appears to be a strong link between 'Female Genital Mutilation' (female circumcision) and mother's education level. In each case, more education is associated with less violence. Adapted from the source document.

Detecting Domestic Violence: Spanish External Validation of the Index of Spouse Abuse

Abstract: The aims of the study were to assess the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA), and to validate it against external criteria of intimate partner violence. The Spanish version of the ISA was administered to 223 non-abused women and 182 victims of intimate partner violence. Internal consistency coefficients oscillated between 0.88 and 0.98. The Confirmatory Factor Analysis failed to replicate the original two-factor structure. Using Exploratory Factor Analysis, a two-factor solution was found: physical (ISA-P) and non-physical (ISA-NP), but the items included in each factor were slightly different from the original two subscales. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an AUC value for the ISA global score of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-0.99), with the optimal cut-off of 12 for detecting intimate partner violence.

Treatment of Concurrent Substance Dependence, Child Neglect and Domestic Violence: A Single Case Examination Involving Family Behavior Therapy

Author: Romero, Valerie1; Donohue, Brad; Allen, Daniel N1 Achievement Center, Department of Psychology, University of Nevada Las Vegas, 4505 Maryland Parkway, Las Vegas, NV 89154-5030, USA

Abstract: Although child neglect and substance abuse co-occur in greater than 60% of child protective service cases, intervention outcome studies are deplorably lacking. Therefore, a home-based Family Behavior Therapy is described in the treatment of a woman evidencing child neglect, substance dependence, domestic violence and other co-occurring problems. Treatment included contingency management, self control, stimulus control, communication and child management skills training exercises, and financial management components. Results indicated improvements in child abuse potential, home hazards, domestic violence, and drug use, which were substantiated by objective urinalysis testing, and tours of her home. Validity checks indicated the participant was being truthful in her responses to standardized questionnaires, and assessors were 'blind' to study intent. Limitations (i.e., lack of experimental control and follow-up data collection) of this case example are discussed in light of these results. Adapted from the source document.

Exploring Factors Which Lead to Successful Reunification in Domestic Violence Cases: Interviews with Caseworkers

Author: Cole, Mary Ann1; Caron, Sandra L1 College of Education and Human Development, University of Maine, 5749 Merrill Hall, Room 220, Orono, ME 04469-5749, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612801?accountid=14925

Abstract: This exploratory study investigated factors that Child Protective Service caseworkers believe lead to change for the domestic violence abuser and victim, and ultimately lead to success in terms of reunifying children who have been removed from their parents due to domestic violence. In-depth interviews with six caseworkers examined both successful reunification cases and unsuccessful reunification cases. The interview was structured around three areas of interest: services, the caseworker's relationship with the parents, and social supports, in order to identify variables that may influence the family's ability (or inability) to make the necessary changes for reunification with their children. Results revealed that successful reunifications took place within the families who fully engaged in services, admitted the issues within the family home, set clear boundaries with each other, and sought and maintained an appropriate support system. Implications for caseworkers involved with families experiencing domestic violence, as well as directions for future research, are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Exposure to Family Violence in Childhood and Intimate Partner Perpetration or Victimization in Adulthood: Exploring Intergenerational Transmission in Urban Thailand

Author: Kerley, Kent R1; Xu, Xiaohe; Sirisunyaluck, Bangon; Alley, Joseph M1 Department of Justice Sciences, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1201 University Boulevard, Suite 210, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA krkerley@uab.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741613337?accountid=14925

Abstract: Investigators who study intimate partner violence have long recognized a relationship between exposure to violence in the family of origin and subsequent offending and victimization in the family context. This relationship holds not only for direct exposure (i.e., experiencing violence), but also for indirect exposure (i.e., witnessing violence against a parent or sibling). Typically, this relationship has been attributed to a social learning process that results in the intergenerational transmission of family violence. In this study, we explore intergenerational transmission in a sample of 816 married women in Bangkok, Thailand to determine how childhood exposure to violence in the family of origin is related to intimate partner perpetration and victimization during adulthood. Our results show that there are indeed long-term and significant effects of childhood exposure to family violence on the likelihood of Thai women's psychological and physical intimate partner perpetration. However, these effects appear to be indirect. Additionally, our results demonstrate a direct association between childhood exposure to parental intimate partner violence and subsequent psychological and physical victimization in adulthood.

The Effects of Change in Spousal Power on Intimate Partner Violence Among Chinese Immigrants

Author: Jin, Xiaochun1; Keat, Jane E1 New School University jinx@newschool.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60344088?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explored how changes in power relations within couples after immigrating from more patriarchal societies contribute to intimate partner violence (IPV). Both subjective decision-making power and objective power bases were examined in Chinese immigrant couples. Batterers and nonviolent men both experienced loss of decision-making power in favor of their spouses postimmigration. For the batterers, this loss appeared materialized by lower gains in education and lack of significant gains in income compared to their spouses. However, it was subjective power loss that was related to the batterers' attitudes toward IPV. The study highlights the significance of understanding changes in power dynamics postimmigration among immigrants and the importance of distinguishing between subjective and material power to better capture power imbalance within couples.

Adolescent Girls' Responses to Warning Signs of Abuse in Romantic Relationships: Implications for Youth-Targeted Relationship Violence Prevention

Author: Murphy, Kylie A1; Smith, David I1 RMIT University, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60359735?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explored adolescent girls' experiences of, and responses to, seven domains of partner behavior that are considered to be early warning signs of relationship abuse. Girls (N = 146) aged 14 to 18 years, attending schools in a semirural area, completed a purpose-built questionnaire, providing measures of self-reported exposure, perceived seriousness, and proposed response protectiveness in relation to each domain. Substantial proportions of girls (a) reported exposure to each of the domains, (b) lacked awareness particularly of the risks associated with jealous/possessive partner behaviors, and (c) regardless of their level of risk awareness, lacked knowledge of behavioral responses that might discourage continued warning-sign behaviors by their partners in all domains except for social restriction tactics. The implications of these findings for youth-targeted relationship abuse prevention are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Intimate Partner Violence and Contribution of Drinking and Sociodemographics: The Brazilian National Alcohol Survey

Author: Zaleski, Marcos1; Pinsky, Ilana; Laranjeira, Ronaldo; Ramisetty-Mikler, Suhasini; Caetano, Raul1 Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil mzaleski@terra.com.br

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60358698?accountid=14925

Abstract: Purpose: To estimate prevalence rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) among Brazilian couples and to assess the contribution of drinking and sociodemographic factors to the risk of IPV. Methods: A sample consisting of 1,445 married or cohabitating males and females in the Brazilian population was interviewed. The survey response rate was 66%. Results: The analyses indicate 10.7% and 14.6% prevalence, respectively for male-to-female and female-to-male IPV. Males were drinking in 38.1% of IPV events and females in 9.2%. The male's partner was drinking in 30.8% and the females' partner in 44.6% of IPV acts. Bivariate associations between violence and sociodemographics were found for age groups, household monthly income and educational level. Logistic regression analysis indicate that younger age for both male and female partners, men with no religious affiliation and women who are homemakers are significant predictors of violence. Conclusion: This survey provides important information to further IPV research in Brazil. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Japanese Women's Perceptions of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)

Author: Nagae, Miyoko1; Dancy, Barbara L1 Japanese Red Cross Toyota College of Nursing, Japan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60358516?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a problem in Japan. The purpose is to describe IPV as perceived by a purposive sample of 11 Japanese adult females who were in a heterosexual marriage at the time of IPV. We used a cross-sectional, retroactive, qualitative description research design with individual, fact-to-face in depth interviews. At the time of the interview, the women had a mean age of 38 years and at the time of the IPV, a mean age of 28 years. Data were analyzed using the directed qualitative content analysis method. The results revealed that all women experienced physical and emotional abuse and 82% experienced sexual abuse. Communication between spouses was characterized as unilateral, with husbands initiating and dominating the conversation. The women identified the culture of the Japanese patriarchal system as directly influencing IPV. The implication is health professionals should actively advocate for effective legislation and policies to address IPV. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Intimate Partner Violence in Young Adult Dating, Cohabitating, and Married Drinking Partnerships

Author: Wiersma, Jacquelyn D1; Cleveland, H Harrington; Herrera, Veronica; Fischer, Judith L1 The Pennsylvania State University

Abstract: Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study examined intimate partner violence (IPV) and drinking partnerships in 741 young adults in male-female dating, cohabitating, and married relationships. Cluster analyses revealed four similar kinds of drinking partnerships: (a) congruent light and infrequent, (b) discrepant male heavy and frequent, (c) discrepant female heavy and infrequent, and (d) congruent moderate/heavy-frequent drinkers. Overall, there were no significant main effect differences across relationship type and clusters. The type of relationship and the type of drinking partnership interacted with contexts examined (i.e., type of violence severity, gender, and whether the violence was perpetration or victimization). Given the severity of IPV in couple relationships, additional empirical attention to drinking partnerships is warranted. Adapted from the source document.

Sexual Risk Behaviors, Alcohol Abuse, and Intimate Partner Violence Among Sex Workers in Mongolia: Implications for HIV Prevention Intervention Development

Author: Witte, Susan S1; Batsukh, Altantsetseg; Chang, Mingway1 Social Intervention Group, Columbia University School of Social Work, New York, New York, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741609804?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines HIV/STI risk behaviors, alcohol abuse, intimate partner violence, and psychological distress among 48 female sex workers in Mongolia to inform the design of a gender-specific, HIV/STI prevention intervention for this population. Quantitative findings demonstrate that over 85% of women reported drinking alcohol at harmful levels; 70% reported using condoms inconsistently with any sexual partner; 83% reported using alcohol before engaging in sex with paying partners; and 38% reported high levels of depression. Focus group findings provide contextual support and narrative descriptions for the ways that poverty, alcohol abuse, interpersonal violence, and cultural norms that stigmatize and marginalize women are intertwined risk factors for STIs, including HIV, among these vulnerable women. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence Survivors: Spirituality and Social Support

Author: Jacinto, George A1; Turnage, Barbara F; Cook, Ida1 Arkansas State University, State University, Jonesboro, Arkansas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741613392?accountid=14925

Abstract: A review of the literature revealed that few domestic violence programs include ongoing social support or a focus on the spiritual concerns of domestic violence survivor. The literature appears to support the development of this spirituality and support group theory and confirms the importance of caring communities for domestic violence survivors and thrivers. The focus of this article is to propose a model of spirituality and social support for domestic violence survivors and thrivers. A synthesis of the Rite of Passage framework in combination with the Dance of the Spirit spiritual growth theory of Maria Harris is presented. An outline of a seven week spirituality group for those who have left the domestic violence situation is presented and implications for practice are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Bridging Pastoral Counseling and Social Work Practice: An Exploratory Study of Pastors' Perceptions of and Responses to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Moon, Sung Seek1; Shim, Woochan S1 School of Social Work, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, Texas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612548?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence is a prevalent yet highly underreported issue in the United States. Religious leaders are in a key position to help victims, particularly those who will not disclose the abuse to secular professionals such as police officers, doctors, and social workers. Church leaders tend to have close and trusting relationships, access to families' homes, are familiar with families' histories, and many times are the support to which victims turn. This study examines nine protestant pastors' perceptions of and responses to intimate partner violence as an exploratory study. Data were collected and analyzed through semistructured interviews and Strauss and Corbin's Grounded Theory. The findings illustrated that the majority of pastors perceive intimate partner violence as occurring to middle-aged women and being physical, emotional, and verbal in nature. The pastors reported that they assess, refer, and counsel the victims (and sometimes the couple together) and support divorce if necessary. The participants' avoidance toward intimate partner violence issues among their congregants were connected to their lack of training and access to resources. Implications for merging victim empowering counseling and pastoral counseling are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Middle School Youth: Satisfaction With and Responses to a Dating Violence and Sexual Assault Prevention Program

Author: Elias-Lambert, Nada1; Black, Beverly; Sharma, Yasoda1 School of Social Work, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, Texas, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612873?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined how group composition influences students' level of satisfaction with a dating violence and sexual assault prevention program. A 10- to 12-session program was presented to 396 urban African American middle school students in mixed- and same-gender groups. Both males and females were significantly more satisfied with the mixed-gender program than the same-gender program; females in both programs were significantly more satisfied than the males in both programs. Students especially liked the class activities, discussion, and teacher involvement in the program. The study findings support the importance of taking group composition and gender into consideration, as well as, students' reactions and recommendations when developing prevention programs for young adolescents. Adapted from the source document.

Pacific Youth and Shifting Thresholds: Understanding Teen Dating Violence in Hawai'i

Author: Baker, Charlene K1; Helm, Susana1 Department of Psychology, University of Hawai'i at Mnoa, Honolulu, Hawai'i

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612575?accountid=14925

Abstract: The high prevalence of teen dating violence (TDV) nationally suggests that it is a public health problem in need of intervention. However, there is limited information about what constitutes TDV in the eyes of teens. Equally limited is an understanding of these parameters among diverse cultures. To fill these gaps, the current study conducted focus groups with 51 adolescents of Native Hawaiian, Samoan, and Filipino descent. Youth were asked how they define TDV as a way to delineate their threshold for violence and related behaviors. Findings indicated that many forms of emotional TDV fall below teens' threshold, such as the use of cell phones and the Internet to monitor their dating partners. Possible venues and strategies for intervention are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Gender and Intimate Partner Violence: Evaluating the Evidence

Author: Gilfus, Mary E1; O'Brien, Patricia; Trabold, Nicole; Fleck-Henderson, Ann1 Simmons College School Social Work, Boston, MA mary.gilfus@simmons.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612047?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a complex social problem that social workers must be trained to address, using the best available evidence. In this article we review divergent theories, research findings, & methods that underpin debates about the role of gender in IPV perpetration & victimization. We examine the literature that contextualizes IPV & identifies different types of IPV & recommend training social workers to use differential assessment tools for IPV. We conclude that gender does matter in IPV & that social work students can critically evaluate the gender debates in selecting evidence for safe & effective practice. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This study examines the extent to which variations in program delivery affect the therapeutic environment and whether the therapeutic environment is associated with psychological and behavioral outcomes in a domestic violence perpetrator program. Seventy-seven offenders and 31 probation group tutors participated. It was found that groups with longer sessions were perceived more favorably by offenders than those with shorter sessions. A positive correlation was identified between group organization and offender attendance. No association between the therapeutic environment and posttreatment alleged reoffending within an 11-month follow-up period was identified. A supportive leader style was positively associated with the extent of clinically significant change identified on a range of psychological measures. These findings suggest that profeminist programs may exert a meaningful therapeutic effect.

'I Hate the Word "Victim"': An Exploration of Recognition of Domestic Violence in Same Sex Relationships

Author: Donovan, Catherine; Hester, Marianne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743044098?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article, drawing on interviews with women and men in same sex relationships who have experienced domestic violence, we explore the ways in which recognition of domestic violence can be hampered by public stories about the phenomenon and practices of love. Public stories construct domestic violence as a gendered, heterosexual phenomenon that is predominantly physical in nature. Victims of domestic violence are also constructed as 'other', weak and passive. In addition, we argue that practices of love obfuscate practices of violence; and can also result in victim/survivors constructing themselves as stronger than the perpetrator who needs their care. Adapted from the source document.

Formal and informal help-seeking associated with women's and men's experiences of intimate partner violence in Canada

Author: Ansara, Donna L; Hindin, Michelle J

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741611541?accountid=14925

Abstract: While numerous studies have documented the prevalence, correlates, and consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV); most of this research has used a criminal justice framework that has focused on acts of physical violence. However, critics argue that this narrow conceptualization of IPV belies the heterogeneity in this experience with respect to the nature of coercive control in the relationship. Moreover, they contend that the different types of abusive and controlling relationships not only have a different etiology, health consequences, and help-seeking characteristics, they also have a different relationship by gender. This study examined the extent to which different patterns of violence, abuse, and control were differentially associated with formal and informal help-seeking in a national Canadian sample. Data from the 2004 General Social Survey were analyzed, which included 696 women and 471 men who reported physical or sexual violence by a current or ex-spouse or common-law partner. The most commonly reported formal sources for women and men were health professionals (i.e., doctors, nurses, counselors, psychologists) and the police. For women, informal sources (i.e., family, friends, neighbors) were commonly reported across all IPV subgroups. However, the importance of almost all of the formal sources (e.g., health professionals, police, lawyers, shelters, crisis centers) increased as the severity of the violence and control increased. Shelters and crisis centers were also reported by a notable proportion of women who experienced the most severe pattern of violence and control. For men, both formal and informal sources were more commonly reported by those who experienced moderate violence and control compared with those who experienced relatively less severe acts of physical aggression. The results suggest that research that more sensitively examines people's experiences of violence and control can help identify their health, social, and safety needs; and ultimately better inform the development of programs and services aimed at addressing these needs.

Predicting Injuries of Women in Episodes of Intimate Partner Violence: Individual and Composite Risk Factors

Author: Greenleaf, Richard G1; Flexon, Jamie L; Lurigio, Arthur J; Snowden, Jessica A1 Elmhurst College

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741609890?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines incidents of intimate partner violence (IPV). The study involved a large sample of female victims and male perpetrators of IPV from Framingham, Massachusetts, just west of Boston. Physical injuries to IPV victims, which are sometimes serious and can be a harbinger of intimate partner homicide, were explored in order to explain the individual (and constellation of) factors that predict victim injury. We employed an innovative statistical technique that identified the profile or configuration of victim, perpetrator, and incident variables that predict victim injury. In applying various statistical techniques, different results emerged, which highlighted the complex nature of IPV. Adapted from the source document.

A Descriptive Study of a California Domestic Violence Court: Program Completion and Recidivism

Author: Petrucci, Carrie J11 EMT Associates Inc., Encino, California, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612988?accountid=14925

Abstract: This retrospective descriptive study analyzed a 1997 cohort of misdemeanor offenders (N = 289) in a California domestic violence court. Sixty-two percent of offenders completed a 52-week counseling program. A four-year statewide recidivism follow-up determined that for all types of arrests, rates were lower among program completers versus noncompleters (for domestic violence arrests, 15% versus 25%). Logistic regression revealed that completion was predicted by not using drugs, not getting a new case, pleading 'not guilty,' and an interaction of not having a concurrent case with not being ordered to a work program. Survival analyses identified key risk periods for arrest, and those with domestic violence priors recidivated soonest, as did those who either had drug/alcohol use or who did not complete counseling. Adapted from the source document.

Captive-Taking Incidents in the Context of Domestic Violence: A Descriptive Analysis

Author: Booth, Brandi1; Vecchi, Gregory M; Angleman, Amy J; Finney, Emmanuel J; Marker, Craig; Romano, Stephen J; Van Hasselt, Vincent B1 Center for Psychological Studies, Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612158?accountid=14925

Abstract: Captive-taking events in the context of domestic violence have received increased attention from law enforcement and mental health professionals. However, despite the high lethality risk of these situations, for both the partners involved as well as first responders (police officers, crisis negotiators), only a modicum of investigative activity has been directed to these incidents. Further, the few extant reports in this area are primarily clinical case studies or anecdotal accounts. The purpose of the present investigation was to expand on previous work by providing more descriptive analyses of these events in order to garner data potentially useful in crisis negotiators' efforts to resolve these critical incidents in a peaceful, nonviolent manner. Specifically, three categories of variables (demographic, situational, and outcome) were examined in cases obtained from the Hostage/Barricade Database System (HOBAS) maintained by the Crisis Negotiation Unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Results showed that (1) these incidents tend to be unplanned, (2) they occur in private residences, (3) third party intermediaries are judged to have minimal impact on the negotiated outcome, and (4) subjects tend to be white in their mid-30s or 40s with prior violent arrest and substance abuse histories. Further, white females are more likely to be victims. Extended family members and children are increasingly becoming involved in these situations. Additionally, five cases were chosen to reflect the primary categories of variables. Limitations of the study and implications for future research in this area are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Normative Misperceptions of Abuse Among Perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Neighbors, Clayton1; Walker, Denise D; Mbilinyi, Lyungai F; O'Rourke, Allison; Edleson, Jeffrey L; Zegree, Joan; Roffman, Roger A1 University of Houston, Texas cneighbors@uh.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743050086?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research was designed to evaluate the applicability of social norms approaches to interventions with male perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV). Participants included 124 nonadjudicated IPV perpetrating men recruited from the general population who completed assessment of their own IPV behaviors via telephone interviews and estimated the prevalence of behaviors in other men. Results indicated that IPV perpetrators consistently overestimated the percentage of men who engaged in IPV and that their estimates were associated with violence toward their partner over the past 90 days. Findings provide preliminary support for incorporating social norms approaches into clinical applications. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

At the Intersection of Interpersonal Violence, Masculinity, and Alcohol Use: The Experiences of Heterosexual Male Perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Peralta, Robert L1; Tuttle, Lori A; Steele, Jennifer L1 The University of Akron, OH

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741611224?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the relationship between violence, masculinity, and alcohol use among heterosexual, economically disadvantaged, and primarily Black men officially identified as batterers. Violence occurred against intimates and strangers. Alcohol use coupled with violence against intimates and violence against others (e.g., strangers) appeared to be used for masculinity construction. The use of alcohol before and during assaultive behavior combined with the use of violence symbolized dominance and control. This occurred in situations where markers of masculinity were largely absent (e.g., steady employment) in instances of both intimate partner violence and stranger violence.

Abstract: The Domestic Violence Home Visit Intervention (DVHVI) provides advocate/police officer team home visits following a domestic dispute. Women (52 DVHVI and 55 controls) were interviewed at 1, 6, and 12 months following a police reported domestic incident to assess repeat violence, service utilization, and symptoms. Women who received the DVHVI were more satisfied with the police and likely to call them to report a nonphysical domestic dispute in the 12 months following the initial incident than women in the comparison group. DVHVI participants were significantly more likely to use court-based services and seek mental health treatment for their children.

Intimate Partner Violence and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Among High-Risk Women: Does Pregnancy Matter

Author: Stampfel, Caroline C1; Chapman, Derek A; Alvarez, Andrea E1 Virginia Department of Health, Richmond caroline.stampfel@vdh.virginia.gov

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612623?accountid=14925

Abstract: Interviews from 655 women participating in the Chicago Women's Health Risk Study (CWHRS) were used to assess prevalence and factors associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Black women had the highest rate of IPV overall and among pregnant women, and had decreased odds of PTSD compared to Black nonpregnant women. Hispanic pregnant women, however, had decreased odds of IPV and PTSD compared to Hispanic nonpregnant women. Disparities in IPV by race/ ethnicity and pregnancy status complicate the study of IPV and PTSD and have implications for the public health community.

Graduating Social Work Students' Perspectives on Domestic Violence

Author: Black, Beverly M1; Weisz, Arlene N; Bennett, Larry W1 School of Social Work, University of Texas at Arlington, USA beverlyblack@uta.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741611662?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports the findings of a qualitative study that examined 124 social work students' views on the causes and dynamics of domestic violence and their recommended interventions in a case scenario. Most students graduated from the master of social work (MSW) program with a mental health perspective on domestic violence. Only a small percentage were aware of specific interventions for domestic violence and many continued to attribute domestic violence to mental health and substance abuse problems in the victim and perpetrator. Graduates with domestic violence experience varied little from their peers in suggested domestic violence interventions or comments about the causes of domestic violence. The findings suggest that a deliberate, focused attempt to inform students about domestic violence is needed, rather than a reliance on general MSW courses. This article presents research on social work graduates' views on the causes of domestic violence and interventions in domestic violence cases. Domestic violence continues to be a multifaceted problem that an estimated 22% of women experience over their lifetimes (Thoennes & Tjaden, 2000). Many people believe that a woman's behavior can contribute to intimate partner violence, some believe that women want to be abused, and a large majority believe that women can easily leave abusive relationships (Worden & Carlson, 2005). Overall, most people believe that the causes of domestic violence are rooted in the individual and family; few people view domestic violence as a problem with roots in society or culture (Worden & Carlson, 2005).

Domestic Violence Against Women: Systematic Review of Prevalence Studies

Abstract: To systematically review the worldwide evidence on the prevalence of domestic violence against women, to evaluate the quality of studies, and to account for variation in prevalence between studies, using consistent definitions and explicit, rigorous methods. Systematic review of prevalence studies on domestic violence against women. Literature searches of 6 databases were undertaken for the period 1995 to 2006. Medline, Embase, Cinahl, ASSIA, ISI, and International Bibliography of the Social Sciences were searched, supplemented by hand searching of the reference lists from studies retrieved and specialized interdisciplinary journals on violence. A total of 134 studies in English on the prevalence of domestic violence against women, including women aged 18 to 65 years, but excluding women with specific disabilities or diseases, containing primary, empirical research data, were included in the systematic review. Studies were scored on eight pre-determined criteria and stratified according to the total quality score. The majority of the studies were conducted in North America (41%), followed by Europe (20%). 56% of studies were population-based, and 17% were carried out either in primary or community health care settings. There was considerable heterogeneity both between and within geographical locations, health care settings, and study quality The prevalence of lifetime domestic violence varies from 1.9% in Washington, US, to 70% in Hispanic Latinas in Southeast US. Only 12% scored a maximum of 8 on our quality criteria, with 27% studies scored 7, and 17% scored 6. The mean lifetime prevalence of all types of violence was found to be highest in studies conducted in psychiatric and obstetric/gynecology clinics. Results of this review emphasize that violence against women has reached epidemic proportions in many societies. Accurate measurement of the prevalence of domestic violence remains problematic and further culturally sensitive research is required to develop more effective preventive policies and programs.

Traumatic Events and Maternal Education as Predictors of Verbal Ability for Preschool Children Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)

Author: Graham-Bermann, Sandra A1; Howell, Kathryn H; Miller, Laura E; Kwek, Jean; Lilly, Michelle M1 Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, 530 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1043, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743062946?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite research on the effects of intimate partner violence (IPV) on children, little is known about its impact on cognitive development. In this study, 87 preschool-aged children and their mothers exposed to IPV within the last two years participated in interviews to ascertain verbal ability, history of violence, and exposure to trauma. When compared to a national sample of 1,700 same-age children not evaluated for exposure to traumatic events, children exposed to IPV scored significantly lower on verbal ability, as assessed with standardized measures. In order to understand variation in verbal ability, multiple regression models were tested. Both prior exposure to traumatic events and the level of mother's education were significant predictors of verbal ability. However, level of education mediated the relationship between traumatic events and the child's verbal ability. Adapted from the source document.

Gender Differences in the Nature of the Intimate Partner Violence and Effects of Perpetrator Arrest on Revictimization

Author: Cho, Hyunkag1; Wilke, Dina J1 School of Social Work, Michigan State University, 254 Baker Hall, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA chohyu12@msu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741611761?accountid=14925

Abstract: The majority of research on intimate partner violence (IPV) has addressed male-to-female violence, although a small but growing body of literature has developed that explores males victimized by female partners. This study used data from the National Crime Victimization Survey from 1987 to 2003 to examine male victimization by comparing the nature of violence to female victimization and by exploring the effect of perpetrator arrest on preventing revictimization. The sample was comprised of 2,462 female and 298 male victims. Study variables included gender, arrest, revictimization, type of violence, injury, and use of a weapon. Results showed that men were victimized by IPV less frequently than women and received fewer injuries, although they were more likely to experience more severe violence. Police arrested female perpetrators, but generally only if injury was involved; however, arrest did not reduce male victims' chance of revictimization. Adapted from the source document.

Filial Therapy with Victims of Family Violence: a Phenomenological Study

Author: Kinsworthy, Sarah1; Garza, Yvonne1 Department of Educational Leadership and Counseling, Sam Houston State University, Box 2119, Huntsville, TX, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741613398?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research study examined the perceptions of parents, and victims of domestic violence, after receiving filial therapy. Specifically, parents were trained in a 10-week filial therapy model, Child--Parent Relationship Training. At the completion of the study, parents were given a semi-structured, open-ended style interview to gather information about their experiences. Themes emerged from the data participants provided, such as: experiencing increased warmth and trust in the child--parent relationship, changed parenting style, and decreased parental stress. Additionally, narratives reflect the positive influence the training had on parents' perceptions of violence. A summary of the essence of the parent's experiences is included. Adapted from the source document.

Self-Reported Communication Variables and Dating Violence: Using Gottman's Marital Communication Conceptualization

Author: Cornelius, Tara L1; Shorey, Ryan C; Beebe, Stacy M1 Department of Psychology, Grand Valley State University, 2116 Au Sable Hall, Allendale, MI 49401, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743056883?accountid=14925

Abstract: Communication behaviors, while extensively studied within the marital field, have received only peripheral attention in violent dating relationships. The purpose of this research was to better establish empirical continuity between the marital and dating literatures by exploring communication variables that have been identified in marital relationships broadly and their self-reported manifestation in violent dating relationships. Using Gottman's (1999) marital communication conceptualization, individuals were assessed on adaptive and maladaptive communication variables and relationship aggression. Results suggested that negative communication behaviors were associated with, and predicted, aggression in participants' dating relationships, consistent with findings from the marital literature. However, repair attempts, generally considered an adaptive communication behavior, predicted aggression victimization. Implications and how these data fit within the context of recent research on positive marital communication behaviors are explored. Adapted from the source document.

Depression Among Couples in the United States in the Context of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Vaeth, Patrice A C1; Ramisetty-Mikler, Suhasini; Caetano, Raul1 University of Texas School of Public Health patrice.vaeth@utsouthwestern.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743047203?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between intimate partner violence and depression. A multicluster random household sample of U.S. couples was interviewed as part of a five-year national longitudinal study (response rate = 72%). Depression was assessed with the CES-D. The multivariate analyses for men showed that the odds of depression did not vary significantly by type of male-to-female (MF) or female-to-male (FM) aggression. Men who engaged in infrequent binge drinking, compared to those who never binged, were less likely to be depressed, as were men with greater collective efficacy. For women, the multivariate analysis, showed that FM aggression (psychological: minor and severe, and physical) was associated with a greater likelihood of depression. Exposure to parental violence was also associated with depression. Women may experience depression as the result of psychological and physical aggression even if they are the perpetrators of such aggression.

Psychosocial Correlates of Physical Dating Violence Victimization Among Latino Early Adolescents

Author: Yan, Fang A1; Howard, Donna E; Beck, Kenneth H; Shattuck, Teresa; Hallmark-Kerr, Melissa1 University of Texas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810118503?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the association between dating violence victimization and psychosocial risk and protective factors among Latino early adolescents. An anonymous, cross-sectional, self-reported survey was administered to a convenience sample of Latino youth (n = 322) aged 11 to 13 residing in suburban Washington, D.C. The dependent variable was physical dating violence; the independent variables included violence, substance use, emotional well-being, prosocial behaviors, and parenting practices. Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed and adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were examined. Overall, 13.5% (n = 43) of Latino early adolescents reported being a victim of physical dating violence within the past year. The prevalence was 14.4% for girls and 12.9% for boys. Among the girls, binge drinking was the sole risk behavior associated with dating violence. Gun carrying, alcohol consumption, and having considered suicide were associated with dating violence among the boys. Physical dating violence appears to affect a small but significant proportion of Latino early adolescents and is associated with other risk behaviors. Healthy dating relationship programs are warranted for middle school youth with some tailoring to reflect gender differences in risk profiles.

Domestic Violence Against Married Women in Edirne

Author: Tokuc, Burcu1; Ekuklu, Galip; Avciolu, Serap1 Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey burcutok@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612434?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence and risk factors of domestic violence against married women in Edirne, Turkey. This is a cross-sectional study which included a representative sample of the married women living in the Provincial Center of Edirne. The total past year prevalence of some forms of physical domestic violence is 34% in the last 12 months. 93% of women reported that they have been experiencing different forms of verbal and psychological domestic violence. The important risk factors for physical domestic violence were being Roma woman (OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.44-6.12), living with more than four people in the household (OR = 2.29, 95% CI: 1.21-4.36), being unemployed (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.06-4.37), and got married only with her families' decision (OR = 4.60, 95% CI: 1.42-14.80). Our findings conclude that patriarchal and traditional values, women's lack of financial autonomy, and low socioeconomic status are the risk factors for physical domestic violence.

Relationship Between Recent Life Events, Social Supports, and Attitudes to Domestic Violence

Author: Guoping, Huang1; Yalin, Zhang; Yuping, Cao; Momartin, Shakeh; Ming, Wei1 Mental Health Center of Sichuan Province, Mianyang City, China

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743043669?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of the study was to assess the relationship between recent life events, attitudes to domestic violence (DV), and DV behaviors among perpetrators of DV in China. A total of 600 participants were assessed for recent life events, psychological functioning, social support, and attitudes to DV. Results demonstrated that recent negative life events (NLE) and attitudes to DV were predictive factors for DV among perpetrators of DV, after controlling for demographic variables, psychological functioning, and social supports. The findings suggest that recent life events are potential factors contributing to behaviors of DV. The importance of changes of negative attitudes to DV among perpetrators was highly emphasized. Intervention and prevention programs based on psychological functioning and social support in relation to perpetrators of DV may be useful to control DV in China.

Help-Seeking Behaviors and Reasons for Help Seeking Reported by a Representative Sample of Women Victims of Intimate Partner Violence in New Zealand

Author: Fanslow, Janet L1; Robinson, Elizabeth M1 University of Auckland j.fanslow@auckland.ac.nz

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612811?accountid=14925

Abstract: Efforts to understand and support the process of help seeking by victims of intimate partner violence are of considerable urgency if we are to design systems and responses that are capable of actively and appropriately meeting the needs of victims. Using data from the New Zealand Violence Against Women Study, which drew from a representative general population sample of women aged 18 to 64 years, the authors report on the help-seeking behaviors of the women who had ever in their lifetime experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner (n = 956). More than 75% of respondents reported that they had told someone about the violence, indicating that it is not necessarily a "secret and private" problem. However, more than 40% of women indicated that no one had helped them. Informal sources of support (family and friends) were most frequently told about the violence but not all provided helpful responses. Fewer women told formal sources of help such as police, health care providers, and not all provided helpful responses. Women's reasons for seeking help and for leaving violent relationships were similar and included "could not endure more," being badly injured, fear or threat of death, and concern for children. Women's reasons for staying in or returning to violent relationships included perception of the violence as "normal/not serious," her emotional investment in the relationship, or staying for the sake of the children. The findings suggest that broader community outreach is required to ensure that family and friends are able to provide appropriate support for women in abusive relationships who are seeking help. Continued improvement in institutional responses is also required. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

The Influence of Romantic Attachment and Intimate Partner Violence on Non-Suicidal Self-Injury in Young Adults

Author: Levesque, Christine1; Lafontaine, Marie-France; Bureau, Jean-Francois; Cloutier, Paula; Dandurand, Cathy1 School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, 200 Lees, Room E-106, Ottawa, Ontario, K1N 6N5, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/754038544?accountid=14925

Abstract: Several theoretical models for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) have been proposed. Despite an abundance of theoretical speculation, few empirical studies have examined the impact of intimate relationship functioning on NSSI. The present study examines the influence of romantic attachment and received intimate partner violence (physical, psychological and sexual) on recent reports of NSSI behaviors and thoughts. The sample was composed of 537 (79.9% female) primarily Caucasian university students between the ages of 18 and 25 years and currently involved in a romantic relationship. The results reveal that anxiety over abandonment was a significant predictor of NSSI thoughts and behaviors in women and a significant predictor of NSSI thoughts in men. Moreover, the experience of intimate partner violence emerged as a significant predictor of NSSI behaviors in both men and women. Continued empirical investigations into the influence of intimate relationship functioning on NSSI will facilitate the development of psychological interventions for young adults dealing with self-harm. Adapted from the source document.

Partner abuse or violence, parenting and neighborhood influences on children's behavioral problems

Author: O'Campo, Patricia; Caughy, Margaret O; Nettles, Saundra M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743050943?accountid=14925

Abstract: We examined the relationship between neighborhood characteristics, parenting behaviors, experiences of intimate partner abuse or violence (IPV) and children's behavioral problems in a socioeconomically diverse sample of 383 families residing in an urban environment. Data were collected in the Fall/Winter of 2002. The census block group of residence was used as our measure of neighborhood. Census block groups typically contain 1500 residents on average. IPV was measured using a modified version of the HITS (physically Hurt, Insult, Threaten, and Screamed at) scale, a short four item tool assessing emotional and physical violence to which we added an item capturing domination or emotional control. IPV in the last year was reported by 50% of the sample with rates varying by socioeconomic position; families with the lowest and highest income reported the most IPV. Patterns of association between parenting, neighborhood and the children's behavioral problems differed for families who reported IPV in the last year compared to families who reported no IPV. While positive neighborhood characteristics such as high levels of Community Involvement with Children - based upon four scales capturing neighborhood levels of social interaction and collective socialization of children - were protective for high levels of behavioral problems among families not reporting IPV, this protective effect was not seen among families who did report IPV. Hypothesized interactions between negative neighborhood characteristics and IPV - namely that behavioral problems would be worse among families experiencing IPV in highly economically deprived or areas with negative social climates - were not supported by our data. These interactions between neighborhood factors and IPV were not explained by parental factors. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

A Narrative Journey for Intimate Partner Violence: From Victim to Survivor

Author: Brosi, Matthew W1; Rolling, Emily S1 Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741613521?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this research was to examine the decision-making process of battered women from a Narrative framework and to identify the major internal and external constructs (emphasizing unique outcomes, dominant cultural narratives, and support for new narratives) which allow for these women to re-story their lives. Several themes emerged indicating that the decision-making processes is dependent upon the ability to capture positive moments in their lives without allowing the perceived influence of dominant cultural narratives to override these moments. The process is further clouded by perception of available social networks and resources that support change of her narrative. Adapted from the source document.

Mothers, Domestic Violence, and Child Protection

Author: Douglas, Heather1; Walsh, Tamara1 University of Queensland, St Lucia, Queensland, Australia h.douglas@law.uq.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743053784?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores the relationship between understandings of domestic violence and the child protection response drawing on material gathered in focus groups with workers who support mothers dealing with both domestic violence and child protection issues. The interviewees expressed concern that the dynamics of domestic violence are often misunderstood and inappropriately responded to by child protection workers. This article critically examines the interviewees' concerns and concludes that to properly protect children, it is crucial that child protection workers have a clear understanding of the dynamics of and issues related to domestic violence.

Mothers, Domestic Violence, and Child Protection: An American Legal Perspective

Author: Goodmark, Leigh11 University of Baltimore School of Law lgoodmark@ubalt.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743053837?accountid=14925

Abstract: In their article, "Mothers, Domestic Violence, and Child Protection," Heather Douglas and Tamara Walsh explore the problematic treatment of battered mothers by the child protection system in Brisbane, Australia. Their study documents a number of troubling trends, including mother blaming for failure to protect, inappropriate removals of children from protective mothers, placement of children with fathers who had battered their partners, and the ill-advised "leaving ultimatum" -- the order that a mother who has been battered leave her abusive partner to show her intention to protect her children from further exposure to violence. These trends are not unique to the Australian child protection system in the United States -- problems that, to some degree, are created and exacerbated by statutes, case law, and practice.

Intimate Partner Violence and Maternal Depression During the Perinatal Period: A Longitudinal Investigation of Latinas

Author: Rodriguez, Michael A1; Valentine, Jeanette; Ahmed, Sawssan R; Eisenman, David P; Sumner, Lekeisha A; Heilemann, MarySue V; Liu, Honghu1 University of California, Los Angeles mrodriguez@mednet.ucla.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741609857?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study assessed the course of perinatal depression among 210 Latinas who were and were not affected by intimate partner violence (IPV) and identified associated psychosocial factors. Peak depression prevalence occurred prenatally among 45.7% of IPV-exposed and 24.6% of non-IPV-exposed Latinas. At each assessment, depression was significantly higher for IPV-exposed compared to non-IPV-exposed mothers. Mastery and social support were associated with lower depression, whereas history of IPV, perceived stress, and avoidant coping behaviors were associated with higher depression. Findings support recommendations for routine depression and IPV screening of Latinas in perinatal clinical settings. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Birth Control Sabotage and Forced Sex: Experiences Reported by Women in Domestic Violence Shelters

Author: Thiel de Bocanegra, Heike1; Rostovtseva, Daria P; Khera, Satin; Godhwani, Nita1 University of California, San Francisco

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743054421?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women who experience intimate partner violence often experience birth control sabotage, forced sex, and partner's unwillingness to use condoms. We interviewed 53 women at four domestic violence shelters. Participants reported that their abusive partners frequently refused to use condoms, impeded them from accessing health care, and subjected them to birth control sabotage, infidelity, and forced sex. However, women also reported strategies to counteract these actions, particularly against birth control sabotage and attempts to force them to abort or continue a pregnancy. Domestic violence counselors can focus on these successful strategies to validate coping skills and build self-esteem. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Women's movement and the politics of framing: The construction of anti- domestic violence legislation in South Korea

Author: Heo, MinSook

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743061958?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article discusses the emergence of the campaign to construct and pass anti-domestic violence legislation in South Korea. It introduces aspects of the political and cultural context and analyzes choices and negotiations involved in deciding on an effective strategy to support legislation-framing strategy. The framing strategy was intended to transform and subvert problematic cultural concepts that deemed wife abuse a private, trivial and even benign aspect of married life. While the article demonstrates that the framing played a crucial role in arousing government response to the issue of violence against women, it also shows some unanticipated consequences that resulted from the agreed upon frame and from the institutionalization of responsibilities for implementing the legislation. By exploring feminist movement against domestic violence in the local context, the article suggests that success of the anti-domestic violence legislation movement and unintended consequences of state intervention in domestic violence can be relatively discussed and anticipated.

The Role of Socioeconomic Status in Interactions with Police Among a National Sample of Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Cattaneo, Lauren Bennett11 Department of Psychology, George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, MSN 3F5, Fairfax, VA, 22030, USA, lcattane@gmu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810935400?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using a national dataset of 820 women who had called the police for an incident of intimate partner violence, this study explored the relationship between several components of socioeconomic status (education, income, and employment), race, and the nature of interactions with police. Over and above the effects of control variables (the presence of an advocate on the scene, the severity of violence in the relationship, and prior calls to police), victims with higher education reported less positive interactions, less control during the interactions, and lower effectiveness of police. Race did not moderate these relationships, and the other components of socioeconomic status were not significantly related to any of the outcomes. Exploratory tests of mediation found that the relationship between education and the quality of interactions with police was explained by the fact that more educated victims felt they had less control in these incidents and were less likely to see the offender arrested. Results also provide evidence for the positive impact of advocates on interactions with police. Implications for research and policy are discussed.

HIV/AIDS Risk Reduction Intervention for Women who have Experienced Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Rountree, Michele Angela1; Mulraney, Meredith1 University of Texas at Austin, 1925 San Jacinto Blvd., Room 3.122E, Austin, TX, 78712-0358, USA mrountree@mail.utexas.edu

Abstract: A growing body of literature highlights the association between women who have experienced intimate partner abuse (IPA) and their heightened risk for HIV/AIDS (human immune deficiency syndrome/acquired immune deficiency syndrome) infection. Finding HIV risk reduction strategies that are contextually relevant for this population is an important public policy priority. This qualitative study researched women who have experienced IPA in order to develop a HIV/AIDS risk reduction intervention unique to their circumstances. This pilot study explored the critical components of such an intervention among a racially/ethnically stratified (African-American, Mexican-American and Anglo) sample of women (n=43) who have experienced IPA. Focus groups were conducted and transcribed, and a content analysis was used to identify major themes. In all five focus groups, participants viewed the research as interesting, good, beneficial, and/or important based on their perceptions of risk for infection. Respondents felt that they knew of ways to protect themselves from infection in non-abusive relationships; however, acknowledged the difficulties of doing so given the context of their abusive relationships. Examining the racial/ethnic differences across focus groups showed that the language used by women is quite variable. The ways in which survivors define rape, sexual abuse, and their own experiences are all unique; however, their actual experiences have many similarities. Discussed at length are the topics participants shared as critical in informing the design of an intervention and the relevance of the findings to social work clinical practice is explained. Adapted from the source document.

Substance Use Disorders in Perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence in a Forensic Setting

Author: Kraanen, Fleur L1; Scholing, Agnes; Emmelkamp, Paul M G1 University of Amsterdam

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743054771?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study investigates the point prevalence of substance use disorders in 150 perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV) in a forensic setting and compares participants with and without substance use disorders on demographic and offence-related variables. Furthermore, it investigates the frequency of IPV perpetrated under the influence of substances. Half the sample (50.0%) meets diagnostic criteria for at least one substance-related diagnosis. Significantly more IPV perpetrators without substance use disorders compared with IPV perpetrators with substance use disorders have children living at home and have abused their children. Relative to IPV perpetrators without substance use disorders, significantly more IPV perpetrators with substance-related disorders are found to be under the influence of substances at the time of the offence. Results highlight the importance of understanding the prevalence of substance use disorders in IPV perpetrators in forensic settings.

Exposure to Domestic Violence Between Parents: A Perspective From Tehran, Iran

Author: Vameghi, Meroe1; Feizzadeh, Ali; Mirabzadeh, Arash; Feizzadeh, Golnaz1 University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran, arashmirabzadeh@uswr.ac.ir

Abstract: Women may bear the brunt of domestic violence, but children are also inflicted by the consequences of violence between their parents. We sought to evaluate the lifetime prevalence of exposure to physical violence between parents among some senior secondary school students in Tehran. The study was conducted on senior secondary school students in all 19 educational districts of the Iranian capital, Tehran, in the academic year of 2005-06 using a multi-stage sampling. Data were collected via a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 1,495 students participated in this survey, with the prevalence estimated at 22.8%. More than half of the subjects had witnessed domestic violence between their parents; the prevalence of exposure among the girls was twice that among the boys. The most frequent act of violence was beating the partner with bare hands and the perpetrators of the violent acts were predominantly the fathers. Exposure was long-lasting; and in those with more than one exposure, the mean duration of exposure was 5.1 years. The most prevalent rates of exposure to domestic violence came from Educational Districts 15 and 10. The fact that a considerable portion of the teenagers in the present study had witnessed physical violence between their parents bears testimony to the high frequency of this form of violence in Tehran households. It is noteworthy that the socio-economic status of the families and parental divorce and estrangement increased the likelihood of exposure to domestic violence in our series.

Drug Use and Intimate Partner Violence Among College Students: An In-Depth Exploration

Author: Nabors, Erin L11 University of Central Florida, Orlando, USA enabors@mail.ucf.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743045796?accountid=14925

Abstract: College students experience an extremely high level of violence among intimate partners during their college careers, with prevalence rates ranging between 20% and 50%. Because intimate partner violence (IPV) among college students is such a widespread problem, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to this type of abuse. Studies using a variety of samples demonstrate that drug use is one such factor. However, research to date fails to identify specific types of drugs linked to college students' use of violence against intimates. In an attempt to fill this void, this exploratory study uses data from the Relationship Characteristics Study, which was conducted in 2001 and includes a sample of 1,938 college students, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between college students' drug use and IPV perpetration than the current literature allows.

Mother Abuse: A Matter of Youth Justice, Child Welfare or Domestic Violence?

Author: Hunter, Caroline1; Nixon, Judy; Parr, Sadie1 York Law School, University of York, Heslington, York YO10 5DD, England

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743047351?accountid=14925

Abstract: International evidence suggests that in advanced welfare states the abuse of parents, most particularly mothers, by their (most frequently male) adolescent children is increasingly prevalent. In the United Kingdom, however, child-to-mother abuse remains one of the most under-acknowledged and under-researched forms of family violence. Although it is an issue shrouded in silence, stigma, and shame, the authors' work in the youth justice sphere, focusing on interventions to deal with anti-social behaviour, suggests that adolescent violence toward mothers is a topical and prevalent issue. We identify different ways of conceptualizing it in the policy realms of youth justice, child welfare, and domestic violence. The behaviour of both child/young person and mother is constructed in ways which inform the assignment of blame and responsibility. The paper highlights the silence that surrounds the issue in both the policy and wider academic spheres, hiding the failure of service providers to respond to this very destructive form of intimate interpersonal violence. Adapted from the source document.

The Structure of Male Adolescent Peer Networks and Risk for Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration: Findings from a National Sample

Author: Casey, Erin A1; Beadnell, Blair1 University of Washington, Tacoma, 1900 Commerce, Box 358425, Tacoma, WA 98402, USA ercasey@u.washington.edu

Abstract: Although peer networks have been implicated as influential in a range of adolescent behaviors, little is known about relationships between peer network structures and risk for intimate partner violence (IPV) among youth. This study is a descriptive analysis of how peer network 'types' may be related to subsequent risk for IPV perpetration among adolescents using data from 3,030 male respondents to the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Sampled youth were a mean of 16 years of age when surveyed about the nature of their peer networks, and 21.9 when asked to report about IPV perpetration in their adolescent and early adulthood relationships. A latent class analysis of the size, structure, gender composition and delinquency level of friendship groups identified four unique profiles of peer network structures. Men in the group type characterized by small, dense, mostly male peer networks with higher levels of delinquent behavior reported higher rates of subsequent IPV perpetration than men whose adolescent network type was characterized by large, loosely connected groups of less delinquent male and female friends. Other factors known to be antecedents and correlates of IPV perpetration varied in their distribution across the peer group types, suggesting that different configurations of risk for relationship aggression can be found across peer networks. Implications for prevention programming and future research are addressed. Adapted from the source document.

Mediator Assessment, Documentation, and Disposition of Child Custody Cases Involving Intimate Partner Abuse: A Naturalistic Evaluation of One County's Practices

Author: Beck, Connie J A1; Walsh, Michele E; Mechanic, Mindy B; Taylor, Caitilin S1 Psychology, Policy and Law Program, Department of Psychology, University of Arizona, 1503 E. University Blvd., Room 312, P.O. Box 210068, Tucson, AZ, 85721-0068, USA beck@u.arizona.edu

Abstract: The contentious and costly nature of the adversarial process for resolving child custody disputes has prompted scholars, practitioners, and policy makers to advocate for the development and implementation of less divisive forms of dispute resolution, notably, mediation. Mediation has been championed for its potential to resolve disputes with less acrimony among disputants, reduced economic costs, increased satisfaction with outcomes, and fewer adverse consequences for family members. Despite the increasing popularity, arguments have cautioned against the use of mandated mediation when intimate partner abuse (IPA) is alleged. This research documents a mediation screening process and models mediators' decision-making process as instantiated, naturally, in one jurisdiction. Adapted from the source document.

Religiosity, Christian Fundamentalism, And Intimate Partner Violence Among U.S. College Students

Author: Koch, Jerome R1; Luis Ramirez, Ignacio1 Texas Tech University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/754039384?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between religious behavior, religious belief, and intimate partner violence. Survey data were gathered from a sample of undergraduates (N = 626). Our dependent variables were derived from conflict tactics scales and Strauss's Personal and Relationships Profile, measuring violence approval, psychological aggression and intimate partner violence. Our two substantive independent variables were, first, religiosity as a scale containing questions from the General Social Survey, and second, Christian fundamentalism as a scale used in previously published research. General religiosity, measured as belief in God, strength of religious faith, church attendance, and frequency of prayer, was not associated with violence approval, psychological aggression, or intimate partner violence. However, Christian fundamentalism was positively associated with both violence approval and acts of intimate partner violence, but not psychological aggression. Adapted from the source document.

Male reproductive control of women who have experienced intimate partner violence in the United States

Author: Moore, Ann M; Frohwirth, Lori; Miller, Elizabeth

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741611151?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) are consistently found to have poor sexual and reproductive health when compared to non-abused women, but the mechanisms through which such associations occur are inadequately defined. Through face-to-face, semi-structured in-depth interviews, we gathered full reproductive histories of 71 women aged 18-49 with a history of IPV recruited from a family planning clinic, an abortion clinic and a domestic violence shelter in the United States. A phenomenon which emerged among 53 respondents (74%) was male reproductive control which encompasses pregnancy-promoting behaviors as well as control and abuse during pregnancy in an attempt to influence the pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy promotion involves male partner attempts to impregnate a woman including verbal threats about getting her pregnant, unprotected forced sex, and contraceptive sabotage. Once pregnant, male partners resort to behaviors that threaten a woman if she does not do what he desires with the pregnancy. Reproductive control was present in violent as well as non-violent relationships. By assessing for male reproductive control among women seeking reproductive health services, including antenatal care, health care providers may be able to provide education, care, and counseling to help women protect their reproductive health and physical safety.

Reporting to the Police as a Response to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Podana, Zuzana11 Department of Sociology, Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague, Celetna 20, 116 42 Prague 1 zuzana.podana@ff.cuni.cz

Abstract: Research on police involvement in cases of intimate partner violence (IPV) focuses mainly on best intervention strategies and often neglects the key prerequisite of any intervention: the victim's decision to contact the police. This article concentrates on the circumstances that make IPV incidents more likely to be reported to the police, and it also analyses the reasons for victims' not reporting and for their distrust of the police. It makes use of data from the Czech part of the International Violence Against Women Survey, which allows us to analyse the reporting behaviour of 709 female victims of IPV. The reporting rate among them is very low - only 8%. Logistic regression models of reporting confirmed the high relevance of the features of the particular incident and revealed also several factors related to the history of violence in the relationship; on the other hand, the victim's resources were found to have no influence. Distrust of the police proved to be an important factor for not reporting to the police (29% of women), and further analysis of this factor suggested the possible occurrence of learned helplessness syndrome among some victims. An additional substantial outcome of this study is its highlighting of the importance of different forms of psychological abuse (threats vs. control) which have diverse effects on victims' reporting behaviour. Adapted from the source document.

Promoting Distributive Justice for Intimate Partner Violence Survivors With Group Intervention

Author: Chronister, Krista M1; Davidson, M Meghan1 University of Oregon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612017?accountid=14925

Abstract: Advancing Career Counseling and Employment Support for Survivors (ACCESS; Chronister, 2006) is a group intervention designed to foster the career development of women who have experienced intimate partner violence. The ACCESS curriculum is based on theory and research from multiple disciplines including intimate partner violence, counseling, and vocational psychology. The purpose of ACCESS is to contribute to distributive justice for survivors by restoring vocational and economic opportunities that have been diminished by abusive partners and oppressive social structures. This article focuses on group processes used to facilitate ACCESS activities and promote justice by fostering survivors' mental health and vocational development. Adapted from the source document.

Do Differing Types of Victimization and Coping Strategies Influence the Type of Social Reactions Experienced by Current Victims of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Sullivan, Tami P1; Schroeder, Jennifer A; Dudley, Desreen N; Dixon, Julia M1 Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT tami.sullivan@yale.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741609773?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines whether differing types of victimization and coping strategies influence the type of social reactions experienced by 173 current victims of intimate partner violence (IPV). Results of path analyses showed that psychological and sexual IPV victimization were related to positive social reactions, whereas physical, psychological, and sexual IPV victimization were related to negative social reactions. Indirect relationships between victimization and social reactions differed by types of coping strategies (social support, problem solving, and avoidance) examined. Implications are discussed regarding the development of interventions with women's support networks and the augmentation of services to help victims modify their coping strategies.

Screening for Intimate Partner Violence in Reproductive Health Centers: An Evaluation Study

Author: Colarossi, Lisa G1; Breitbart, Vicki; Betancourt, Gabriela S1 Planned Parenthood of New York City, New York, New York, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758122461?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study compared rates of intimate partner violence reports on a new, empirically-developed screening tool completed by 385 women in 2007 to those from an older tool completed by 420 women in 2006. Data were obtained from randomly selected medical charts across three health center locations, which were part of the same reproductive health care organization. Chi-square analyses were conducted to test associations between demographic characteristics and partner violence reports. Multiple regression analyses were used to compare odds ratios of disclosure by type of screening tool, adjusting for associated demographic factors associated with partner violence reports. Women completing the old and new tools were similar across all demographic characteristics. After adjusting for age and center location, women completing the new screening form were more than 2.5 times as likely to report any partner violence. When analyzed by mutually exclusive violence history categories, women completing the new screening form were over 2.5 times as likely to report past or current violence and over 4 times as likely to report experiencing both past and current violence. Findings suggest that implementing empirically developed brief screening tools for partner violence in reproductive health settings may elicit more disclosures from patients than more traditional tools.

Criminal justice involvement and service need among men on methadone who have perpetrated intimate partner violence

Author: Wu, Elwin1; El-Bassel, Nabila; Gilbert, Louisa; Sarfo, Bright; Seewald, Randy1 Social Intervention Group, Columbia University School of Social Work, New York, NY, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/754043606?accountid=14925

Abstract: Perpetrators of male-to-female intimate partner violence (IPV) may be likely to have multiple service needs, the extent of which may vary with respect to criminal justice involvement. The salience of the criminal justice system and the potential impact on service needs due to arrest and incarceration is underscored given the association between substance use and IPV. This study utilized a sample of men in methadone treatment who perpetrated male-to-female IPV in order to examine associations between criminal justice involvement and perceived additional service need(s). Results indicate that the likelihood of having service needs significantly increased as time since most recent arrest or incarceration decreased. These findings highlight the need and potential benefit that can be derived from greater coordination amongst the criminal justice, IPV prevention, and drug treatment systems and service providers.

Youth Action Strategies in the Primary Prevention of Teen Dating Violence

Author: Kervin, Denise1; Obinna, Jennifer1 Family Support Center, Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin

Abstract: This article describes a school-based youth-driven teen dating violence prevention project. The project objectives are to provide opportunities for students to plan presentations and activities; develop knowledge and awareness about unhealthy gender norms, seen as an important root cause of relationship violence, particularly for teenagers; and identify ways to cope with and influence their environment with respect to this issue. This project was conducted in a rural Wisconsin community over the course of 5 years. It started as a multischool 'drop-in' program with students from various high schools but eventually evolved into a youth action team at an alternative high school as a for-credit service learning class. Evaluation findings show the project to have promise in changing individual attitudes and beliefs while promoting bystander intervention. This youth-led health approach provides excellent opportunities for youth to become involved and empowered, and collaborating with schools can also be a successful strategy. Because unhealthy gender norms are so deeply entrenched, it is important to document and celebrate the smallest positive shifts in attitudes and behaviors. Adapted from the source document.

'I Didn't Want To Put Them Through That': The Influence Of Children on Victim Decision-making in Intimate Partner Violence Cases

Author: Rhodes, Karin V1; Cerulli, Catherine; Dichter, Melissa E; Kothari, Catherine L; Barg, Frances K1 Division of Emergency Care Policy & Research, Department of Emergency Medicine & School of Social Policy & Practice, University of Pennsylvania, 3815 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19014, USA

Abstract: For mothers, intimate partner violence (IPV) presents a concern not only for their own well-being but also for that of their children who are exposed to the violence and its aftermath. In focus groups with adult women (N=39) across three jurisdictions who had experienced legal system intervention for IPV victimization, mothers raised unsolicited concerns about the negative effects of IPV exposure on their children. These comments were not prompted by the facilitator but were raised by women in all seven of the focus groups during discussions about motivations and barriers to participation in prosecution of their abusive partners. The overall message was that victims with children felt very conflicted. Children both facilitate and inhibit leaving the abusive relationship. Mothers wanted to spare their children from harmful effects of violence but also wanted to keep their families together and protect their children from potential agitation and instability caused by legal system involvement. Participants described how fears and threats of involvement from child protective services inhibited help-seeking while simultaneously voicing a desire for services that would help their children. More research is needed to help service providers understand the quagmire mothers who are victims of IPV encounter regarding their children's wellbeing. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Attitudes and Experience Among Women and Men in Uganda

Author: Speizer, Ilene S11 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Ilene_speizer@unc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741609543?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines intimate partner violence (IPV) attitudes and experience among women and men in Uganda to inform IPV-prevention programs in the region. Nationally representative population-based data from women aged 15 to 49 and men aged 15 to 54 were collected between May and October 2006 as part of the Uganda Demographic and Health Survey. The survey included questions on women's and men's attitudes toward wife beating and information on IPV victimization (women) and perpetration (men). More than half of men and nearly three quarters of women have attitudes supportive of wife beating in Uganda. More than half of married women report IPV victimization, and 40% of married men report perpetration. Women and men who reported witnessing their fathers beating their mothers were more likely to report IPV victimization (perpetration for men). Witnessing violence was also associated with positive attitudes toward wife beating among men. IPV-prevention programs need to address the important role of having witnessed wife beating between the mother and the father on men's subsequent attitudes and behaviors. Women who witnessed wife beating are also the most likely to have supportive attitudes and IPV experience, possibly indicating that their relationship expectations are different than women who did not witness violence. Community-based prevention programs targeting men and women are needed in Uganda and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa where gender norms that justify IPV prevail.

Does the Situational Couple Violence- Intimate Terrorism Typology Explain Cohabitors' High Risk of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Brownridge, Douglas A11 University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada Douglas_Brownridge@umanitoba.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743063642?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines M. P. Johnson's assertion that violence in marital unions is more likely to be intimate terrorism (IT) and violence in cohabiting unions is more likely to be situational couple violence (SCV). Having overcome limitations of the data on which Johnson based his assertion, the results show that cohabiting and married victims of violence are equally likely to report experiencing SCV and IT. Moreover, cohabitors have higher odds of experiencing SCV and IT compared to their counterparts living in a marital union. These marital status differences are explained by selection and relationship factors theorized to account for them. Although the SCV- IT typology does appear to shed light on gender differences, the results of this study suggest that, where relevant, researchers using this typology should not neglect risk factors derived from theories for understanding intimate partner violence (IPV).

Attitudes Toward Domestic Violence: A Cultural Perspective

Author: Wallach, Helene S1; Weingram, Ziv; Avitan, Orli1 University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel, helenwa@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810611443?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the effect of acculturation on the attitudes held by Ethiopian Jews in Israel toward domestic violence (DV). The study findings revealed the following: Ethiopians who immigrated to Israel (n = 31) held more lenient attitudes toward DV than Israeli born Jews (n = 62), which supported the hypothesis that culture influences attitudes toward DV; in addition, Ethiopians born in Israel (n = 29) held attitudes closer to those of Israeli-born Jews who were not from Ethiopian origin, thus supporting the hypothesis that integration into the host country results in changes in DV attitudes. These are important findings due to the extremely high number of DV episodes among immigrant populations in general and Ethiopian Jews living in Israel in particular. This study may provide optimism in that it is probable that the younger generation will prove to be less violent than the first-generation immigrants. Perhaps one conclusion that can be drawn is the importance of expediting the integration process of the second-generation Ethiopian Jews in Israel.

Intimate Partner Abuse and Women's Employment: A Study on Afro-Trinidadian Women

Author: Hadeed, Linda1; Lee, Yeon-Shim1 Behavioral Sciences, University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad, West Indies

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758125394?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the impact of intimate partner abuse on women's employment in Trinidad and Tobago. Using a qualitative method and data from in-depth interviews with 17 Afro-Trinidadian women, the study found that 12 women were able to seek and maintain employment without interference from their abusers. Data analyses suggest that abusers monitored the women's work schedules and manipulated them into using their earnings for household expenses. While five women were unemployed, only two were prevented from working despite severe economic need. The findings also show that three women were harassed or stalked at their workplaces. Three women who told their employers or co-workers about the abuse received mixed responses. Fourteen women hid their abuse from co-workers because of shame or fear of stigmatization. The findings further highlight the need for workplace interventions for dealing with partner abuse. Implications for research, practice and policy are also discussed.

Reasons Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence Seek Assistance From Employee Assistance Programs

Author: Pollack, Keshia M1; Cummiskey, Chris; Krotki, Karol; Salomon, Michele; Dickin, Allison; Gray, Whitney Austin; Grisso, Jeane Ann1 Department of Health Policy and Management, Center for Injury Research and Policy, Education and Research Center for Occupational Safety and Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758128438?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research explores the reasons that employed adult women (N=760), living in the United States, who experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) contacted the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Women who contacted their EAP most often sought counseling or referrals for mental health or legal services. Most women who contacted their EAP did so because they did not know where to turn for help, gained access to an EAP, or were encouraged by a workplace manager/supervisor of family/friend. These results suggest that EAPs should work closely with workplace supervisors/managers and employees to provide information regarding EAP access and available resources.

Marshalling the Evidence: Using Intersectionality in the Domestic Violence Frame

Author: Nixon, Jennifer; Humphreys, Cathy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743061994?accountid=14925

Abstract: The movement against domestic violence has achieved a number of successes in challenging violence between intimate or formerly intimate partners and in providing services for survivors of domestic abuse. It has, in effect, mainstreamed the message that domestic violence is common and dangerous to women of all backgrounds. In this article, we look closely at statistical evidence around prevalence, gender, ethnicity, and poverty to investigate this claim. We argue that the framing of domestic violence could be advanced through the use of a social movement frame that draws on issues of intersectionality. Adapted from the source document.

Frontline Worker Responses to Domestic Violence Disclosure in Public Welfare Offices

Author: Lindhorst, Taryn; Casey, Erin; Meyers, Marcia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753991741?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although substantial numbers of women seeking Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) report domestic violence, few receive mandated services through the Family Violence Option (FVO). This study used transcripts of interviews between welfare caseworkers and their clients to identify and classify the responses made by workers to client disclosures of abuse and to assess the match or mismatch of these responses with FVO policy requirements. Only 22 of 782 client interviews involved the disclosure of abuse to the welfare caseworker. A typology of worker responses was created, from least to most engaged. This typology shows that only half of those who disclosed abuse received assistance from the welfare worker, despite policy mandates that clients receive information on TANF waivers and community resources. This study suggests that problems with implementation of the FVO reflect a systemic reluctance to address issues of violence with women rather than problems of individual workers.

Social Worker's Role in Helping the Church Address Intimate Partner Violence: An Invisible Problem

Author: McAllister, John Michael1; Roberts-Lewis, Amelia1 Holland's United Methodist Church, 9433 Ten Ten Rd., Raleigh, NC 27603, Tel: 919-772-5294 johnmcallister@unc.edu

Abstract: Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), threatens the well-being, security, and lives of millions of religious women each year. Women of every class, color, and religious affiliation are affected by the consequences of IPV, which are numerous, complex, and far-reaching. Unfortunately, the church is not always a safe place to talk about the realities of IPV, and religious women may be more vulnerable than non-religious women when abused. Due to longstanding beliefs that are harmful to victims, misinformation about the nature of domestic abuse, propensities to avoid legal action, or misunderstandings about the seriousness of IPV, clergy and other religious leaders have too often failed to provide faithful help to women in abusive relationships. Despite these shortfalls, the Church has numerous strengths that can provide support and empower these women. In this article, the authors explore the nature and effects of violence perpetrated against women, the ways in which the Church and its leaders have inadvertently contributed to this problem, and ways in which social workers can be used to assist pastors and other religious leaders to best serve survivors of IPV. Adapted from the source document.

More Responsibilities, Less Control: Understanding the Challenges and Difficulties Involved in Mothering in the Context of Domestic Violence

Author: Lapierre, Simon11 Centre de recherche interdisciplinaire sur la violence familiale & la violence faite aux femmes, Ecole de service social, U Montreal s.lapierre@umontreal.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758127805?accountid=14925

Abstract: Limited work has looked specifically at the issue of mothering in the context of domestic violence, and there is a particular dearth of empirical work that focuses on women's experiences of mothering in these circumstances. This article reports the findings of a study that investigated women's experiences of mothering in the context of domestic violence, and is concerned with the challenges and difficulties that abused women face in regard to their mothering. The author argues that these challenges and difficulties arise from the interaction between the particular context created by the violence and the broader institution of motherhood. More specifically, the article focuses on the following two elements: the women's increased sense of responsibility in regard to their children and their loss of control over their mothering. The findings suggest that in order to support these women, professionals need to understand the challenges and difficulties that they face, and to be mindful not to exacerbate the women's sense of responsibility and loss of control.

Continuum of Conflict and Control: A Conceptualization of Intimate Partner Violence Typologies

Author: Carlson, Ryan G1; Jones, K Dayle1 University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA, rcarlson@mail.ucf.edu rcarlson@mail.ucf.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992486?accountid=14925

Abstract: Typologies of intimate partner violence were developed to describe the heterogeneity of abusive men. They contrast with the traditional feminist ideology of abuser etiology that holds all violence is the result of power and control. Over the past 15 years, a large body of knowledge about typologies has amassed, mostly in sociology journals. Thus, very little typology research has been published in counseling journals. This article synthesizes empirically based typological research and introduces the continuum of conflict and control--a conceptual training model to help couples counselors understand the differences among violence within relationships.

Narratives of Suffering of South Asian Immigrant Survivors of Domestic Violence

Author: Kallivayalil, Diya11 Cambridge Health Alliance/Harvard Medical School, diyajk@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811163231?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the narratives of suffering expressed by a group of South Asian immigrant survivors of domestic violence who accessed a mental health clinic in New York City. These accounts illustrate women's own perceptions of their suffering and symptoms and provide a window into the South Asian immigrant community's ideologies and moral domains regarding gender, violence, and sickness, as well as how individuals vary in their endorsement of these ideologies. The women's narratives illustrate how migration and culture interact with the deeply personal experience of suffering caused by domestic and sexual violence.

Juxtaposing Beliefs and Reality: Prevalence Rates of Intimate Partner Violence and Attitudes to Violence and Gender Roles Reported by New Zealand Women

Author: Fanslow, Janet1; Robinson, Elizabeth; Crengle, Sue; Perese, Lana1 University of Auckland, New Zealand j.fanslow@auckland.ac.nz

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/754035142?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study documents the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) for four ethnic groups and explores ethnic-specific differences and similarities in women's attitudes. Data are from a cross-sectional survey of 2,674 ever-partnered women aged 18 to 64 years. High rates of IPV among all ethnic groups reinforce the need to retain and expand current prevention and intervention efforts. Violence was not regarded as normative for any ethnic group. All women, but Pacific and Asian women in particular, would benefit from interventions that reinforce women's acceptance of seeking and utilizing outside intervention in cases of partner maltreatment.

Association Between Intimate Partner Violence and Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Population-Based Study in Nicaragua

Author: Becker-Dreps, Sylvia1; Morgan, Douglas; Pena, Rodolfo; Cortes, Loreto; Martin, Christopher F; Valladares, Eliette1 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, sbd@unc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811035783?accountid=14925

Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disabling functional gastrointestinal disorder, which serves as a model for abdominal pain syndromes. An association between intimate partner violence and IBS has been shown among White women in the industrialized world. To determine whether this relationship transcends cultural boundaries, we conducted a population-based, cross-sectional survey in Nicaragua using the innovative Health and Demographic Surveillance System in the Leon province. Women who had experienced physical intimate partner violence had significantly increased risk of IBS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.35, 3.21), as did those who had experienced sexual intimate partner violence (OR = 2.85; 95% CI = 1.45, 5.59).
