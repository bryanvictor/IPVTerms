Abstract: This article discusses the results of an exploratory study to identify facilitating factors and barriers for practice self-efficacy with battered women. Based on self-efficacy theory, personal factors such as professional experience, academic preparation, personal experience, and continuing education training were explored with a random sample of licensed and degreed professional social workers. Professional experience (b=.61; t=9.54, p=.000) and academic preparation (b=.26; t=4.29, p=.000) were the strongest predictors of self-efficacy. These findings suggest that to advance the capacity of social workers to respond to domestic violence, social work education, practitioners, and researchers have a number of important steps available to take.

Addressing the Problem of Domestic Violence: How Far Have We Come?

Author: Pyles, Loretta1; Postmus, Judy L1 School Social Welfare, U Kansas, Lawrence lpyles@ku.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61496578?accountid=14925

Abstract: The social work profession has a complex & arguably problematic history in relation to the problem of domestic violence. Through a review of abstracts of social work articles published from 1985 to 2000, the authors sought to determine whether anything has changed since Davis's (1987) seminal study regarding the way in which the profession addresses the problem of domestic violence. The findings indicate that although researchers have done a good job of listening to the voices of battered women, there has been scant theorizing in the literature about the sexist origins of the problem. 44 References.

Wife Abuse in the Countries of the Former Yugoslavia

Author: Copic, Sanja11 Instit Criminological & Sociological Research, Belgrade

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60490349?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper contains some of the most important results obtained from surveys on domestic violence in Serbia & Macedonia, as well as from a survey on violence against women in the Federation of Bosnia & Herzegovina. These surveys have confirmed the results of other research showing that wife abuse is one of the most serious yet at the same time most hidden forms of victimization. It represents the manifestation of power & control over the victim, leading to a loss of trust & a threat to safety. Bearing that in mind, the aim of this paper is to examine the prevalence, structure & some features of wife abuse in the postwar societies of the former Yugoslavia, based on an analysis of the results of these surveys, with particular emphasis on the impact of the economic crisis & war on this phenomenon. 29 References.

Towards Understanding Domestic Violence: Reflections on Research and the 'Domestic Violence and Minoritization' Project

Author: Pratt, Rebekah1; Burman, Erica; Chantler, Khatidja1 Sub-Dept Clinical Health Psychology, University Coll London, UK Rebekahjpratt@hotmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60465551?accountid=14925

Abstract: Presents key findings of the "Domestic Violence & Minoritization: Supporting Women to Independence" project carried out from Sept 2001 to July 2002 in Manchester, England. The study addressed issues of minoritization & domestic violence by examining the views of abuse survivors & service providers. The term, "minoritization," is used to describe how unequal power relations between minority & majority groups are revealed in systems/structures that perpetuate privilege, especially structure barriers & complex dynamics that keep women in abusive situations. Minoritization is seen as a way to discuss broad political/social processes that reinforce the consequences of minority group identification. Specific issues discussed include how domestic violence is conceptualized; structural barriers to services or independence; cultural issues that serve as barriers to services; the impact of domestic violence on children; the difficult transition from an abusive relationship to independence; & support groups for women who have experienced domestic violence. The critical importance of research & practice in the area of domestic violence is discussed. 6 References. J. Lindroth

RECOGNIZING AND REMEDYING THE HARM OF BATTERING: A CALL TO CRIMINALIZE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

Author: Tuerkheimer, Deborah

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60291934?accountid=14925

Abstract: Tuerkheimer explores the rupture between women's experiences of battering and the remediation offered by the criminal law. She concludes that statutory descriptions of battering are inapt and require an overhaul to capture the practice of domestic violence.

Elder Abuse: Spouse/Intimate Partner Abuse and Family Violence among Elders

Author: Lundy, Marta; Grossman, Susan F

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60524246?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the experiences of 1,057 victims of domestic violence, age sixty-five & older who sought refuge, support & services from domestic violence programs between 1990 & 1995 in a large mid-western state. Specifically, the various circumstances of these elders in relation to age, gender, disability, types of abuse, relationship to the abuser, source of referral, & service needs are described. Although it is generally considered unusual for women over sixty who are victims of violence to seek services through domestic violence programs, this study substantiates that at least some elders who are victims of violence do so. The implications of the findings related to the unique needs of this population are discussed. 4 Tables, 29 References. Adapted from the source document.

Dating Violence: A Qualitative Analysis of Mexican American Youth's Views

Author: Black, Beverly M1; Weisz, Arlene N1 School Social Work, Wayne State U, Detroit, MI

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61561534?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study reports the findings of focus groups examining the thoughts & attitudes of Mexican American youth about dating violence. Youth in the focus groups expressed concern about the wide spread use of violence, & many reported the common occurrences of violent behaviors in their lives. Moreover, the youth voiced the acceptance of the use of violence in many situations especially when violence is used to retaliate for a peer's lack of respect or infidelity. Males expressed a willingness to intervene on behalf of female friends who were victimized by violence. The males reported that they turned to friends for assistance when they were confronted with violence. Females involved in relationship violence stated that they preferred to turn to their brothers for assistance. Implications for developing culturally sensitive prevention programming are discussed. 1 Table, 50 References. Adapted from the source document.

Adolescent Dating Violence on School Campuses

Author: Ely, Gretchen11 Coll Social Work, U Kentucky, Lexington gretchen.ely@uky.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61518447?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper reviews the adolescent dating violence literature in order to synthesize the risk factors that are associated with dating violence in school-aged adolescents. A review of the adolescent dating violence literature indicates that risk factors occur in three domains: individual, familial, & societal. Research has shown that up to 43% of students report dating violence occurring on school grounds. School social workers & other school personnel must develop intervention programs based on empirical evidence to prevent adolescent dating violence on school campuses. In addition, schools must implement policies to protect victims from such violence. 60 References. Adapted from the source document.

Battering and the Poverty Trap

Author: Brush, Lisa D11 Dept Sociology, U Pittsburgh, PA lbrush@pitt.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61557648?accountid=14925

Abstract: Structured interviews with women on welfare (n = 40) reveal the costs of taking a beating. Thirty-five percent of respondents reported having been physically abused by their current or most recent intimate partner. Compared with their peers, physically abused women earned less, worked fewer weeks, & more frequently worked part-time involuntarily. Women whose partners sabotaged their work effort experienced more hardships associated with poverty than did other respondents. The causal connections between the dual traps of poverty & abuse are complex. Irrespective of the direction of causality, battering & poverty diminish the lives of a significant proportion of women on welfare. 62 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: A political economy of domestic violence situates domestic violence within a cultural-historical context to reveal the intersection between domestic violence & (1) the organization of the polity, (2) the arrangement of the economy, & (3) the dominant familial ideology expressed normatively through state policies. The combination of these components makes visible the articulation between domestic violence & an often invisible set of conditions in US society -- structural inequality as shaped by 'family values' & the logic of state-economy relations. The analysis of the political economy of battering as it intersects with poverty & globalization highlights the contours of "the battering state.". 74 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Buzy, Wendy Marsh1; McDonald, Renee; Jouriles, Ernest N; Swank, Paul R; Rosenfield, David; Shimek, Jennifer S; Corbitt-Shindler, Deborah1 Dept Psychology, U Houston, TX

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60518944?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research examined the relation between female adolescents' general alcohol use & their experience of relationship violence. This relation was examined both cross-sectionally & longitudinally, controlling for the proximal (ie, situational) effects of alcohol use. One hundred & six female high school students reported on their experiences of physical violence & sexual coercion by boyfriends, general patterns of alcohol use, victimization experiences while drinking, & hypothesized covariates including demographic & relationship variables & illicit drug use. Variables were assessed at 2 time points 4 months apart. Results indicated that general alcohol use was related to victimization both cross-sectionally & longitudinally, but different findings emerged for different forms of victimization (physical-only victimization vs both physical & sexual victimization). 4 Tables, 2 Figures, 37 References. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence as an Obstacle to Employment among Mothers Affected by Welfare Reform

Author: Riger, Stephanie1; Staggs, Susan L; Schewe, Paul1 U Illinois, Chicago sriger@uic.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60504208?accountid=14925

Abstract: Welfare policies in the US now make benefits contingent on employment outside the home. Yet violence from intimate partners & aspects of the mothering role may impede low-income women's ability to sustain employment. This article presents results of a longitudinal study conducted over a three-year period of 965 IL mothers who had received public assistance. Results suggest that recent (but not past) intimate partner violence is associated with women working fewer months. Associations over time between obstacles to employment & women's ability to maintain work highlight the need for longitudinal studies of employment among low-income women. 3 Tables, 50 References. Adapted from the source document.

Religion, State Power, and Domestic Violence in Muslim Societies: A Framework for Comparative Analysis

Author: Hajjar, Lisa11 Law & Society Program, U California, Santa Barbara

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60103713?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article focuses on the issue of domestic violence in Muslim societies in the Middle East, Africa, & Asia. The analytical framework is comparative, emphasizing four factors & the interplay among them: shari'a (Islamic law), state power, intrafamily violence, & struggles over women's rights. The comparative approach historicizes the problem of domestic violence & impunity to consider the impact of transnational legal discourses (Islamism & human rights) on "local" struggles over rights & law. The use of shari'a creates some commonalities in gender & family relations in Muslim societies, notably the sanctioning & maintenance of male authority over female relatives. However, the most important issue for understanding domestic violence & impunity is the relationship between religion & state power. This relationship takes three forms: communalization, in which religious law is separate from the national legal regime; nationalization, in which the state incorporates religious law into the national legal regime; & theocratization, in which the national legal regime is based on religious law. 139 References.

Screening Risks for Intimate Partner Violence and Primary Care Settings: Implications for Future Abuse

Author: Ross, Julie1; Walther, Virginia; Epstein, Irwin1 Dept Community & Preventive Medicine, Mount Sinai School Medicine, New York, NY julier7725@msn.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61556701?accountid=14925

Abstract: Most health care intervention models for intimate partner violence (IPV) are crisis driven & targeted to survivors of injury following episodes of physical violence. Knowledge about anticipatory & preventive approaches with women who are at risk for abuse is scarce, limiting professionals' ability to respond fully & effectively to this problem. This paper describes a retrospective, practice-based research study of social work interventions in two hospital-based primary care practices. A total of 431 female patients completed a self-administered questionnaire developed for the early detection of IPV risk factors during routine health care visits. The study showed surprisingly high rates of multiple risk markers in an urban primary care population whose medical presentations ordinarily would not raise provider suspicion about abuse. Findings confirmed the willingness of primary care populations to freely partake in routine screening & support the value of early identification & intervention with populations at risk. Practice implications are discussed. 3 Tables, 1 Figure, 41 References. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60537464?accountid=14925

Abstract: Today many developed & developing countries solve the problem of violence against children in a family. This phenomenon of violence against children becomes more frequent in Lithuania. The consequences of the violence experienced in a family influence the socialisation process of a child in his/her closest & further social environment. The article deals with the reasons for violence in a family & its consequences upon further physical, psychic & emotional evolution of a child; it also analyses the problems of social adaptation of these children in a secondary school. 7 Tables, 4 Figures, 25 References.

THE PREVALENCE AND INCIDENCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN OLDER WOMEN IN PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES: WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO SCREEN

Author: Regan, S; Gothelf, E; Zink, T; Rinto, B; Et al

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61341362?accountid=14925

Abstract: An abstract of a study by Regan et al examining the prevalence and incidence of domestic violence (DV) in older women in primary care clinics is presented. DV is a problem for women over 55, with lower rates of physical abuse and similar rates of emotional abuse to those of younger women. Health care and social service providers are encouraged to screen all women, especially those with conditions more frequently associated with DV.

INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE OF MID-LIFE AND OLDER WOMEN IN RURAL AREAS

Author: Teaster, P; Dugar, T

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61344983?accountid=14925

Abstract: An abstract of a study that examines intimate partner violence of mid-life and older women in rural areas from the perspective of those who provide service, as well as from the perspective of Appalachian women over 50 year by Teaster and Dugar is presented. The findings include a lack of resources available to mid-life and older women; a lack of training for professional staff on unique issues of the age group; and a lack of community support options for the women.

Prevalence and Chronicity of Dating Violence Among a Sample of African-American University Students

Author: Bougere, Alan A1; Rowley, Lucille M; Lee, Glenell M1 Tulane University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61743178?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study investigated African-American college students in the Southern United States as a part of the International Dating Violence Consortium. The study used the Personal and Relationship Profile (PRP) and the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2) to study factors important in defining dating violence among African-American college students. The sample was comprised of college students from three historically black universities and one historically white university from the southern United States recruited from social work classes in the spring and summer 2002 semesters. Of those, 228 students identified themselves as African-American. The findings indicate that this sample of African-American college students in the southern United States looks similar to Euro-American samples when it comes to experiencing different forms of dating violence. Adapted from the source document.

Abject Economics: The Effects of Battering and Violence on Women's Work and Employability

Author: Moe, Angela M1; Bell, Myrtle P1 Western Michigan U, Kalamazoo

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60476976?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on the effects of battering on women's lives has focused on poverty, homelessness, & welfare receipt, often centering on women who are uneducated or undereducated. The authors analyze how battering impacts the work & employability of women from various employment levels & backgrounds. Data were obtained through qualitative interviews with 19 residents of a domestic violence shelter, some of whom had obtained substantial education & built solid & lucrative careers prior to being abused. The women described instances in which battering had obstructed their ability to find work, maintain employment, & use their wages to establish greater economic independence & safety. 76 References.

Acculturation, Drinking, and Intimate Partner Violence among Hispanic Couples in the United States: A Longitudinal Study

Author: Caetano, Raul; Ramisetty-Mikler, Suhasini; McGrath, Christine

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810385509?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the 5-year association between acculturation, drinking, and maleto-female partner violence and female-to-male partner violence among Hispanic couples in the United States. A national representative sample of Hispanic couples 18 years of age or older was interviewed in 1995 and 2000. Both members of the couple were independently interviewed. Differences in prevalence rates of male-to-female partner violence and female-to-male partner violence, incidence, and recurrence across acculturation groups are not significant. Drinking is associated with acculturation among women. Couples with mixed acculturation level (high-medium) are less at risk for maleto-female partner violence. An increase of five standard drinks per week in men's drinking decreases the risk of female-to-male partner violence by 10%. Acculturation level at Time 1 is not associated with male-to-female partner violence and female-to-male partner violence status 5 years later.

Comparing Women and Men Arrested for Domestic Violence: A Preliminary Report

Author: Busch, Amy L1; Rosenberg, Mindy S1 Clinical Science Program, Dept Psychology, U California, Berkeley abusch@socrates.berkeley.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61518573?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study uses criminal justice data to compare women & men arrested for domestic violence on their levels of violence, reported victimization, general criminality, & substance abuse. Participants were 45 women & 45 men convicted of domestic violence between 1996 & 1998. Results indicate that women were less likely than men to have a history of domestic violence offenses & nonviolent crimes. They were also more likely to report that they had been injured or victimized by their partner at the time of their arrest. However, in other ways, women & men were similar: they were equally likely to have used severe violence & inflicted severe injuries on their victims; to have previously committed violence against non-intimates; & to have been using drugs or alcohol at the time of their arrest. The implications for treatment for women arrested for domestic violence are discussed. 2 Tables, 27 References. Adapted from the source document.

A Path Model of Risk Factors for Intimate Partner Violence among Couples in the United States

Author: Schafer, John1; Caetano, Raul; Cunradi, Carol B1 Coll Nursing, U Cincinnati, OH john.schafer@uc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60483985?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study was designed to identify the impact of drinking problems, impulsivity, & a history of childhood physical abuse on both male-to-female (MFIPV) & female-to-male intimate partner violence (FMIPV). The data were collected in 1995 from a representative national sample of couples living in the contiguous 48 states. Using a multistage probability sampling design, face-to-face interviews were conducted in respondents' homes, privately with each member of 1,635 couples. A complex path model building on earlier work was tested for African American, Hispanic, & White couples separately. Multiple-group path analysis demonstrated that impulsivity, alcohol problems, & childhood physical abuse were differentially associated with reports of MFIPV & FMIPV as a function of ethnicity. This study suggests that a history of being physically harmed by parental figures during childhood, impulsivity, & drinking problems are all risk factors for intimate partner violence in the general household population in the United States. 2 Tables, 3 Figures, 51 References.

Adolescent Dating Violence: Do Adolescents Follow in Their Friends', or Their Parents', Footsteps?

Author: Arriaga, Ximena B1; Foshee, Vangie A1 Dept Psychological Sciences, Purdue U, West Lafayette, IN arriaga@purdue.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60488652?accountid=14925

Abstract: Past research suggests that adolescents whose parents are violent toward one another should be more likely to experience dating violence. Having friends in violent relationships also may increase the odds of dating violence. The authors examined which antecedent, friend dating violence or interparental violence, if either, is more strongly predictive of own dating violence perpetration & victimization. Five hundred & twenty-six adolescents (eighth & ninth graders) completed self-report questionnaires on two occasions over a 6-month period. Consistent with hypotheses, friend dating violence & interparental violence each exhibited unique cross-sectional associations with own perpetration & victimization. However, only friend violence consistently predicted later dating violence. The authors explored influence versus selection processes to explain the association between friend & own dating violence. 2 Tables, 1 Figure, 40 References. [Copyright 2004 Sage Publications, Inc.]

The Role of Alcohol Use in Intimate Partner Violence and Nonintimate Partner Violence

Author: Thompson, Martie P1; Kingree, J B1 Dept Public Health Sciences, Clemson U, SC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60491577?accountid=14925

Abstract: Alcohol use is a risk factor for violent victimization in general, & intimate partner violence in particular. However, there has been limited empirical attention on whether alcohol use is more often associated with IPV or non-IPV offenses. Further, few studies on the association between alcohol use & victimization have assessed for incident-specific alcohol use, or examined both victim & perpetrator alcohol use. We used data from the National Violence against Women Survey to determine if incident-specific alcohol use is more prevalent in IPV or non-IPV physical assaults, & to determine if the association varied by gender. Results indicated that among women, perpetrator alcohol use was twice as likely in IPV incidents than in non-IPV incidents, but among men, perpetrator alcohol use was four times less likely in IPV incidents than in non-IPV incidents. Our results highlight the important role of gender in understanding the association between alcohol use & victimization risk. 2 Tables, 39 References. Adapted from the source document.

Supporting Community Solutions to Family Violence

Author: Taylor, Judy1; Cheers, Brian; Weetra, Colin; Gentle, Ian1 Spencer Gulf Rural Health School judy.taylor@unisa.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61535558?accountid=14925

Abstract: Competing discourses have always figured prominently in policy debates about violence against women & children. Legislation & services to address it have largely been developed from theory & empirical knowledge of domestic violence occurring in intimate relationships. Knowledge from an Indigenous perspective about family violence, embedded in a context of colonization & involving a broader range of relationships, has been less influential. One of the consequences of this is that when Indigenous communities identify solutions to address family violence holistically, these solutions are difficult to implement. Research with a remote South Australian Aboriginal community, looking for ways to reduce the level of family violence, resulted in new understandings of it. Linking issues of economic deprivation, dispossession & the breaking down of culture, the community devised a holistic community development approach to reduce family violence. This paper identifies the waves of understanding about family violence & argues that community-initiated solutions must be supported by policy & funding options based on an Indigenous understanding of family violence. 24 References.

Author: Hazen, Andrea L1; Connelly, Cynthia D; Kelleher, Kelly; Landsverk, John; Barth, Richard1 Child & Adolescent Services Research Center, Children's Hospital & Health Center, San Diego, CA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61548169?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence & correlates of intimate partner violence among female caregivers of children reported to child protective services. Method: Data were derived from the National Survey of Child & Adolescent Well-Being, a national probability study of children investigated for child abuse & neglect in the United States. Caregivers were interviewed about demographic characteristics, mental health, substance use, & physical violence by a partner. Results: The lifetime & past year prevalence of intimate partner violence was 44.8 & 29.0%, respectively. Caregiver major depression & history of prior reports of child maltreatment were strongly associated with violence against women. Conclusions: The findings highlight the need for effective screening & identification of intimate partner violence in families in which child maltreatment has occurred. 4 Tables, 1 Figure, 49 References.

Risky Lifestyles and Dating Violence: A Theoretical Test of Violent Victimization

Author: Gover, Angela R11 Center Studies Criminology & Law, U Florida, Gainesville agover@crim.ufl.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60549732?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research consistently indicates that there are numerous risk factors associated with dating violence. Few studies, however, developed theoretical explanations for the prevalence of dating victimization. In this study victimization theories were tested that suggested risk-taking behaviors (i.e., drug abuse, alcohol abuse, driving under the influence, & sexual promiscuity) mediated the effects of social ties & emotional states on the likelihood of violent victimization in adolescent dating relationships. This model was tested using a representative sample of public high school students in South Carolina. The results confirm theoretical predictions & indicate the effects of social ties on dating victimization occur indirectly, through their antecedent influence on risk taking. These findings, therefore, lend support for a lifestyles theory explanation of violent victimization in adolescent dating relationships. The implications of this research for theory & social policy are discussed. 2 Tables, 1 Figure, 1 Appendix, 62 References. [Copyright 2004 Elsevier Ltd.]

Finding Common Ground in the Study of Child Maltreatment, Youth Violence, and Adult Domestic Violence

Author: Daro, Deborah1; Edleson, Jeffrey L; Pinderhughes, Howard1 c/o Edleson -- School Social Work, U Minnesota, St. Paul

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60484239?accountid=14925

Abstract: For several decades, we have witnessed a surge in public policies aimed at ending child maltreatment, youth violence, & adult domestic violence. Commensurate with this increased interest has been a growing body of research on each issue's etiology, affected population, & the public policy & prevention impacts. Even a cursory review of the literature suggests a number of commonalities across these forms of violence. As such, it seems timely & prudent to craft a research framework that facilitates the identification & dissemination of practice & policy innovations that can address all three concerns. This article articulates an overarching framework to guide researchers in better identifying common avenues of study. After summarizing the commonalities found across the three areas, the authors identify crosscutting issues that have particular relevance for advancing our understanding of violence & its effects on personal & social interactions. 54 References.

Advancing Prevention Research on Child Abuse, Youth Violence, and Domestic Violence: Emerging Strategies and Issues

Author: Guterman, Neil B11 School Social Work, Columbia U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61500933?accountid=14925

Abstract: Prevention research on the related problems of child abuse, youth violence, & domestic violence has grown at an accelerating pace in recent years. In this context, a set of shared methodological issues has emerged as investigators seek to advance the interpersonal violence prevention knowledge base. This article considers some of the persistent methodological issues in these areas & points out emerging research strategies that are forging advances in garnering valid, rigorous, & useful knowledge to prevent interpersonal violence. Research issues & emerging strategies in three key domains of prevention research are considered, including complexities in validly conceptualizing & measuring varying forms of violence as specific targets for preventive intervention, research issues & strategies designed to reliably predict & identify future violence risk to be targeted by preventive intervention, & research issues & emerging strategies in the application of empirical methods to forge specific advances in preventive intervention strategies themselves. 80 References.

The Nexus of Domestic Violence and Poverty. Resilience in Women's Anxiety

Author: Williams, Stacey L1; Mickelson, Kristin D1 Kent State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811126710?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study extends past research by examining the mediating role of cognitive and social resilience in the domestic violence-anxiety relation. Mediation is tested on a sample of 100 impoverished women from the Women's Health Outcomes in Urban and Rural Environments (Women's HOUR) Study. Regression analysis and structural equation modeling provide consistent support for the proposed model: poor women's violence experience impairs support and self-esteem, which in turn influences their anxiety levels. Results demonstrate the dynamic role impaired resilience may play in the violence process, highlighting implications for research, practice, and policy at the nexus of violence and poverty.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61520087?accountid=14925

Abstract: The focus of this paper is on the author's multi-modal therapeutic practice with a 7-year-old boy referred to the Family Trauma Centre, following paramilitary assaults on his father. The work also addresses the boy's experience of domestic violence. The work is contextualized in terms of the "Peace Process" in Northern Ireland, including the establishment of the Family Trauma Centre as a response to the needs of victims of the Troubles. A rationale for working with children using a multi-modal approach is presented. 6 Figures, 15 References. Adapted from the source document.

Severe Domestic Violence and Child Maltreatment: Considering Child Physical Abuse, Neglect, and Failure to Protect

Author: Hartley, Carolyn C11 School Social Work, U Iowa, Iowa City carolyn-hartley@uiowa.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61497677?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined differences between families in which less or more severe domestic violence & child maltreatment were present compared to families in which only child maltreatment was known to be present. Both child physical abuse & neglect were examined using a child maltreatment reports involving parental perpetrators. The study found a higher percentage of neglect, specifically lack of supervision, & less child physical abuse in the more severe domestic violence compared to the child maltreatment only & less severe domestic violence groups. More mothers were found responsible for lack of supervision & fewer fathers were responsible for child physical abuse in the severe domestic violence group. Child protection workers also reported a higher level of concern for cases involving domestic violence. However, a closer examination of the qualitative characteristics of the domestic violence cases revealed that quantitative findings do not accurately present the whole story. Both mothers & fathers engaged in serious acts of physical abuse against their children. In addition, many mothers were held responsible to 'failure to protect' their children from the father's domestic violence. Implications for child welfare practice & policy & future research directions are addressed. 4 Tables, 38 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This article suggests measures that should be taken to ensure, as much as possible, the safety of victims of domestic violence. Because victims & perpetrators of domestic violence will inevitably be attendees at parent education programs, such programs must be sensitive to the safety concerns of these victims. Only when victims of domestic violence are safe will their children be safe & able to benefit from what their parents learn at these education programs. This article concludes that, by weaving common-sense logistical, administrative, & curricular recommendations into the fabric of every parent education program, the safety of victims & children will be prioritized as it must be, while all attendees still receive the maximum benefit from these valuable programs.

Managing Domestic Violence Cases in Family Court Social Services in Israel

Author: Laufer, Hanna11 School Social Work, Faculty Social Welfare & Health Studies, Mt. Carmel, Haifa, Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61522347?accountid=14925

Abstract: The family courts in Israel provide social services. One of the more difficult issues that this service deals with is domestic violence. The present research evaluated management of referred cases to the Family Court Social Services, according to two criteria: reaching agreement & receiving treatment. Of 272 cases, 53% reached successful outcomes. Additional findings indicate that when the referral to the unit is made earlier, & if the marriage duration has been short, the probability of successful referral increases. The study also found that monitoring of cases referred to other agencies needs to be improved. 7 Tables, 37 References. Adapted from the source document.

Comprehensive Evaluation: A Holistic Approach to Evaluating Domestic Violence Offender Programmes

Author: Bowen, Erica1; Gilchrist, Elizabeth1 Postdoctoral Research Psychologist, Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, Departent of Community-Based Medicine, University of Bristol, 24 Tyndall Avenue, Bristol, BS8 1TQ, England

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810471810?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article argues that the focus on behavioural outcomes in evaluations of domestic violence offender programmes has been too narrow, and that a more holistic approach incorporating investigation of the psychological characteristics of offenders and treatment characteristics may be required to determine what works, for whom, and under what circumstances. To this end, one interpretation of a comprehensive evaluation framework is outlined. The article hypothesises the insights to be gained by assessing the contribution of several potential mediating variables of the treatment process in the evaluation of these programmes. These variables are the heterogeneity of treatment targets in the target population; motivation to change; programme integrity variables; and therapeutic factors. The article concludes that only by implementing theoretically informed, multifaceted evaluations will we move closer to understanding the process of successful rehabilitation.

A Cooperative Approach to Accountability: Manitoba's Family Violence Prevention Program

Author: Brown, Laura K1; Troutt, Elizabeth1 Dept Economics, U Manitoba, Winnipeg Lbrown@cc.umanitoba.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61511503?accountid=14925

Abstract: Can government's need for nonprofit accountability be accomplished without diminishing nonprofit organizations' ability to pursue their goals of responsiveness & flexibility? The conventional view argues that governments' accountability objectives conflict with nonprofits' objectives, implying that there must be some tradeoff. This article adopts the emerging alternative view in which the two parties' objectives are jointly pursued through a cooperative process. The analysis of a provincial funding program in Manitoba, Canada, presented here, provides evidence that such an approach is not only possible but also efficient. The program analyzed rests on a sustained cooperative process in which government officials & nonprofit managers jointly define goals & establish constraints. 23 References.

A Comparison of Men and Women Arrested for Domestic Violence: Who Presents the Greater Threat?

Author: Henning, Kris1; Feder, Lynette1 Portland State U, OR khenning@pdx.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61432821?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recent increases in the number of women arrested for domestic violence raise important questions about implementation of proarrest policies, equivalency of intimate partner aggression across genders, & management of female domestic violence offenders. This study compares demographic characteristics, criminal history variables, & the past domestic violence history of men (n = 5,578) & women (n = 1,126) arrested for domestic assault against a heterosexual intimate partner. Using victim reported information & data collected by local criminal justice agencies, we found that female arrestees were significantly less likely than males to have histories that warrant concern regarding the potential for future violence. Implications of these findings are discussed. 6 Tables, 50 References. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence in Hispanics in the Southeastern United States: A Survey and Needs Analysis

Author: Murdaugh, Carolyn1; Hunt, Salena; Sowell, Richard; Santana, Irma1 Coll Nursing, U South Carolina, Columbia carolyn.murdaugh@sc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61555450?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence is a significant health issue for Latinas in the US, with 54.9% reporting violent victimization. However, little is known about battering among Hispanic women in the southeast. The southeastern corridor, a rural area in search of cheap labor, is a magnet for undocumented agricultural workers. The purpose of this study was to describe domestic violence in Hispanic/Latino women in the southeastern US, including type & frequency of violence experienced, barriers to obtaining treatment, & services needed by women who have been abused. Hispanic women completed questionnaires developed from information from focus groups. Results indicate that domestic violence is a major health problem for women in the southeast & document previous findings as well as offer new insights about Hispanic women who have experienced domestic violence. Implications are discussed in terms of the need for community partnerships & interventions, as well as routine screening & crisis intervention. 3 Tables, 36 References.

Comparing Different Types of Child Abuse and Spouse Abuse Offenders

Author: Pittman, Joe F1; Lee, Chih-Yuan S1 Dept Human Development & Family Studies, Auburn U, AL joe.pittman@auburn.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61557900?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined differences in offenders' background characteristics, personal & interpersonal problems, & family climate between three types of child abuse offenders (neglecters, physical abusers, & psychological abusers) & two forms of spouse abuse offenders (physical abusers & psychological abusers) in two large samples (child abuse N = 2,910; spouse abuse; N = 7,035) of cases officially identified over a 8-year period (1988-1995) by the US Air Force Family Advocacy Program. Comparisons addressed demographic factors, personal & interpersonal problems, & aspects of family climate. Among child abusers, results supported the conclusion that types of child abuse varied with offender demographics & family climate factors. For spouse abusers, however, types of abuse were not as distinctly different in terms of the comparison variables. In general, therefore, for child abuse -- but not for spouse abuse -- findings challenge the view of abuse as a unitary phenomenon. 6 Tables, 33 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Role of Social Support in the Psychological Well-Being of African American Girls Who Experience Dating Violence Victimization

Author: Salazar, Laura F1; Wingood, Gina M; DiClemente, Ralph J; Lang, Delia L; Harrington, Kathy1 Rollins School Public Health, Atlanta, GA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61455372?accountid=14925

Abstract: The goals of this study were to test the relationship between dating violence victimization (ie, verbal, emotional, & physical abuse) & psychological well-being (ie, depressive symptomatology, self-esteem, & body image) among 522 African American girls, & to determine whether social support acted as a buffer of negative effects (moderator) or as an intervening factor (mediator) in the relationship between dating violence victimization & psychological well-being. Results from structural equation modeling indicated that dating violence victimization was associated with negative psychological outcomes. Although social support did not moderate this relationship, it served as a mediator of the relationship between dating violence victimization & psychological well-being. Dating violence programs for African American girls should consider how to incorporate family, church, & other networks in the community to foster support, & allow adolescent girls to discuss their abusive experiences in a nonblaming environment. If programs are able to buoy girls who experience dating violence, then they may be able to ameliorate the associated negative psychological sequelae. 3 Tables, 1 Figure, 62 References.

The Influence of Gender and Ethnicity on Judgments of Culpability in a Domestic Violence Scenario

Author: Ferguson, Christopher J1; Negy, Charles1 c/o Negy -- Dept Psychology, U Central Florida, Orlando

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60544337?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using an experimental analog design, in this study we examined 503 European American, African American, & Latino undergraduate students' responses to a domestic violence scenario in which the ethnicity & gender of the perpetrator were manipulated. Results indicated that participants perceived perpetration of domestic assault significantly more criminal when committed by a man than when committed by a woman. That finding was robust across European Americans, African Americans, & Latinos & was expressed by both genders. Also, European American participants expressed significantly more criticism toward African American perpetrators of assault than they did toward European American & Latino perpetrators of the exact offense, suggestive of racial bias consistent with stereotypes about African Americans being excessively aggressive. Finally, Latino participants expressed significantly more sympathy toward women who assault their husbands than toward assaulting husbands. Implications of the findings are discussed. 6 Figures, 42 References. Adapted from the source document.

Rethinking Domestic Violence in Theory and Practice

Author: Chancer, Lynn S11 Dept Sociology & Anthropology, Fordham U, Bronx, NY chancer@fordham.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60484607?accountid=14925

Abstract: Drawing on the author's previous work, this article suggests that conceptual advantages result from envisioning domestic violence on a larger continuum of "normalized" to "extreme" sadomasochistic interactions (including gendered interactions that can also range from "ordinary" to "deviant" in how they are perceived). Thereafter, it may be harder to ignore how redressing social inequities involving gender as well as racial & class imbalances can amount, at least in terms of prevention, to anti-domestic-violence measures of one important kind. More concretely, proceeding from the assumption that domestic violence remains disturbingly common (even though its exact scope is difficult to ascertain), this article contrasts how this social problem would best be approached in theory & how it often continues to be dealt with in practice. In making this comparison, a cursory review of recent policy developments in this area, from mandatory arrest policies & laws (& the criticisms these have engendered) to more recent interest in restorative justice & collaborative empowerment, is presented & incorporated into the paper's larger argument. 32 References.

Dissatisfaction with Relationship Power and Dating Violence Perpetration by Men and Women

Author: Kaura, Shelby A1; Allen, Craig M1 Dept Human Development & Family Studies, Iowa State U, Ames

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60484666?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study focuses on the relationship between an individual's dissatisfaction with the level of power they have in their dating relationships, parental violence they experienced during their childhoods, & their dating violence perpetration. A sample of 352 male & 296 female undergraduate college students completed a dating violence survey, including selected subscales from the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2) & the Relationship Power Scale. Findings show that relationship power dissatisfaction is associated with the use of violence in dating relationships for both men & women. However, parental violence emerged as an even stronger predictor of dating violence perpetration. Findings also indicate that male perpetration of dating violence is related to mother's violence, whereas female perpetration of dating violence is related to father's violence. The results indicate the importance of including gender in the study of dating violence perpetration. 3 Tables, 35 References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2004.]

Conjoint Interventions for Adult Victims and Children of Domestic Violence: A Program Evaluation

Author: Sullivan, Michael1; Egan, Marcia; Gooch, Michael1 U Tennessee

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61507858?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study documented the evaluation of a 9-week group intervention program designed to address the needs of both abused mothers & their children who have witnessed violence. The intervention was designed to increase parenting skills, address the needs of both parents & children regarding increasing coping abilities & safety planning skills, & decrease the effects of postviolence stress. Parents & children were divided into groups based on clinical cutoff scores for analysis. Overall, the group intervention was effective in reducing blame & trauma symptoms. Parents generally perceived the intervention more helpful for their children than for themselves, but scores indicated that parents' feelings of isolation, stress levels, & health problems decreased significantly at posttest. Practice implications suggest this group intervention is most effective with children who enter the program with behavior scores above the clinical cutoff scores. 3 Tables, 34 References.

Author: Bledsoe, Linda K1; Yankeelov, Pamela A; Barbee, Anita P; Antle, Becky F1 Kent School Social Work, U Louisville

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61557429?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence is a pervasive, complex problem affecting the lives & health of a large percentage of women & children. This report provides data from an evaluation designed to address questions & concerns expressed about possible unintended effects of the mandatory reporting law on victims. Case reviews were completed on 631 adult protective service cases resulting from reports of intimate partner violence. Results indicate that following a report of suspected intimate partner violence made under Kentucky mandatory reporting law, all victims who could be located received at a minimum safety planning & information about community resources. Regardless of official case status, nearly half of all cases received services. 3 Tables, 1 Appendix, 24 References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2004.]

Relationship Violence and Women's Reactions to Male- and Female-Controlled HIV Prevention Methods

Author: Saul, Janet1; Moore, Janet; Murphy, Sheila T; Miller, Lynn C1 Division Violence Prevention, National Center Injury Prevention & Control, Centers Disease Control & Prevention, Atlanta, GA jsaul@cdc.gov

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61306157?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the association of relationship violence & preference for three HIV prevention methods among 104 African American & Hispanic women who were at some risk for heterosexual transmission of HIV & other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Women completed a brief questionnaire on sexual behaviors & history of relationship violence. All women then watched a video describing three HIV/STD prevention methods (male condoms, female condoms, & vaginal spermicide) that included a discussion of method effectiveness, how to use each method, & their benefits & limitations. Participants then completed a questionnaire assessing their reactions to each of the three HIV prevention methods discussed in the video. Women in violent relationships indicated less likelihood of using male condoms & greater likelihood of using female-controlled methods, particularly vaginal spermicide, than women in nonviolent relationships. In addition, a higher percentage of women in violent compared to nonviolent relationships expected their partners to prefer the vaginal spermicide & a lower percentage expected partners to prefer male condoms. These data suggest that the current focus on finding alternative HIV prevention methods for women in violent relationships is warranted & that a vaginal microbicidal product may be the preferred alternative for this group of women & their male partners. 3 Tables, 29 References.

From Respite to Transition: Women's Use of Domestic Violence Shelters in Rural New Mexico

Author: Krishnan, Satya P1; Hilbert, Judith C; McNeil, Keith; Newman, Isadore1 Dept Health Science, New Mexico State U, Las Cruces

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61518336?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women who flee violence in their intimate relationships often seek sanctuary at domestic violence shelters. Some return to their abusers, whereas others transition to separate living. This study used descriptive & cluster analyses to examine the differential needs of women who indicated they intended to return to their abusive partners vs those who did not. On the basis of the differences between these two groups, a preliminary model of prediction variables was developed to better understand the needs of those who do not specify their future plans after leaving the shelter. Findings revealed differences in the domains of mental health & help-seeking behaviors. Discussion focuses on the meaning & purpose of the shelter stay (ie, for respite or transition) & the role of shleters & their ideology in the decisions made by shelter staff & clients. 3 Tables, 3 Figures, 36 References.

Domestic Violence in Puerto Rican Gay Male Couples: Perceived Prevalence, Intergenerational Violence, Addictive Behaviors, and Conflict Resolution Skills

Author: Toro-Alfonso, Jose1; Rodriguez-Madera, Sheilla1 CUSEP/UPR, San Juan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61484481?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence (DV) is a pattern of behaviors in the context of an intimate relationship that can be manifested in emotional, physical, or sexual abuse. DV currently represents a social & a public health issue. This study is an effort to foster a better understanding of DV among same-sex couples. In it, the authors included the participation of 199 Puerto Rican gay males to identify prevalence of DV, violence in their family of origin, participants' addictive behaviors & exposure to violence at childhood, & their conflict resolution skills. Participants were relatively young, highly educated Puerto Rican gay men who reported a high level of domestic violence in their relationships. This violence was identified as emotional violence by 48% of the participants. This sample reported high levels of violence among their families of origin & low conflict resolution skills. 4 Tables, 3 Figures, 51 References.

Observations from Practice: Support Group Membership as a Process of Social Capital Formation among Female Survivors of Domestic Violence

Author: Larance, Lisa Young; Porter, Maryann Lane

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61549115?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores the authors' practice observations of female domestic violence survivors' journey from first agency contact to active participation in a support group process. The authors have witnessed female victims of domestic violence challenging the social isolation imposed by their dominant partners as they search for meaning in their lives. As practitioners, they have observed women building trustful relationships & establishing supportive networks during the group process. In this article, the authors suggest that the support group process facilitates trust & network formation indicative of social capital. 45 References.

Abstract: This study identified the trauma symptoms & life skill needs of 84 domestic violence victims from three domestic violence programs. Women completed two self-report tools: Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) & Occupational Self Assessment (OSA). Staff members participated in focus groups regarding their perceptions of the women's needs. Women scored within the clinical range on the Defensive Avoidance (39.8%), Intrusive Experiences (30.1%), & Tension Reduction Behavior (24.1%) clinical scales of the TSI. On the OSA, the groups' priorities differed although all demonstrated a desire to function more independently. Their mental health functioning & prioritization of needs differed based on their level of involvement with the service delivery system. Staff members believe women lack skills in the areas of money management, seeking & obtaining employment, locating permanent housing, independently completing self-care & home management activities, managing stress, & parenting. The findings indicate that both mental health & life skills needs must be addressed. 2 Tables, 40 References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2004.]

Battered and on Welfare: The Experiences of Women with the Family Violence Option

Author: Postmus, Judy L11 School Social Welfare, U Kansas, Lawrence postmus@ku.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60499754?accountid=14925

Abstract: Noting the incidence of battered women on welfare, lawmakers passed the Family Violence Option (FVO), which allows states to offer waivers from welfare program requirements. Assumptions were made that many women would seek relief under the FVO. However, reports indicate that less than 5% of welfare recipients are receiving waivers. This paper presents the findings from a qualitative study that sought to explore the experiences of 29 battered women with the welfare system & the FVO in NY. Their experiences suggest that changes in FVO screening process are necessary to fully implement the program in the way legislators intended. 20 References. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence: Predictors of Victim Support for Official Action

Author: Kingsnorth, Rodney F1; Macintosh, Randall C1 California State U, Sacramento kingsnorth@csus.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60529698?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this paper, using a sample of 5,272 domestic violence cases processed through the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office between 1 July 1999 & 31 Dec 2000, we analyze the predictors of victim support for official action. We test the impact of victim & offender characteristics, situational variables, & official behavior on whether it was the victim or some third party who called for assistance, whether the victim desired the arrest, & whether the victim was willing to prosecute. The multiple significant effects found include race/ethnicity, gender, cohabitation, co-parenthood, attack severity, victim injury, prior incidents, reporting of prior incidents, presence of a protective order, provision of victim services, victim substance use, & suspect injury. Especially important from a policy perspective is that prosecutor charging practice (ie, filing as a felony rather than a misdemeanor or violation of probation) was negatively associated with levels of victim support for prosecution. 2 Tables, 1 Figure, 62 References.

Characteristics of Female Perpetrators of Domestic Violence in Group Therapy

Author: Schroffel, Alan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61305913?accountid=14925

Abstract: This report is based on a set of clinical observations that identified unique characteristics of 12 female perpetrators of domestic violence in court ordered 52-week group treatment. The observations are primarily based on the experiences of two therapists who treated a group of 12 female participants, concurrent with two male groups, each of which consisted of 10 participants. A number of comparative clinical observations are made in relation to the treatment of these male & female perpetrators. The group leaders identified three characteristics specific to female perpetrators of domestic violence: compulsive & premature disclosure by more than half the participants in the woman's group, vs minimal or deferred disclosure in the men's groups; perception of self as perpetrator & ambivalent perception of self as victim in the women's group, vs perception of self as either victim or perpetrator in the men's groups; & devaluation of self in the women's group, vs devaluation of the partner in the men's groups. The group leaders also observed that the perceptions & attitudes of the younger, poorer, less well-educated participants often conflicted with those of their more affluent counterparts. Therapists who treat mandated perpetrators of domestic violence in groups must contend with direct expressions of hostility. They must also help clients recognize & understand reasons for their dysfunctional partnerships & begin to think about how they can develop healthier relationships. The clinical observations from this group strongly suggest that psychological & socioeconomic factors interact to significantly influence treatment process & outcomes. 22 References.

Making Sociological Sense out of Trends in Intimate Partner Violence: The Social Structure of Violence against Women

Author: Michalski, Joseph H11 King's University Coll, U Western Ontario

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60495646?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite evidence of a cultural shift in orientations toward violence, the problem of violence against women persists across a range of different societies. The preoccupation with the psychology of violence & the focus on cultural orientations obscure the more salient features of social life that promote violence: the structure of interpersonal relationships. The exploration of sociodemographic correlates & the search for "risk factors" of intimate partner violence have overshadowed the inclusion of a distinct set of social structural characteristics that are conducive to domestic violence. The current article draws on comparative research & Donald Black's theoretical approach to argue that key factors include (a) the degree of social isolation, (b) interdependence of support networks, (c) inequality, (d) relational distance, (e) centralization of authority, & (f) exposure to violent networks. The weak explanatory power of previous research can be improved by developing measures to evaluate an integrated structural model of violence against women. 88 References.

Acculturation, Gender Stereotypes, and Attitudes about Dating Violence among Latino Youth

Author: Ulloa, Emilio C1; Jaycox, Lisa H; Marshall, Grant N; Collins, Rebecca L1 San Diego State U, CA eulloa@sciences.sdsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60529336?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the relationship between personal characteristics (gender, acculturation, belief in gender stereotypes, recent dating experiences), & attitudes & knowledge about dating violence in urban Latino youth (N 678). All participants completed self-administered surveys at school. Relative to girls, boys held more problematic (proviolence) attitudes about dating violence & reported less knowledge about dating violence & its consequences. Teens who were more traditional (less acculturated), those who endorsed gender stereotypes, & those who reported recent fearful dating experiences tended to report less knowledge about abuse & lower endorsement of nonviolent attitudes. Multivariate analyses revealed that all four personal variables predicted dating violence knowledge. By contrast, attitudes were predicted by endorsement of gender stereotypes only, or gender stereotypes & gender. Implications for dating violence interventions & future directions for research are explored. 3 Tables, 50 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Use of Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs) As a Strategy to Address Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Kanuha, Valli Kalei1; Ross, Martha L1 School Social Work, U Hawaii, Honolulu kanuha@hawaii.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61543138?accountid=14925

Abstract: One of the most prominent interventions developed to protect victims in domestic abuse cases is the temporary restraining order or "TRO," the purpose of which is to restrain an alleged defendant from further harassment or abuse against a plaintiff. This report analyzes 397 restraining order petitions, & subsequent arrest & conviction data for TRO defendants from 1996 to 1998. Findings confirm that TRO petitioners report many types of abuse & while half of TRO defendants do not re-offend, a small percent of defendants are responsible for multiple police reports, arrests, & criminal violations. Outcome data are discussed for program & policy implications. 7 Tables, 30 References. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence Victims as Homicide Offenders: A Study of Gender Ideology in the Japanese Criminal Justice System

Author: Takamatsu, Kana11 Graduate School of Frontier Science, University of Tokyo, Japan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810426111?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study attempts to identify the biases and assumptions reflected in intra-household gender roles, to relate these roles to homicide cases in Japan where the wife kills the husband, and finally, to examine how women criminal offenders are ideologically treated. From case studies, it is clear that women criminal offenders are considered through biases and assumptions within the criminal justice system. If the character of the offender mirrors this prevalent image, she tends to not be punished strictly by the criminal justice system. However, if the character of the offender goes against the image of women, she tends to be punished strictly. Their personality as women is taken into account to a greater extent than the actual crime. In addition, the backgrounds and reasons for female homicide cases-in this case domestic violence-were not considered serious crimes, particularly until the Law on the Prevention of Spouse Violence and Protection of Victims was passed. Achieving gender equality in a society is crucial to not only reduce the number of victims of domestic violence, but to also give a fair judgment (not necessarily a light punishment) to women criminal offenders.

Is Domestic Violence a Gender Issue? Views from a British City

Author: Nicolson, Paula1; Wilson, Richard1 School Health & Related Research, U Sheffield, UK p.nicolson@sheffield.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60527646?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence involves the abuse, whether emotional, physical, sexual &/or economic, of one or more family (or ex-family) members by another family member within the home or wider domestic context. It is typically associated with increasing entrapment, injury, medical complaints, psycho-social problems & (sometimes) unsuccessful help-seeking. Research evidence demonstrates that domestic abuse is prolific, prolonged, impacts physically, emotionally & economically upon women & children in particular, over the long-term including well after they are safe from the perpetrator. Furthermore, such abuse is widespread & happens all over the world. The findings reported here are from an observational population survey conducted in one British city to assess awareness of domestic violence. While there appears to be a broadly held & well-informed definition of what actions constitute domestic violence & why it occurs, there are striking differences in perspective concerning public awareness of the frequency of domestic violence & knowledge of its importance as a safety issue indicating that it is still not seen generally as a serious social problem. 5 Tables, 70 References.

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) constitutes a major public health problem in the United States. This cross-sectional survey of 108 emergency department (ED) care providers & 146 ED visitors at three metropolitan EDs compared the beliefs of ED health care providers with those of community members about the relative benefits of the helpfulness of resources for IPV victims using hypothetical case scenarios. Although providers generally indicated that help resources were helpful in all scenarios, visitors were more discriminating, showing less support for resources in the lower-risk scenario. Regarding differences between groups, visitors selected police & attorneys more frequently than providers as a helpful resource, whereas providers selected shelters & counselors more frequently than visitors. Adjustment for previous experience with IPV did not change these results. Understanding the differences between health care providers' & community members' perceptions of resources for victims of IPV may improve the effectiveness of referral to IPV resources. 4 Tables, 12 References.

Effectiveness of Hotline, Advocacy, Counseling, and Shelter Services for Victims of Domestic Violence: A Statewide Evaluation

Author: Bennett, Larry1; Riger, Stephanie; Schewe, Paul; Howard, April; Wasco, Sharon1 Jane Addams Coll Social Work, U Illinois, Chicago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61433213?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors report the results of an evaluation of services provided by 54 Illinois domestic violence agencies. In collaboration with the University of Illinois at Chicago evaluation team, domestic violence advocates identified services to be evaluated, specified desired outcomes of those services, & participated in developing measures of those outcomes in both English & Spanish. With in the limitations of the study, outcomes were positive in all four program areas: hotline, counseling, advocacy, & shelter. The authors then discuss implications for evaluation of domestic violence programs that maintain victim safety as a guiding principle. 4 Tables, 26 References.

The First Israeli National Survey on Domestic Violence

Author: Eisikovits, Zvi1; Winstok, Zeev; Fishman, Gideon1 Faculty Social Welfare & Health Studies, U Haifa, Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60494870?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of the survey reported in this article was to assess the frequency & severity of violence against women in Israel & to identify some major risk factors associated with that violence. During 2000 & 2001, a structured self-report questionnaire was administered to a stratified probability sample drawn from the general population in Israel including 2,544 households, of which 2,092 included only women respondents & 452 included both men & women (904 respondents in total). When compared to those of other Western countries, the rates of psychological aggression in Israel are slightly higher, although the rates of physical aggression are lower. 5 Tables, 26 References.

The Extent of Family Violence in Europe. A Comparison of National Surveys

Author: Kury, Helmut1; Obergfell-Fuchs, Joachim; Woessner, Gunda1 Max-Planck-Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811125970?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reviews current victim studies on family violence in Europe and attempts to interpret the variation in the prevalence rates. Methodological shortcomings contribute in part to different rates across countries. The prevalence rates are also linked to preventive and causative factors. Three factors appear to explain the differing prevalence rates in European countries: deprived economic living conditions, traditional attitudes toward women and children, and a general tolerance of violent behavior in a given society. In addition, personal coping may influence whether a family member will act violently against another family member.

Definitional and Methodological Issues Related to Transnational Research on Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Saltzman, Linda E11 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811125307?accountid=14925

Abstract: To address intimate partner violence (IPV) transnationally, we must examine standardization of both terminology and measurement. This article comments on public health surveillance and efforts toward standardizing terminology on Violence Against Women and IPV. Starting with information about IPV from two U.S. surveys, it identifies issues including cueing and screening questions, survey context, repeat victimization, bounding, and question order to be considered in developing transnational research. Some steps for standardizing IPV measures include replicating initial findings in additional countries, agreeing on breadth of focus, determining strategies for choosing standard measures, and allowing for periodic updates to standardized definitions and measures.

Author: Jansen, Henrica A. F. M.1; Watts, Charlotte; Ellsberg, Mary; Heise, Lori; Garcia-Moreno, Claudia1 Dept Gender & Women's Health, World Health Organization

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61532021?accountid=14925

Abstract: The importance of a sound research strategy for measuring & understanding violence against women cross-culturally is well recognized. However, the value of specialized interviewer training to attain these data is not always fully appreciated. This article describes interviewer selection & training in the World Health Organization (WHO) Multi-Country Study on Women's Health & Domestic Violence & highlights their importance. Such training ensures high-quality data & cross-country comparability, protects the safety of respondents & interviewers, & increases the impact of the study. Moreover, women are not only willing to share experiences with trained & empathetic interviewers but also find the interview a positive experience. 2 Tables, 1 Figure, 11 References.

'Culture' as a Barrier to Service Provision and Delivery: Domestic Violence Services for Minoritized Women

Author: Burman, Erica1; Smailes, Sophie L; Chantler, Khatidja1 Women's Studies Research Centre/Discourse Unit, Dept Psychology & Speech Pathology, Manchester Metropolitan U, UK e.burman@mmu.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61498473?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper addresses how domestic violence services to women of African, African-Caribbean, South Asian, Jewish & Irish backgrounds are structured by assumptions about 'culture' which produce barriers to the delivery of domestic violence services. Phoenix's (1987, 'Theories of Gender & Black Families', pp. 50-61 in G. Weiner & M. Arnot (eds) Gender Under Scrutiny. London: Hutchinson) discussion of the representation of black women is applied more generally to analyse how discourses of gender & racialization function within accounts of domestic violence service provision. Discourses of both cultural specificity & generality/commonality are shown to intersect to effectively exclude minority ethnic women from such services. Domestic violence emerges as something that can be overlooked or even excused for 'cultural reasons', as a homogenized absence; or alternatively as a pathologized presence, producing heightened visibility of minoritized women both within & outside their communities -- since domestic violence brings them & their communities under particular scrutiny. Such configurations also inform discourses of service provision to minoritized women. Finally key implications are identified for service design, delivery & development, including the need for both culturally specific & mainstream provision around domestic violence, & the need to challenge notions of 'cultural privacy' & 'race anxiety' in work with minoritized communities. 24 References.

Changes in Intimate Partner Violence during Pregnancy

Author: Martin, Sandra L1; Harris-Britt, April; Li, Yun; Moracco, Kathryn E; Kupper, Lawrence L; Campbell, Jacquelyn C1 Dept Maternal & Child Health, U North Carolina, Chapel Hill sandra_martin@unc.edu

Abstract: Women's experiences of partner violence, both before & during pregnancy, are described using a convenience sample of women recruited from prenatal clinics. Included were an "index group" of women who told their clinicians that they had been physically abused during pregnancy, & a "comparison group" of women who told their clinicians that they had not been physically abused during pregnancy (even though later more detailed assessment found that some of these comparison women had experienced such violence). The women averaged 27 years of age, with 83% being high school graduates, 26% being married, & 66% having had previous children. The Conflict Tactics Scales 2 assessed rates of partner violence victimization of the women & their male partners, including psychological aggression, physical assault, & sexual coercion. Injuries also were assessed. Results showed that comparison men were physically assaulted at significantly higher rates than were their female partners, both before & during pregnancy (even though these victimization rates were much lower than those seen among the index couples). Index women experienced higher rates of psychological aggression, physical assault, & sexual coercion than did their male partners, & these women were significantly more likely than their male partners to be injured. Pregnancy onset was associated with significant increases in the rates of psychological aggression among both the index & comparison couples. In addition, the index women experienced a significantly increased rate of sexual violence victimization during pregnancy.

Pregnancy as a Stimulus for Domestic Violence

Author: Burch, Rebecca L1; Gallup, Gordon G, Jr1 c/o Gallup -- Dept Psychology, State U New York, Albany

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60538747?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data collected from a domestic violence prevention & treatment program were analyzed to determine the relationship between female reproductive status & violent incidents. Both the frequency & severity of male initiated violence against women were twice as high when they were pregnant. These results are discussed in the context of an evolutionary perspective on domestic violence. 42 References. Adapted from the source document.

Alcohol and Violence Related Cognitive Risk Factors Associated with the Perpetration of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Field, Craig A1; Caetano, Raul; Nelson, Scott1 School Public Health, U Texas, Houston

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60552248?accountid=14925

Abstract: The primary aim of this study is to determine the association between alcohol, violence-related cognitive risk factors, & impulsivity with the perpetration of partner violence among current drinkers. A probability sample (n = 1468) of White, Black, & Hispanic couples 18 years of age or older in the US household population was interviewed in 1995 with a response rate of 85%. The risk factors of interest included the alcohol & violence related cognitions of approval of marital aggression, alcohol as an excuse for misbehavior, & aggressive expectations following alcohol consumption as well as impulsivity. In all, 15% (216/1468) of the respondents reported perpetration of domestic violence. In addition, 24% (7/29) of those who approved of marital violence, 11% (126/1163) of those who reported alcohol use as an excuse for misbehavior, 10% (128/1257) of those who reported aggressive expectations following alcohol consumption, & 14% (99/716) of those who reported impulsivity also reported perpetration of domestic violence. Bivariate analysis indicated that all of the cognitive risk factors were significantly more common in those who reported perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) (p < 0.05). However, multivariate analysis controlling for ethnicity, education, income, age, gender, & impulsivity indicated that those who reported strong or very strong expectations of aggressive behavior following alcohol consumption were 3.2 (95% CI = 1.3-7.9) times more likely to perpetrate IPV. Although all of the alcohol & violence related cognitive risk factors were associated with the perpetration of domestic violence, expectations of aggressive behavior following alcohol consumption appeared to be the strongest predictor of the perpetration of IPV among current drinkers. Therefore, alcohol expectancy may be an important factor to assess when attempting to identify & treat perpetrators of domestic violence who are also current drinkers. 3 Tables, 23 References.

Partner Abuse, Learned Helplessness, and Trauma Symptoms

Author: Palker-Corell, Ann1; Marcus, David K1 c/o Marcus -- Dept Psychology, Sam Houston State U, Huntsville, TX

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60580449?accountid=14925

Abstract: We examined (a) whether attributional style is related to trauma & depressive symptoms among battered women, & (b) whether women from a battered women's shelter report a more helpless (or hopeless) attributional style than do women from the community. Women from a woman's shelter (n = 49) & a comparison group of women from the community (n = 51) completed measures of attributional style, relationship conflict, & psychological distress. As expected, women from the shelter reported considerably higher levels of conflict & distress. Furthermore, attributional style contributed to the prediction of both depressive & trauma symptoms. However, there was no evidence that battered women's attributional style differed from that of other women. Overall, the results provided some support for the revised learned helplessness model, but they did not support Walker's (2000) contention that partner abuse results in learned helplessness. 3 Tables, 37 References.

Representations and Counter-Representations of Domestic Violence on Clydeside between the Two World Wars

Author: Hughes, Annmarie11 Dept Economic & Social History, U Glasgow A.Hughes@arts.gla.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60523865?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article looks at representations in relation to the actual incidence of domestic violence between the wars on Clydeside. It argues that representations of domestic violence used by the law-enforcement & social work agencies were, & still largely are, class & gender based & do not fully depict the experience of violence. Violence was assumed to be aggression by men against women, was signified as working class & was associated with aspects of working-class male popular culture, especially gambling, alcohol consumption, & football mania. Absolving middle-class men from complicity in such behavior, these representations also collectivized men's violence & distracted attention from individual abusers: domestic violence was not seen as assault rather as an unfortunate cultural problem. This gave abusers a self-justification. However, male popular culture did not cause men to beat their wives, nor were women the only sex to be beaten. In fact, the dominant representations of domestic violence were inadequate not only because they laid the blame on male popular culture but because they excluded consideration of middle-class men & women, women whose partners did not take part in male popular culture & the fact that victims were male as well as female. 1 Table.

The Correlation between Race and Domestic Violence Is Confounded with Community Context

Author: Benson, Michael L1; Wooldredge, John; Thistlethwaite, Amy B; Fox, Greer Litton1 Division Criminal Justice, U Cincinnati, OH michael.benson@uc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60095448?accountid=14925

Abstract: Why do African Americans appear to have a higher likelihood of engaging in domestic violence than whites? To address this question, we draw on insights from social disorganization theory & recent research on urban poverty. We argue that the apparent correlation between race & domestic violence is confounded with the different ecological contexts typically occupied by African Americans & whites. Using data from wave 2 of the National Survey of Families & Households & the 1990 US census, we show the following conclusions: (1) rates of domestic violence for both African Americans & whites vary systematically by type of community; (2) the correlation between race & domestic violence is substantially reduced or disappears altogether when whites are compared to African Americans in similar ecological contexts; & (3) individual-level risk factors for domestic violence appear to operate similarly for both African Americans & whites. 5 Tables, 64 References.

Canadian Domestic Violence Policy and Indian Immigrant Women

Author: Shirwadkar, Swati11 Dept Sociology, U Pune, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60580133?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores the problems of Indian immigrant women who face cultural constraints in accessing the benefits of Canadian policies for domestically abused women. Findings from an exploratory study of abused immigrant Indian women & community social workers in Ontario, Canada, are presented. They expose the pressures of cultural, social, & family ties that prevent these women from getting necessary help for domestic violence. The limitations of Canadian policies & programs for these women & the means to improve their access to these policies & programs are discussed. The conclusion suggests how binational research is needed to improve the situation of abused Indian immigrant women in Canada & in India. 61 References.

Toward a Transnational and Cross-Cultural Analysis of Family Violence

Author: Cousineau, Marie-Marthe1; Rondeau, Gilles1 School Criminology, U Montreal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60535090?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article summarizes issues & priorities for prevalence surveys & intervention studies raised by researchers & practitioners at an international symposium on transnational & cross-cultural research on family violence, convened near Montreal, Canada, in June 2003. The major conceptual questions were What is meant by transnational or cross-cultural research? & What should be included in the definition of family violence? The major methodological questions were What level of standardization of measurement is needed to reliably make comparisons across nations & cultures? & Should the measures be of "acts" of abuse & violence or the "effects" of those acts? 12 References.

The Social Networks of Women Experiencing Domestic Violence

Author: Levendosky, Alytia A1; Bogat, G Anne; Theran, Sally A; Trotter, Jennifer S; Von Eye, Alexander; Davidson, William S, II1 Michigan State U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61555280?accountid=14925

Abstract: The research literature has demonstrated that battered women living in shelters experience impaired social support. This study examines this phenomenon among battered women living in the community. This study compared a group of pregnant battered women (n=145) & a group of pregnant nonbattered women (n=58) in terms of their structural [eg, total number of supporters, network members in violent relationships with their partners (an index of homophily or nonhomophily]) & functional [eg, emotional)] social support. Four reasons for impaired support in battered women were proposed & examined, including social isolation, failure to disclose abuse, homophily, & low SES. Only homophily was related to impaired support among battered women. In addition, the relationship between structural & functional support & mental health outcomes (eg, depression, self-esteem) was examined. Criticism, practical support, homophily, & disclosure were all significant predictors of mental health for battered women. Implications for community-based interventions are discussed in the context of current intervention strategies with battered women. 4 Tables, 2 Figures, 66 References.

Filipino Men's Familial Roles and Domestic Violence: Implications and Strategies for Community-Based Intervention

Author: Lee, Romeo B11 Behavioral Sciences Dept, De La Salle U, Manila, Philippines leer@dlsu.edu.ph

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61559838?accountid=14925

Abstract: Men's gender roles have contributed to family violence, but the ramifications of these roles in the development of community-based programs for men have not been given much attention. A small-scale qualitative examination of the familial context of Filipino men's positions & roles, & their domestic violence experiences & attitudes was carried out using eight discussion groups, each group with seven to eight members. Verbatim tape-recorded transcripts were analyzed using accepted techniques for theoretical analysis to establish emergent themes. Discussants saw themselves as being at the helm of their families. Men were knowledgeable of & took responsibility for their gender roles exerting control over the focus & direction of all their family affairs, including the gender roles of their wives/partners. This control demonstrated facets of their hegemonic masculinity such as sexual objectification & dominance. Men in this society come from a traditional position of power, dominance, & privilege. They will be particularly sensitive to interventions aimed at reducing violence against women that will enquire into their private lives. In their view, such interventions were both a direct challenge to their family leadership & a basis for 'losing face'. Strategies for positive interventions include the need for male-sensitive & male-centered approaches that avoid demonizing or stereotyping men. 1 Box, 32 References.

When Terror Strikes at Home: The Interface between Religion and Domestic Violence

Author: Nason-Clark, Nancy11 Dept Sociology, U New Brunswick, Fredericton nasoncla@unb.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60522893?accountid=14925

Abstract: Several aspects of the relationship between religion & domestic violence are examined. The extent of domestic violence experienced by women in "religious families" & the difficulties of providing assistance to such women are discussed. It is asserted that the Judeo-Christian notions of forgiveness & reconciliation may actually contribute to women's experience of domestic violence because such concepts increase the vulnerability of abused women. The extent to which faith-based batterer intervention programs can reduce domestic violence is acknowledged; however, it is stressed that such approaches must utilize both religious & secular resources to effectively curb abusive behavior. Several recommendations for future research are offered, eg, identifying aspects of religious traditions that discourage efforts to raise a community's awareness of domestic violence & determining how issues of race & class intersect with domestic violence in religious families. 35 References.

A Positive Domestic Violence Screen Predicts Future Domestic Violence

Author: Houry, Debra1; Feldhaus, Kim; Peery, Benjamin; Abbott, Jean; Lowenstien, Steven R; al-Bataa-de-Montero, Sameerah; Levine, Saul1 Center Injury Control, Emory U

Abstract: The objective of this study was to determine if a brief screen for domestic violence (DV) predicts future violence. We conducted a cohort study of adult women who presented to an inner-city emergency department during an 8-week study period. Participants were screened for DV using the Partner Violence Screen (PVS). At 4 months, follow-up telephone interviews were conducted: rates of verbal & physical violence were measured using the modified Conflict Tactics Scale. Relative risks of violent events (physical & verbal) were calculated. Of the 215 women who enrolled, 36 (16%) had an initial screen positive for DV. Ninety-six women participated in the follow-up phase; of these women, 9% had screened positive for DV. At 4 months, women with DV were 11.3 times more likely to experience physical violence & 7.3 times more likely to experience verbal aggression. The study's screen identified women at high risk for subsequent physical violence & verbal aggression. 4 Tables, 1 Figure, 15 References.

Is Domestic Violence Relevant? An Exploratory Analysis of Couples Referred for Mediation in Family Court

Author: Tishler, Carl L1; Bartholomae, Suzanne; Katz, Bonnie L; Landry-Meyer, Laura1 Ohio State U, Columbus tishler.1@osu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61496513?accountid=14925

Abstract: Mediation is an essential component of custody evaluation & reconciliation services in domestic courts. Data from 306 couples with & without a reported history of domestic violence (DV) who were ordered to attend an assessment for mediation were analyzed to determine differences in the mediation process. More than one third reported a history of DV. Chi-square analysis showed that differences in the mediation process exist between couples reporting DV & couples reporting no DV. A greater proportion of couples with reported DV (a) actually attended the court-mandated assessment session, (b) were deemed unsuitable to participate in the mediation process, (c) were in default of child-support payments, & (d) reported drug & alcohol abuse. No significant differences were found between the two groups in the measured mediation outcomes. Implications for the use of mediation with couples who reported DV & recommendations for future research are discussed. 2 Tables, 48 References.

Deaths in the Family: Domestic Violence, Witchcraft Accusations and Political Militancy in Transkei, South Africa, 1904-1965

Author: Redding, Sean11 Dept History, Amherst Coll, MA sredding@amherst.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60573979?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article discusses the intimate causes of violence within the family in the Transkei by analyzing specific court cases that illustrate the significance of common beliefs in supernatural powers in framing domestic disputes. The belief in women's potential for violence, both directly through physical means, but also indirectly through the use of supernatural powers, was the foundation for many familial disputes. People used witchcraft allegations & violence to isolate & eradicate causes of social disruption & to punish instigators. Although the argument mostly concerns the intimacy of familial or domestic violence, it indicates also how witchcraft accusations in the late 1950s & early 1960s crossed over into the realm of politics in an analogous attempt to isolate & remedy the supernatural causes of the broader social & economic problems created by state policies. People turned to both witchcraft accusations & violence against state officials in the political unrest that emerged during those years. Adapted from the source document.

Welfare Reform, Domestic Violence, and Employment. What Do We Know and What Do We Need to Know?

Author: Riger, Stephanie1; Staggs, Susan L1 University of Illinois at Chicago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810994715?accountid=14925

Abstract: Welfare reforms enacted in 1996 require that recipients work to receive benefits. Advocates for battered women feared that abusive men would escalate violence in response to independence brought to women by employment. Yet research on employment, domestic violence, and welfare reform has yielded mixed findings. The authors review those findings and propose that a context-sensitive social-psychological perspective identifying relevant dimensions of culture and measuring partner's employment may be more useful than a focus only on characteristics of women. Findings suggest that inclusion of generous work supportsin welfare legislation may help reducepoverty and domestic violence.

"Family Violence": The Language of Legitimacy

Author: Hammons, Stacy A11 Dept Sociology & Anthropology, Fresno Pacific U, CA shammons@fresno.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60499948?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examinations of social movements have typically overlooked the organizational context of social-movement agencies as well as the role of agency employees in shaping the larger movement. This study explored meso-& micro-level forces that affect the battered women's movement, as found in one particular women's shelter. The findings suggest that although the larger social movement may encourage the examination of battering from a systemic perspective, shelter workers adopt a more narrow, psychological interpretation. Shelter workers adopt this perspective because of the socialization that occurs within the shelter context itself, which employees then replicate to be seen as competent. 36 References.

Domestic Violence in the Orthodox Jewish Home: A Value-Sensitive Approach to Recovery

Author: Grodner, Elana; Sweifach, Jay

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61490485?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence, a once-hidden problem in the Orthodox Jewish community, is now acknowledged to occur in Orthodox Jewish families. Because this problem was not affirmed earlier, effective therapeutic techniques for working with battered Orthodox women have only recently begun to emerge. This article highlights one therapeutic technique -- the value-sensitive approach -- which uses ethnocultural-religious factors as part of the therapeutic process & has generated positive results in working with battered Orthodox women. 14 References.

Abstract: Dual arrests in family violence cases have increased following passage of proarrest laws. This study examined the relationship between officers' perceptions of their departmental policies & arrest outcomes. Each officer was given 1 of 6 hypothetical scripts that varied as to whether the wife only was injured or the wife & husband were injured. They were then asked what action they would take. Results indicate that officers who believed that their department would support arrest of both parties are more likely to arrest both parties. Officers who perceived that their department encouraged arrest of the primary aggressor only are more likely to arrest the husband only. When both parties were injured, officers were likely to arrest both. Experienced officers were more likely than novice officers to use dual arrest. Implications for the importance of primary aggressor language are discussed. 4 Tables, 59 References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2004.]

Abstract: In this article, the authors discuss & evaluate a solution-focused treatment program for domestic violence offenders. Building on a strengths perspective, a solution-focused approach holds a person accountable for solutions instead of focusing on problems. The outcome study was a 1-group pre & posttest design with a 6-month follow-up to evaluate the effectiveness of a solution-focused group treatment program for 90 domestic violence offenders who were ordered by the court to receive treatment. Findings of the outcome study indicated a recidivism rate of 16.7% of program participants as based on official records over a 6-year period. There was a significant improvement in participants' relational skills in intimate relationships as evaluated by their spouses or partners & a significant increase in their self-esteem based on self-reports. Implications for treatment & research with domestic violence offenders are discussed. 6 Tables, 1 Figure, 64 References. Adapted from the source document.

Components of an Aboriginal-Based Family Violence Intervention Program

Author: Brown, Jason1; Languedoc, Sue1 Dept Family Social Sciences, U Manitoba, Winnipeg jason_brown@umanitoba.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61522084?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of the study was to describe the essential elements of an Aboriginal-based family violence intervention program. Twenty-one Aboriginal family violence program administrators & service providers were asked "What program components are essential in an Aboriginal family violence prevention program?" Respondents identified the need for sound administrative structure & function, qualified & healthy staff, & consistent program funding. Coordinated service delivery with other community agencies was described. Program components should be based on traditional teachings, should create awareness of personal & family dynamics & change, & should educate about family violence. There were needs for components for partners seperately, partners & their children, partners together, & the whole family. These components coincided with Aboriginal traditional teachings. Implications for program development were described. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 25 References. Adapted from the source document.

A Postcolonial Women's Law? Domestic Violence and the Ontario Liquor Board's "Indian List," 1950-1990

Author: Valverde, Mariana

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59978708?accountid=14925

Abstract: The 1920's Prohibition era discourse linked drinking with domestic violence. As a supposed legacy of Prohibition, the Ontario Liquor Board kept a list from the 1930s-1990s of troublesome alcoholics, mainly referred to the list by abused women, that put a police watch on the men listed & prohibited their liquor purchases at bars & stores. This list was dubbed the "Indian list", demonstrating the original, postcolonial intent to separate First Americans from whites, & the continuation of prior race-specific liquor prohibitions. White & Indian cases on the interdiction list are described; 17 out of 154 concern women & some involve seniors in old age homes. This emphasis on alcohol in this legal tool shows how early feminism attempted to govern domestic abuse with the removal of alcohol, not by criminalizing domestic violence. M. Pflum

Coping among Adult Female Victims of Domestic Violence

Author: Waldrop, Angela E1; Resick, Patricia A1 Dept Psychiatry, Medical U South Carolina, Charleston waldrop@musc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60544695?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examines the current literature regarding coping among battered women. It considers a number of contextual factors that are related to women's choices in coping with partner abuse, including factors related to the relationship (eg, frequency & severity of abuse, length of relationship) & women's resources (eg, social support, financial resources). Relationships between different forms of coping & psychological outcomes are also examined. As the research in domestic violence coping is somewhat lacking in coherence, theories & models from the broader coping literature are used to organize the findings from the domestic violence field. Methodological concerns, such as research methods, measurement issues, & sampling, are raised throughout the paper. Suggestions for future research are made. 48 References.

Monsters and victims: Male felons' accounts of intimate partner violence

Author: Wood, Julia T11 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811184007?accountid=14925

Abstract: Previous research on men who commit intimate partner violence has addressed two questions: (1) how can researchers and clinicians classify men's accounts of intimate partner violence?, and (2) do men who engage in intimate partner violence subscribe to particular codes of manhood? The present study linked these two questions by asking how men account for their own intimate partner violence and how their accounts draw upon understandings of manhood. Grounded theory analysis of interviews with 22 incarcerated men identified three categories of themes in participants' accounts of intimate partner violence: justifications ('she disrespected me as a man; ''a man has a right to control his woman; ''she provoked me; ''she took it'); dissociations ('I am not the abusive type; ''my violence was limited, and abusers don't limit their abuse'); and remorse ('I regret I abused her'). Divergence among these representations of violent men's reasons for violence and previous typologies reflects this study's focus on insiders' views of behavior. Also, the themes that emerged from participants were informed by conflicting, although not wholly independent, codes of manhood that circulate in U. S. cultural life. Attention to violent men's sense-making strategies and contradictory narratives of manhood suggests opportunities for intervention and rehabilitation.

Human Trafficking and Domestic Violence: Comparisons in Research Methodology Needs and Strategies

Author: Busch, Noel Bridget1; Fong, Rowena; Williamson, Jane1 School Social Work, U Texas, Austin nbusch@mail.utexas.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61519080?accountid=14925

Abstract: Human trafficking is a major social problem that requires well-informed, empirically grounded policy & practice responses. The risks of human trafficking for women & the consequential psychological, emotional, & physical effects demonstrate the need for social work involvement, especially in the researched areas on violence & cultural competency. This article presents the similarities in the dynamics of intimate partner abuse & human trafficking & suggests that domestic organizations serving victims of domestic violence & sexual assault are the appropriate community agencies to provide services to & research on human trafficking victims. This article also discusses culturally competent practices & the development of a broad community response to address the issues related to human trafficking including training needs & research methodology needs & strategies. 44 References.

Domestic Violence against Women, and Their Economic Dependence: A Count Data Analysis

Author: Basu, Bharati1; Famoye, Felix1 Dept Economics, Central Michigan U, Mount Pleasant

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60571117?accountid=14925

Abstract: In examining the relationship between violence against women & women's economic dependence, existing literature treats the incidents of violence either as a binary or as a continuous variable. However, the incidents of violence is a count variable &, quite often, data on the number of violent incidents is categorized. This paper estimates the relation between violence against women & economic dependence by using a categorized negative binomial regression model. The model is suitable for categorized count data & thus provides a more accurate estimation of the relation than what is provided in the literature. Data analysis in this paper shows that less economic dependence of women is associated with less violence. 4 Tables, 31 References. Adapted from the source document.

Child Maltreatment in Families Experiencing Domestic Violence

Author: Lee, Li-Ching1; Kotch, Jonathan B; Cox, Christine E1 Dept Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health, Baltimore, MD llee2@jhsph.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60513546?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the association between physical domestic violence (PDV) & reported child maltreatment in a cohort of children at risk for maltreatment. Participants were 219 6- to 7-year-old children & their caregivers. PDV was measured by combining caregivers' self-reports & children's reports, while child maltreatment was based on state Division of Social Services Central Registry records. Among 219 child-caregiver pairs studied, 42 (19.2%) had at least one maltreatment report in the 2 years following the interviews. PDV consistently predicted child maltreatment, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 2.96 to 3.46. In addition, we investigated interactions between PDV & other predictors of child maltreatment. Among Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) participants, PDV was highly associated with child maltreatment. However, this pattern was not observed among subjects who did not have AFDC. There is an increased incidence of child maltreatment reports in families experiencing PDV. AFDC participation intensified the probability of child maltreatment in the presence of PDV. Findings also suggest that in households experiencing PDV, social supports may protect children from maltreatment. 3 Tables, 2 Figures, 91 References. Adapted from the source document.

Impacts of Agency Coordination on Nonprofit Domestic Violence and Sexual Assualt Programs in Communities with STOP Formula Grant Funding

Author: Zweig, Janine M; Burt, Martha R

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61553851?accountid=14925

Abstract: The goals of the current study are (a) to understand the community & state context in which STOP(Services/Training/Officers/Prosecutors)-funded victim service (VS) programs operate, (b) to assess the degree to which receipt of STOP funding for VS programs & the degree of state-level STOP agency support for collaboration among community agencies have led to improved program services & community interaction, & (c) to assess the degree to which improved interaction between community agencies leads to improvements for VS programs. The results show that community interaction between VS programs & other community agencies can improve VS program services as reported by service providers. In addition, the higher the pre-STOP levels of activity around violence against women issues in communities, the more agencies can enhance their service system with STOP funding. Also, STOP funding has facilitated greater levels of change for communities whose pre-STOP attention to violence against women was lower. 2 Tables, 1 Figure, 10 References.

Rethinking Law and Violence: The Domestic Violence (Prevention) Bill in India, 2002

Author: Rajan, Rajeswari Sunder11 English Faculty, Wolfson Coll, U Oxford

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60522981?accountid=14925

Abstract: This essay focuses on the controversy generated by recent proposed legislation on domestic violence in India. An alternative draft bill on domestic violence prepared by the feminist legal nongovernmental organization (NGO), the Lawyers' Collective, & supported by women's groups nationally, includes a demand that victims of domestic violence (usually wives) be permitted by law to continue to occupy the domestic home, a demand that the Government bill has refused to include. This demand is theoretically informed by a politics of space. Bodies & space are linked, to the extent that each is an abstraction without the concept of the other to ground it. The feminist legal proposal challenges property-as-absolute-(male) ownership by conceptualizing the household as, instead, shared domestic space. The proposal does not dissimulate common sense -- it is conscious of being radical, in part at least because it demystifies the 'domestic' as an ideological construct & offers it instead realistically & minimally as simply an alternative to destitution. The recognition that there are no support structures for dependant women outside the family (such as, eg, state-sponsored welfare institutions), so that destitution can be both sudden & real for women of any class & circumstances, has led to the conceptualization of a law that formulates a right to shared space as one that makes no claim to shared ownership -- while at the same time questioning the other's absolute property right. Despite the limited nature of the claim it makes, this proposal has been viewed as threatening by Indian law-makers. 1 Appendix. Adapted from the source document.

Perceptions of Domestic Violence: A Dialogue with African American Women

Author: Bent-Goodley, Tricia B11 School Social Work, Howard U, Washington, DC tmgoodley@aol.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61315963?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although empirical research has accumulated over the past 20 years regarding African Americans & domestic violence, many questions remain about African American perceptions of domestic violence. This article explores African American women's perceptions about domestic violence through three focus groups held at a NY social services agency. The findings point to the need to better understand diverse perceptions of domestic violence, to find culturally competent methods of addressing the inaccessibility of domestic violence services, to increase culturally appropriate public education, & to conduct more research on the connection between domestic violence & child welfare in communities of color. 63 References. Adapted from the source document.

Dating Violence Attributions: Do They Differ for In-Group and Out-Group Members Who Have a History of Dating Violence?

Author: Harrison, Lisa A1; Abrishami, Golee1 Dept Psychology, California State U, Sacramento

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60546775?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this research we examined the influence of in-group bias & dating violence history on dating violence attributions. Participants were 113 college students (97 women & 16 men; age M=21.9). They read a vignette that depicted dating violence & then completed a questionnaire concerning the assault. The couple was described as either part of the participants' in-group or the participants' out-group. The dating violence was described as either a first-time event for the couple or a repeated act of violence. Participants formed more lenient attributions for the in-group assailant than for the out-group assailant, but only if he was a first-time assailant rather than a repeat assailant. In addition, participants attributed less blame to the in-group victim than to the out-group victim, but only if she was a repeat victim of dating violence. These findings are examined in relation to in-group bias. 3 Tables, 28 References. Adapted from the source document.

Critiquing the Case for Marriage Promotion: How the Promarriage Movement Misrepresents Domestic Violence Research

Author: Catlett, Beth Skilken1; Artis, Julie E1 Dept Sociology, DePaul U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61537972?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article argues that governmental policies to promote marriage fail to recognize the reality of domestic violence in many families' lives. By minimizing & misrepresenting the role of domestic violence, these policies ultimately are self-defeating. After describing the recent history of welfare reform & marriage promotion policies, we briefly review the arguments advanced in favor of such policies. We then offer a critique of marriage promotion through the prism of social science research on domestic violence & explain how advocates largely ignore or misrepresent this research. Finally, we discuss the need to ground policy formation in the voices of those women whose lives such policies ultimately will affect. 44 References.

When Advocacy for Domestic Violence Victims Backfires: Types and Sources of Victim Disempowerment

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61514198?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article argues that although victim advocacy in domestic violence has brought significant improvement in victim services, there are instances in which advocacy backfires: The very interventions designed to help & empower victims contain the seeds of disempowerment. After discussing types & sources of victim disempowerment from their own research & that of others, the authors draw attention to some macro issues related to domestic violence victim advocacy. 21 References.

Social Support and Spirituality as Culturally Relevant Factors in Coping among African American Women Survivors of Partner Abuse

Author: Fowler, Dawnovise N1; Hill, Hope M1 School Social Work, U Texas, Austin

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61433962?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined partner abuse, mental health, & coping in a sample of African American women survivors of partner abuse (N = 126). The mediating effects of social support & spirituality, as culturally relevant factors in coping, on the relationships between partner abuse & both depression & posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were investigated. Findings from hierarchical regression analysis indicated that PTSD symptoms remain significantly related to partner abuse after controlling for the effects of social support & spirituality. Findings point to practice & research implications regarding African American women survivors' mental health & ways of coping. 2 Tables, 57 References.

Gender Differences in Adolescent and Young Adult Predictors of Later Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Chen, Ping-Hsin1; White, Helene Raskin1 U Medicine & Dentistry, New Jersey Medical School

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60539540?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors examined distal predictors of perpetration & victimization of intimate partner violence (IPV) among 725 young adult men & women using prospective data. Earlier problem drinking & negative affect were common predictors of perpetration for both genders. Lower education predicted female perpetration; parental fighting predicted male perpetration. No common predictors of victimization were found for men & women. Lower education, problem drinking, & childhood parental beating predicted female victimization. None of the models explained a large amount of the variance in IPV. More longitudinal research is needed on gender differences in the explanations for & consequences of IPV. 3 Tables, 46 References.

Insults, Injury, and Injustice: Rethinking State Intervention in Domestic Violence Cases

Author: Stark, Evan11 Rutgers U, Newark

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60548079?accountid=14925

Abstract: Part of a review symposium on Linda G. Mills' (2003) framework for reforming the US criminal justice system's participation in the anti-domestic violence movement. An overview of Mills' critique of the national criminal justice system's involvement in domestic violence cases & suggestion that community-based support programs be used to rectify domestic violence between couples is presented. Various problems with Mills' methodology are highlighted including the exclusion of convincing research or case studies that detail problems with the existing approach from her work. Mills' assertion that she is not a conservative feminist is strongly questioned. Additional difficulties with Mills' alternative framework & empirical contentions are identified; for instance, her assertion that the mandatory arrest of male abusers actually augments African American women's experience of domestic violence is questioned. A possible explanation for the failure of mandatory arrest to reduce the domestic violence faced by African American women is then offered. A comparison of Mills' & S. Das Gupta's (2003) respective critiques of the US criminal justice system's involvement in domestic violence cases is also provided to illustrate how the federal government can remain a participant in the anti-domestic violence movement.

Race, Poverty, and the Crime-Centered Response to Domestic Violence: A Comment on Linda Mills's Insult to Injury: Rethinking Our Responses to Intimate Abuse

Author: Coker, Donna11 School Law, U Miami

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60504589?accountid=14925

Abstract: Part of a review symposium on Linda G. Mills' (2003) framework for reforming the US criminal justice system's participation in the anti-domestic violence movement. Existing literature that has examined the problems created by a criminal justice approach to reducing domestic violence in the US is reviewed, illustrating that mandatory punishment for perpetrators of domestic violence has not significantly reduced recidivism rates but has augmented state control over battered women. Mills' explanation for the criminal justice system's considerable involvement in domestic violence cases, assertion that battered women who stay in abusive relationships are socially pathologized, & claim that battered women's enactment of emotional or non-violent aggression is equivalent to abusers' physical violence are subsequently explored. A comparison of Mills' programmatic reform, which advocates the use of community-based support program called Intimate Abuse Circles, with an alternative framework that prioritizes restorative justice is conducted, illuminating the shortcomings of Mills' approach & recognizing the advantages of the restorative justice model. 101 References.

Rethinking Criminal Justice Responses to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Raphael, Jody11 Coll Law, DePaul U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61556505?accountid=14925

Abstract: Part of a review symposium on Linda G. Mills' (2003) framework for reforming the US criminal justice system's participation in the anti-domestic violence movement. Several aspects of Mills' work are critiqued or questioned including her contention that couples with histories of domestic violence are equally responsible for such violent behavior, her use of this position to challenge mandatory arrest policies, & her tendency to overlook how domestic violence contributes to women's inability to realize educational or occupational growth. Although Mills' community-based support program approach to reducing domestic violence, called Intimate Abuse Circles, is deemed beneficial for some women, it is asserted that this perspective would not be welcomed by all battered women. Mills' criticism of the criminal justice system's involvement in domestic violence cases is partially accepted; however, it is maintained that some cases will require the system's participation to ensure battered women's safety & that legal resources can be strong agents of cultural change. Alternative approaches for preventing domestic violence in the US are thus offered & recommendations for improving upon Mills' work are suggested. 23 References. J. W. Parker

Domestic Violence and the Politics of Trauma

Author: Humphreys, Cathy1; Joseph, Stephen1 School Health & Social Studies, U Warwick, Coventry, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61551735?accountid=14925

Abstract: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has had a chequered history in relation to gender-based violence & specifically domestic violence. There is evidence that a significant proportion of women who are abused suffer from PTSD. However, there remains a controversy about whether this is a useful & progressive concept on which to base intervention. Mainstream mental health services in the UK have shown little 'take up', while women's services supporting survivors also remain ambivalent, although for different reasons. Clinical psychology has been where the concept has been embraced. This paper highlights aspects of Judith Herman's (Herman, Judith (1992). Trauma and recovery. New York: Basic Books.) original intervention framework which have remained undeveloped, specifically the attention to social support & the need for an active social movement. These ideas have been marginalized in the development of professional & individualised approaches to survivors. It is suggested that reinvigorating these ideas would enhance the work with survivors & provide greater resonance with the underpinnings of work with women's services. 72 References.

Deconstructing the Relationship between Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual HIV Risk among Drug-Involved Men and Their Female Partners

Author: El-Bassel, Nabila1; Gilbert, Louisa; Golder, Seana; Wu, Elwin; Chang, Mingway; Fontdevila, Jorge; Sanders, Glorice1 Social Intervention Group, School Social Work, Columbia U, New York, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61495642?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study, based on data from a random sample of 322 men on methadone, examines whether traditional male gender role beliefs, male substance use, & couple drug-involvement lead to male psychological dominance, which in turn leads to perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) & sexual HIV risk behavior. Structural equation modeling indicated that male psychological dominance is directly associated with perpetrating both physical IPV & sexual HIV risk; however, physical IPV did not lead to sexual HIV risk as predicted originally. Stronger endorsement of traditional male gender role beliefs was associated with male psychological dominance. Couple drug-involvement was also directly associated with male psychological dominance as well as sexual HIV risk. Male substance use led to couple drug-involvement, but not to physical or sexual HIV risk as hypothesized. Study findings highlight the significance of couple drug-involvement & male psychological dominance as pathways leading to physical IPV & sexual HIV risk behavior. Implications for HIV prevention efforts targeting drug-involved men & their sexual partners are discussed. 3 Tables, 2 Figures, 60 References. Adapted from the source document.

Voicing the Silent Fear: South Asian Women's Experiences of Domestic Violence

Author: Gill, Aisha11 U Surrey Roehampton

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60527693?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the subjective experiences of South Asian women in the United Kingdom who have suffered domestic violence, & identifies some of the risk factors for domestic violence within this community. The study, based on in-depth interviews with 18 Asian women, describes & analyses several aspects of domestic violence in relation to South Asian women. The guiding research questions are: how do Asian women interpret their experiences of domestic violence, & to whom do they report it? This article presents data that suggest that abusive acts against Asian women arise out of a multiplicity of cultural circumstances influenced by power relations. Abusive acts are not therefore limited to a single characteristic, such as physical abuse, or to a particular relationship. Recurrent themes emerge from the women's accounts, revealing their definitions of domestic violence & showing how some continue to play down the levels of violence they experience. The article voices the concerns of & hardships experienced by victims & survivors of domestic violence, in their own words. Finally, the article offers an analysis of the ways in which notions of honor & shame are used both as tools to constrain women's self-determination & independence, & as catalysts for domestic violence when these notions of family & community are challenged by women. Adapted from the source document.

Correlates of the Co-Occurrence of Wife Abuse and Child Abuse among a Representative Sample

Author: Tajima, Emiko A11 School Social Work, U Washington, Seattle etajima@u.washington.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61433422?accountid=14925

Abstract: The co-occurrence of domestic violence & child abuse is well documented (Appel, A. E., & Holden, G. W. (1998). J. Fam. Psychol. 12: 578-599; Edleson, J. L. (1999). Violence Against Women 5: 134-154). However, little is known about the correlates of co-occurring wife & child abuse. Analyzing data from the 1985 National Family Violence Survey (subsample N = 2733), this study identified risk factors associated with the co-occurrence of wife & child abuse. One-way ANOVA & chi-square analyses were conducted to compare characteristics of parents, children, & households among subgroups of families reporting some form of abuse. Key differences emerged between the three types of homes compared (i.e., those with child abuse alone, wife abuse alone, or wife & child abuse), indicating possibly distinct etiologies & processes. In particular, the co-occurrence of wife & child abuse was marked by less education, worse health, increased reports of depression, & increased husband drug use. Findings may be useful to practitioners & researchers interested in risk factors for different forms of family violence. 4 Tables, 2 Figures, 35 References. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and the Justice System: An Examination of the Interface

Author: Jordan, Carol E11 Center Research Violence Against Women, U Kentucky

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61548783?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women entering the court system face a challenging experience, in part, because a courtroom can be an intimidating & difficult place for any person, & in part because women victimized by crimes in which the offender is known to them face distinctive difficulties when they seek the court's remedies. The interface is also made more challenging for women as the literature offers disparate findings as to the efficacy of criminal justice responses & civil remedies. This article briefly explores the unique characteristics of intimate partner violence cases that influence the interface of these victims with the court system. A review is provided of research on the criminal justice interventions in cases of intimate partner violence; & research on the efficacy of civil protective orders. 22 References.

Author: Campbell, Jacquelyn C11 School Nursing, Johns Hopkins U

Abstract: Only approximately one-half of the 456 women who were killed or almost killed by a husband, boyfriend, or ex-husband or ex-boyfriend in a recent national study of homicide of women accurately perceived their risk of being killed by their abusive partner. Women are unlikely to overestimate their risk; however, many will underestimate the severity of the situation. From the same study, it was found that relatively few of the victims of actual or attempted intimate partner femicide were seen by domestic violence advocates during the year before they were killed; they were far more likely to be seen in the health care system. Implications are drawn as to innovative ways that women who are abused can be identified & with skilled assessment of the danger in their relationship helped make more informed plans for their safety. 33 References.

Separation as a Risk Factor for Victims of Intimate Partner Violence: Beyond Lethality and Injury. A Response to Campbell

Author: Logan, T K1; Walker, Robert1 Dept Behavioral Science, U Kentucky

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61434060?accountid=14925

Abstract: Leaving an abusive partner can lead to death or serious injury, but separation involves other risk factors as well: mental & physical health problems; concerns over child safety & custody; & barriers to help-seeking, including poverty, psychological stress, & social isolation. These risk factors may affect a woman's ability to adjust to the separation or remain separated from her violent ex-partner. Violent ex-partners sometimes threaten to harm the children & may use child visitation to further victimize the abused ex-partner. The need for further research on risk factors associated with separation from a violent partner is discussed. 66 References. A. Lee

Black Women and Intimate Partner Violence: New Directions for Research

Author: West, Carolyn M11 Interdisciplinary Arts & Sciences Program, U Washington, Tacoma carwest@u.washington.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61454905?accountid=14925

Abstract: African American women are at elevated risk for nonfatal & lethal intimate partner violence (IPV). Accordingly, the purpose of this article is to review our current knowledge, with a focus on the sociodemographic factors that make this population particularly vulnerable to abuse. Future research directions include using more diverse Black samples, considering how living at the intersection of multiple forms of oppression shapes Black women's experience with violence, exploring the influence of historical events & oppressive images on victimization, & focusing on survivors' resilience & activism. 1 Table, 18 References.

Intimate Partner Violence and Use of Welfare Services among California Women

Author: Kimerling, Rachel1; Baumrind, Nikki1 National Center Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Palo Alto VA Health Care System, CA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61454525?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study is a population-based investigation of the association between past-year exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) & current welfare use, while also accounting for the effects of other violence experienced in adulthood & symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These data indicate that acute exposure to intimate partner violence is significantly over-represented among women currently on welfare. However, it appears to be a woman's cumulative exposure to interpersonal violence & associated symptoms of PTSD that are uniquely associated with welfare participation. These data highlight the prevalence of violence against women & its consequences for this population. Results suggest that the prevention & detection of violence is an important welfare issue, & highlight the need for more research in this area. 3 Tables, 31 References.

Across the public/private boundary: contextualising domestic violence in South Africa

Author: Bassadien, Shahana Rasool1; Hochfeld, Tessa1 Department of Comparative Social Policy at Oxford University. E-mail: shahana@telkomsa.net

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61651809?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article we plan to challenge two aspects of the public/private dichotomy based on its relevance in the South African context. Firstly, we question the assumption that women's experiences of violence are private and thus a secret, and secondly we assert that the notion of the 'public' includes social discourses on domestic violence that have not been adequately acknowledged and addressed. These discourses are powerful in determining women's decisions to act (or not) after experiencing domestic violence, and hence are potentially harmful to women. We conclude that the way the theoretical notion of the public vs private is understood fundamentally shapes intellectual and service responses. The result is that service providers, when working with survivors of abuse, are still operating from the base of inappropriate imported theories that neglect to explain domestic violence in convincing, local ways, which means that opportunities for assistance to women and men are lost.

Restorative justice and domestic violence: some exploratory thoughts

Author: Hargovan, Hema11 University of KwaZulu-Natal. E-mail: Hargovanh@ukzn.ac.za

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61601945?accountid=14925

Abstract: Restorative justice as a framework for working with victims and offenders in the aftermath of crime has been adopted in a variety of processes and contexts over the years. This focus critically examines the restorative justice approach in criminal justice with special reference to its applicability to domestic violence cases. Despite the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act of 1998, violence against women in South Africa continues unabated. The second part of the focus outlines specific provisions in the Act and proposes possibilities for integration of restorative principles. The focus concludes that a prerequisite for successful integration of restorative options is the development of regulatory frameworks and minimum standards in restorative justice practice.

Intimate Partner Violence and Monogamy among Women in Methadone Treatment

Author: Hearn, Kimberly D; O'Sullivan, Lucia F; El-Bassel, Nabila; Gilbert, Louisa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61337797?accountid=14925

Abstract: It is now becoming clear how important it is to understand women's HIV risk in the context of their sexual relationships with male partners, particularly among more vulnerable populations of women such as drug-involved women and women with physically abusive partners. Drawing from in-depth interviews with a sample of 38 ethnically diverse women, this study explores the meanings of monogamy and concurrent sexual partnerships in the relationships of women in methadone treatment with a history of physical abuse. Moreover, the ways in which having a history of intimate partner violence influences women's desire and ability to insist on monogamy is addressed. The women's narratives indicated that the majority valued monogamy and reported practicing it; however, many women were indifferent to this ideal or were unable to challenge non-monogamous partners for fear of severe reprisals. In addition, men's suspicions about violations of monogamy on the part of the women often resulted in extreme violence.

Exploring Alternative Pathways Out of Poverty: Making Connections between Domestic Violence and Employment Practices

Author: Costello, Mayet1; Chung, Donna; Carson, Ed1 U South Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59978334?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article we report on the research findings from our exploratory study examining connections between Australian responses to two important social issues: domestic violence & employment. Although international literature particularly from North America, comprehensively addresses the connections between domestic violence & employment, there is a paucity of Australian research on this topic. Intrigued by this as both practitioners & researchers, we sought to discover whether the problems, solutions & conclusions addressed internationally were relevant to an Australian context. The result was a unique contribution to Australian knowledge & practice where we demonstrate the applicability of some aspects of North American approaches to Australia & document innovative local practices in the field. In this article we argue for a more comprehensive approach in responses to the connections between domestic violence & employment as an alternative pathway out of poverty for women affected by domestic violence. 22 References.

'Why Is a Woman Still Not Safe When She's in Her Home?': Seven Years of NIBRS Data on Victims and Offenders of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Vazquez, Salvador1; Stohr, Mary K; Skow, Karen; Purkiss, Marcus1 c/o Stohr -- Dept Criminal Justice, Boise State U, ID

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60028490?accountid=14925

Abstract: The descriptors of intimate partner violence at the state level have rarely been empirically explored. In this examination of seven years of one state's National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data, we delineate the descriptors of victims, offenders, their relationships & the extent of injury sustained by the victims. We discovered that our findings mirror those of the best national victimization studies in three important respects: the victims of IPV tend to be female, young & disproportionately minority; the offenders tend to be male & slightly older than the victim; & injuries & offenses against female victims were more serious than those experienced by males. 8 Tables, 3 Figures, 58 References.

War against the Family: Domestic Violence and Human Rights in Russia - A View from the Bashkortostan Republic

Author: Zakirova, Venera

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811958252?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although the former Soviet totalitarian structures are being dismantled, new forms of political, economic and social organizations are not yet in place. In Communist Russia, the family as an ideological institution shaped official family policy. The contemporary transformation of Russian society has inevitably touched family life and women's roles within it. This article presents an analysis of domestic violence in Russia, and makes recommendations for social action, legislation, social condemnation and the women's movement.

Intergenerational Transmission of Domestic Violence: Evidence for Colombian Families

Author: Salas Bahamon, Luz Magdalena11 Subdireccion General Dept Nacional Planeacion lsalas@dnp.gov.co

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60016002?accountid=14925

Abstract: With information from the CEDE 2003 survey, conducted to 2295 women in Bogota, Barranquilla & Barrancabermeja, reproduction mechanisms of domestic violence were studied, particularly, severe physical mistreatment against women, from one generation to the next. Using probit models, factors that determine if a woman can be physically mistreated by her partner, given that he grew up in a violent & non-violent home, & factors that determine if a woman gets divorced from her violent partner, given that she grew up in a violent & non-violent home, were estimated. The results show how domestic violence is transmitted from generation to generation by learning (life experiences at home); nevertheless, there are mechanisms that break out the cycle of violence & reduce the proportion of families that reproduce aggressive behaviors in the next generation. Following Pollak's methodology (2002), divorce is the mechanism that reduces the most the level of domestic violence in some cities of Colombia, going from 33.4% of violent homes to 15.7%, in the long term. Assuming assortative mating, the level of domestic violence decreases to 14.8%. Simulation exercises, such as the increase in women education level, greater job opportunities & more access to health services, reduces the number of violent homes in the long term. Other variables related to family decision making were also analyzed. Graphs, 2 Diagrams, Appendixes, References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Lundy, Marta1; Grossman, Susan F1 School Social Work, Loyola U, Chicago, IL mlundy@luc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61296644?accountid=14925

Abstract: As the visibility of domestic violence (DV) continues to increase, so too does our awareness of the needs of the children in violent families. This study documents the various needs & problems of over 40,000 children as reported by their battered caretakers. What follows is a description of the findings from data collected between 1990 & 1995 from approximately 50 DV agencies in a Midwestern state. The findings indicate that large proportions of children had emotional & social problems whereas about one quarter had physical health & educational difficulties. Common problems included being very protective of family members, discipline issues, mood swings, & difficulty leaving parents. The implications of these findings & ideas for future planning are identified. Tables, Appendixes, References. Adapted from the source document.

HIV and Domestic Violence: Intersections in the Lives of Married Women in India

Author: Desai, Sapna

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61350802?accountid=14925

Abstract: Gender inequality is driving two distinct yet interlinked epidemics among women in India: HIV & AIDS & domestic violence. As domestic violence is increasingly recognized & HIV infection expands, policy & programs do not reflect the interlinked risks & consequences in married women's lives. This article seeks to establish the nexus between HIV & AIDS & domestic violence & identify potential areas for a state-led response. In a health & human rights approach, it assesses women's vulnerability to each epidemic at the individual, societal, & program levels to analyze direct & underlying factors that determine women's risk. Three areas are identified as opportunities for an integrated response: strengthen HIV & domestic violence strategies & address their overlap; mainstream gender; & improve data & research. References. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Among Women in a Migrant Community in Southwest Nigeria

Author: Owoaje, Eme T1; Olaolorun, Funmilola M1 Department of Community Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, PMB5116, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria emeowoaje@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61425850?accountid=14925

Abstract: This descriptive cross sectional study was conducted to determine attitudes to and the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) among women of reproductive age in a migrant community in southwest Nigeria. All consenting females aged 15-49 years in the area sampled were interviewed. A structured questionnaire administered in the local language was used to obtain information on attitudes toward IPV in seven hypothetical situations as well as their exposure to IPV. Eighty-seven percent of women had ever experienced IPV, while 20% experienced IPV in the preceding 12 months. Regarding attitudes to IPV, 79.5% of women believed that wife beating was justified in at least one of seven situations. Respondents who were not living with a male partner were more likely than their counterparts who were married/cohabiting to accept IPV (p = 0.03). There is a need for a cultural reorientation through appropriate health education interventions. Adapted from the source document.

Men's Arrack Drinking And Domestic Violence Against Women In A Bangladeshi Village

Author: Karim, K M Rabiul11 Department of Social Work, University of Rajsbahi, Rajshahi 6205, Bangladesh rkarimsw@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61365329?accountid=14925

Abstract: Arrack, indigenously made and known as tari, is a widely-used alcoholic beverage among poor drinkers in rural Bangladesh. This study examines the influences of men's arrack drinking habits on violence against women at the family level in Parbattipur, a typical village of northwest Bangladesh. Fifty purposively-selected married male arrack drinkers as well as their wives were interviewed singly by using a semi-structured questionnaire. Results show that arrack drinkers suffer from behavioral abnormalities. It creates family problems and women are often victimized by their husbands' drunken behaviors. Although violence against women is a common phenomenon in rural Bangladesh, it is argued that men's habitual arrack drinking behaviors, through the interplay of a patriarchal family structure, are directly linked with incidences of violence against women within marriage. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Repeat Victimization

Author: McLean, Maxwell11 West Yorkshire Police, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59983692?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper seeks to establish domestic violence as the most prevalent repeated, criminal offence of our time. The author makes use of his experience in introducing the United Kingdom's first ever Repeat Victimiaztion Methodology to the crime of domestic violence, implemented in Killingbeck Division, Leeds. He seeks to show that early structured intervention does reduce repeated attendances & that significant achievements can be made with little or no extra resources. The paper demonstrates, by reference to a murder case study, the tragic consequences of agencies' failure to share information. A number of policy recommendations are made for consideration by governments, many of which are now being implemented in the United Kingdom. 7 Figures, 5 References.

The Disassociation between Domestic Violence Service Provision and Multi-Agency Initiatives on Domestic Violence

Author: Welsh, Kirsty11 Centre Criminological Research, Dept Law, U Sheffield, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59997827?accountid=14925

Abstract: In recent years in England & Wales, the multi-agency approach has come to be increasingly promoted in government circles as a response in domestic violence. In this article, I reflect on doctoral research to question the assumption that the multi-agency approach should be celebrated as a leading response to the problem. Rather, I argue that such approaches increase neither women's protection nor their safety. Focusing on findings from two research areas in Northern England, I argue that there was a separation or disassociation between multi-agency domestic violence initiatives & service provision in these areas. I illustrate the argument using three examples from the research. Other issues are important in founding the argument that such approaches are not increasing women's protection or safety. These issues centre on the interaction between service provision & prevention. I argue that, because appropriate service provision is essential in preventing domestic violence, an approach that is not grounded in service provision but is disassociated from it can do little to prevent domestic violence & protect women.

A Coordinated Response to Intimate Partner Violence: Lessons from an Exploratory Study

Author: Slaght, Evelyn1; Hamilton, Nina1 School Social Work, Illinois State U, Normal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61367652?accountid=14925

Abstract: A qualitative study of two Family Violence Coordinating Councils in Illinois confirmed the importance of collaboration between the law enforcement & treatment communities in responding to the needs of families enmeshed in domestic violence. A key finding of the study is that a joint philosophy of intervention is crucial to effective coordination. As key actors change, training is needed to reemphasize the special needs of batterers & victims, so that emphasis on prosecution does not preclude treatment. The judiciary, the State's Attorney's Office, probation, treatment programs, the medical community, the child welfare agency, & the clergy need to be invested in the coordinating process. Multimodal treatment services are needed, & must be supported by law enforcement. Data documenting the impact of intervention on intimate partner violence should be routinely collected to assess the effectiveness of a coordinated response in reducing recidivism. 20 References.

The Parallels between Undue Influence, Domestic Violence, Stalking, and Sexual Assault

Author: Brandl, Bonnie1; Heisler, Candace J; Stiegel, Lori A1 c/o Stiegel -- ABA Commision Law & Aging, Washington, DC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61631765?accountid=14925

Abstract: The dynamics of undue influence (UI) have many similarities with domestic violence, stalking, & grooming behavior used by some sexual predators. This article will help practitioners -- particularly law enforcement investigators & prosecutors -- better recognize UI as a pattern of behaviors, not an isolated incident. Understanding the dynamics of UI will enhance professionals' appreciation of the responses of victims & the manipulative nature of exploiters. Strategies that have been used effectively with domestic violence, stalking, & some sexual abuse cases may provide remedies for victims of UI & criminal justice options for holding perpetrators accountable. Enhanced awareness of these dynamics should lead to improved investigations, more effective strategies when interviewing & working with victims, & more successful prosecutions of perpetrators who use UI to financially exploit an older person.

Internal Barriers to Help Seeking for Middle-Aged and Older Women Who Experience Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Beaulaurier, Richard L1; Seff, Laura R; Newman, Frederick L; Dunlop, Burton1 School Social Work, Coll Health & Urban Affairs, Florida International U, Miami

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61387237?accountid=14925

Abstract: There has been relatively little qualitatively or quantitatively published research to guide the field in identifying & addressing barriers to seeking help for older women who experience domestic violence. Women over the age of 45 have seldom been participants in research on domestic violence. This paper describes results from a qualitative study that focused on reactions to & internalization of abusive behaviors of an intimate partner. Twenty-one focus groups were conducted with 134 middle-aged & older women. Analysis of the data identified six factors that describe reactions to abusive behavior that become barriers to help seeking, including self-blame, powerlessness, hopelessness, the need to protect family, & the need to keep such abuse secret from others. These findings are discussed with implications for community outreach & future research. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Precinct Domestic Violence Teams: Whose Goals should Determine Program Activities?

Author: Weisz, Arlene N1; Black, Beverly M; Nahan, Neva1 School Social Work, Wayne State U, Detroit, MI

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61380421?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes an urban community's attempts to increase domestic violence survivors' participation in the criminal justice system by combining social work advocacy, specialized police officers, & prosecutors into precinct domestic violence teams. An analysis of the outcomes of 1,057 domestic violence reports found that the presence of the teams did not result in increased survivor participation in prosecution. A survey of 265 of the survivors indicated that prosecution was rarely a goal of the survivors, whose participation was needed to meet the goals of the criminal justice system. This study illustrates the importance of learning the views of people that interventions are designed to help. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Rountree, Michele A11 School Social Work, U Texas, Austin

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61387956?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this exploratory study is to identify the current practices & barriers related to the use of HIV/AIDS risk assessment measures & the provision of HIV/AIDS prevention services in seven domestic violence shelters in Arizona. Interviewees reported several structural impediments to the integration of risk assessment measures & educational/prevention services related to HIV/AIDS including fiscal constraints, enhanced training of staff, hiring of new staff, discrimination by staff & a need for an interdisciplinary approach. Client factors included the stage of recovery potentially interfering with the risk assessment measure process & the behavioral integration of HIV/AIDS education & preventative information. 33 References.

Domestic Violence: Focus Groups from the Survivors' Perspective

Author: Dziegielewski, Sophia F1; Campbell, Katharine; Turnage, Barbara F1 School Social Work, U Cincinnati, OH

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397598?accountid=14925

Abstract: As our communities & families are faced with the growing problem of violence, more information is needed as to what women in abusive relationships see as challenges that prevent or delay leaving. To address the issue in the brief therapeutic environment, 14 women in counseling for abuse agreed to participate in three task groups & were asked to identify & rank-order the challenges they faced that could prevent them from leaving. Group one included women who had a desire to leave but were not sure they could. Group two was women working on a case plan but who still had concerns; &, the third group was women who had left the relationship & were expecting not to return. Overall, when analyzing & comparing these groups, all women (regardless of the stage of leaving) expressed similar challenges & concerns. Major themes presented in all groups included: Limited resources (eg, money, shelter, daycare & medical expenses), fears (eg, fear of being killed, retaliation, being alone, making the wrong choices, the unknown), commitment to the relationship, concern for children, love for the abuser & other emotional issues. These challenges are discussed & specific applications to facilitate practice are made. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Exploring the Relevance of Attachment Theory as a Dependent Variable in the Treatment of Women Mandated into Treatment for Domestic Violence Offenses

Author: Carney, Michelle Mohr1; Buttell, Frederick P1 School Social Work, U Georgia, Athens mmcarney@uga.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61371304?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: The purpose of the study was to: (a) investigate the pre-treatment levels of interpersonal dependency & violence among women entering a 16-week, court-mandated, batterer intervention program (BIP) & determine if there were any associations between interpersonal dependency & violence; (b) investigate differences in demographic variables & psychological variables between treatment completers & drop-outs; & (c) evaluate the treatment effect of a standard BIP in altering levels of interpersonal dependency among treatment completers. Method: The study employed a secondary analysis of 75 women, 39 treatment completers & 36 drop-outs. Results: Analysis indicated that women who assault their intimate partners & are court-ordered into treatment are excessively dependent on their partners prior to beginning treatment, that level of interpersonal dependency is directly related to a multidimensional conceptualization of domestic violence (i.e., psychological aggression, physical assault, sexual coercion & injury), that interpersonal dependency is an important variable in predicting treatment completion & that the BIP increased the level of interpersonal dependency among treatment completers. Conclusion: Implications of the findings for professionals providing intervention services to women in court-mandated batterer intervention programs were explored & discussed. Tables, References.

Personality Profiles of Women and Men Arrested for Domestic Violence: An Analysis of Similarities and Differences

Author: Simmons, Catherine A1; Lehmann, Peter; Cobb, Norman; Fowler, Carol R1 School Social Work, U Texas, Arlington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61374152?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women arrested for intimate partner violence raise challenges for those working in domestic violence programs. Theoretically, there is no agreement about whether women are aggressive for the same reasons as men or merely victims fighting back in an abusive relationship. Practically, there is very little research to guide treatment of this population. In the current exploratory study, Millon Clinical Multiaxial InventoryIII (MCMI-III) personality profiles of 78 females referred by the courts to a domestic violence diversion program were compared to those of a matched sample of 78 males referred by the courts to the same program. Compared with male offenders, women were more likely to demonstrate elevated histrionic, narcissistic, & compulsive personality traits, & less likely to demonstrate dependant personality traits. Additionally, women in this study were more likely to display MCMI-III profiles indicating the presence of personality disorders. Implications of these findings for the treatment setting are discussed. Tables, Graphs, References. Adapted from the source document.

Investigating Intersections between Gender and Intimate Partner Violence Recidivism

Author: Renauer, Brian1; Henning, Kris1 Portland State U, OR renauer@pdx.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61380734?accountid=14925

Abstract: Mandatory & preferred arrest policies for domestic violence (DV) have led to an increase in DV arrests & prosecutions of male & female suspects. The strain of this increase on criminal justice resources suggests a need for prioritizing DV cases & determining suspects most at risk for recidivism & victimization. The present study sought to address a largely ignored question in the field of DV: who is more likely to recidivate, male or female DV offenders involved with the criminal justice system? Two forms of recidivism were coded using subsequent police reports for DV: recidivism as a suspect & recidivism as a victim. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the ways in which male & female DV offenders recidivate. Males were more likely to recidivate as a suspect & females were more likely to be listed as a future DV victim in police reports. Male & female offenders also significantly differed in the frequency of their recidivism. Gender, independent of other factors, was reliably associated with both forms of recidivism & a similar pattern of recidivism was found in two different cities. There was, however, a small group of female offenders in both cities who appear to be primary aggressors. Another grouping of female offenders appears to be involved in relationships characterized by mutual aggression & bi-directional violence. Together these two groups account for roughly a quarter of the women in our sample. The implications of the findings for arrest practices, treatment & interventions, & using gender as a risk factor are discussed. Validity & reliability problems with using police reports as a measure of DV recidivism are also reviewed. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

The Meaning of Dating Violence in the Lives of Middle School Adolescents: A Report of a Focus Group Study

Author: Fredland, Nina M1; Ricardo, Izabel B; Campbell, Jacquelyn C; Sharps, Phyllis W; Kub, Joan K; Yonas, Michael1 School Nursing, Johns Hopkins U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61352553?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports qualitative findings of seven focus groups that illuminate the phenomenon of dating & dating violence from the perspective of the young adolescent. This study was part of a larger intervention project, "An Arts-Based Initiative for the Prevention of Violence Against Women & Girls," a collaboration of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention & Johns Hopkins University, School of Nursing. Concepts of interest included: dating norms, ecological factors, elements of healthy & unhealthy relationships, & prevention strategies. Four themes emerged: respect versus disrespect, influence of friends, cost & benefit of sexual activity & violence as an acceptable response. The implications of this data highlight the need for school personnel to increase their awareness & understanding of the challenges middle school youth face. Dating violence prevention programs should be designed accordingly. References. Adapted from the source document.

Exploring the Effects of Head Injuries among Battered Women: A Qualitative Study of Chronic and Severe Woman Battering

Author: Roberts, Albert R1; Kim, Jung H1 Dept Administration Justice, Livingston Coll, Rutgers U, Piscataway, NJ prof.albertroberts@comcast.net

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382054?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study examined the link between chronic woman battering & head injuries in a sample of 52 battered women. The voices of the women in terms of the qualitative data revealed that severe & repeated women battering seems to be associated with head injuries, flashbacks, insomnia, major depression & nightmares of the batterer killing the victim. The research findings support the need for neurological workups among battered women with severe head injuries to rule out temporal lobe epilepsy, & other traumatic brain injuries. It is imperative that battered women be assessed & screened for neurological injuries as well as mental disorders so that appropriate medical & mental health services can be provided. Social workers & psychiatric nurses in hospital emergency rooms & other medical settings are in a pivotal role to detect & facilitate intervention for battered women with neurological injuries & mental disorders.

How to Make the Law Work? Budgetary Implications of Domestic Violence Laws in Latin America, Central America, and the Caribbean

Author: Luciano, Dinys1; Esim, Simel; Duvvury, Nata1 Pan American Health Organization, Gender & Ethnicity Unit, Washington, DC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59979959?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study focuses on budgetary implications of domestic violence (DV) laws in the Latin American, Central American, & Caribbean (LAC) region. It is based on a survey of literature & data on DV legislation, literature reviews on the social & economic costs of DV, & an analysis of policies on DV in the region based on a survey of nonprofits working on DV in the region. The study shows DV is not being mainstreamed into ministerial budget line items as would be expected following the passage of law. There is clearly a difference between what is ratified in laws & the implementation of activities that follows those decisions. Funding for DV programs is insufficient to reach the entire target population & address the magnitude of the problem. Even after laws were passed, major sources of funding for DV services have continued to be discretionary funds from the ministries' budgets & international donor funds. References.

The Importance of Expectation Fulfilment on Domestic Violence Victims' Satisfaction with the Police in the UK

Author: Robinson, Amanda L1; Stroshine, Meghan S1 School Social Sciences, Cardiff U, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60009582?accountid=14925

Abstract: Purpose: This paper seeks to investigate what victims of domestic violence expect police to do for them, & how these expectations subsequently influence their levels of satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: Structured interviews with 222 victims of domestic violence were conducted by staff from an integrated community-based service delivery agency in Cardiff, Wales. Multivariate analyses were performed to reveal the factors that contribute to domestic violence victims' satisfaction with the police. Findings: Consistent with the expectancy disconfirmation model, results indicate that the most important determinant of satisfaction is the extent to which victims' expectations about police behaviour & demeanour are fulfilled. Originality/value: The results of this study & implications for police policy are discussed. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

The Journey to Resiliency: An Integrative Framework for Treatment for Victims and Survivors of Family Violence

Author: Cairns-Descoteaux, Bonita11 Roberts Wesleyan Coll, Rochester, NY Descoteauxb@roberts.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61367941?accountid=14925

Abstract: The model presented in this article provides a framework for working with victims of family violence that differs from other integrative frameworks in the professional literature by including a spiritual dimension. There are four parts to the model that are discussed in this paper: development of a healthy self-concept, connection to a loving God, healing of memories, & consolidating personal growth. The article begins with a process to assess clients, based on their journey towards resiliency. Using this assessment as a basis for intervention, the social worker can begin working with the client, using the four phases in this model. References. Adapted from the source document.

The Role of Alcohol Use and Depression in Intimate Partner Violence among Black and Hispanic Patients in an Urban Emergency Department

Author: Lipsky, Sherry1; Caetano, Raul; Field, Craig A; Bazargan, Shahrzad1 Dallas Regional Campus, U Texas Houston School Public Health

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61510496?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to assess the role of alcohol use & depression in intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization & perpetration among Blacks & Hispanics in an underserved urban emergency department population. Methods: This cross-sectional study surveyed male & female patients presenting to an urban emergency department. The outcome measures were physical or sexual IPV victimization & perpetration in the previous 12 months. The independent predictors included demographic variables, alcohol & drug use, & depressive symptoms. Logistic regression analyses calculated the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) & 95% confidence interval (CI) for predictors of IPV victimization & perpetration in separate models. Results: The prevalence of IPV victimization among Blacks & Hispanics were similar (14% & 10%, respectively) but blacks were nearly twice as likely to report IPV perpetration (17% vs. 9%, respectively).Predictors of IPV perpetration were Black race, married or living with a partner, heavy drinking, illicit drug use, & current depression. Depression, but not substance use, also predicted IPV victimization, in addition to Black race, married or living with a partner, & younger age. Conclusions: Screening for substance abuse & depression in an inner city emergency department population may help to identify individuals at high risk of IPV, particularly IPV perpetration. 3 Tables, 53 References.

Domestic Violence at the Intersections of Race, Class, and Gender: Challenges and Contributions to Understanding Violence against Marginalized Women in Diverse Communities

Author: Sokoloff, Natalie J1; Dupont, Ida1 John Jay Coll Criminal Justice, City U New York

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60006441?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article provides a comprehensive review of the emerging domestic violence literature using a race, class, gender, sexual orientation intersectional analysis & structural framework fostered by women of color & their allies to understand the experiences & contexts of domestic violence for marginalized women in U.S. society. The first half of the article lays out a series of challenges that an intersectional analysis grounded in a structural framework provides for understanding the role of culture in domestic violence. The second half of the article points to major contributions of such an approach to feminist methods & practices in working with battered women on the margins of society. References.

The Composite Abuse Scale: Further Development and Assessment of Reliability and Validity of a Multidimensional Partner Abuse Measure in Clinical Settings

Author: Hegarty, Kelsey; Bush, Robert; Sheehan, Mary

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61329889?accountid=14925

Abstract: Absence of a well-validated comprehensive partner abuse questionnaire has been a major methodological issue in domestic violence research. A new multidimensional measure of partner abuse, the Composite Abuse Scale (CAS), has four dimensions: Severe Combined Abuse, Emotional Abuse, Physical Abuse, and Harassment. A general practice patient sample (N = 1,836) has been used in the development and testing of CAS. Factor analyses in this current study confirmed the four dimensions from a preliminary nurses sample study and resulted in a final scale of 30 items consisting of acts of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. These four factors exhibited good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha > 0.85) and the corrected item-total correlations were high (> 0.5). Evidence of criterion and construct validity is presented. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT].

Women Police Stations as a Dispute Processing System: The Tamil Nadu Experience in Dealing with Dowry-Related Domestic Violence Cases

Author: Natarajan, Mangai11 John Jay Coll Criminal Justice, City U, New York, NY mnataraj@jjay.cuny.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59998991?accountid=14925

Abstract: In 1992, the Tamil Nadu State government in India began to introduce all-women police stations whose primary role is to deal with crimes against women, including family violence & dowry disputes. Dowry giving is a customary practice in India, which often results in disputes between young wives & their new families. As a result, the young women may be subjected to physical & mental ill treatment, sometimes resulting in death. Using detailed data from 474 case records & interviews with 60 dowry victims, the present study examines how women police stations serve as a dispute processing system, & describes the services extended by the stations to the victims of dowry disputes. Many cases were successfully resolved & violence was frequently reduced. The study holds implications for the extension of training in dispute resolution for women police in India.

Specialized Domestic Violence Courts: Improvement for Women Victims?

Author: Coulter, Martha L1; Alexander, Abigail; Harrison, Victoria1 Department of Community and Family Health, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, and Director The Jennifer and James Harrell Center for the Study of Family Violence, 13201 Bruce B.

Abstract: The multimethod study assesses the perceptions of specialized domestic violence courts' processes with victims' experiences as the central focus. Perceptions of the traditional courts and specialized domestic violence courts are compared among victims, courtroom police, attorneys, judges and victim advocates. Domestic violence education among attorneys, judges, and victim advocates is also compared. Despite the intended improvements with the specialized court model, victims report similar problems in both court models. Safety and victims support among respondents is mixed. Professionals from the specialized court receive no more domestic violence education than those from the general court. Victims' and courtroom police recommendations are presented.

Exploring Agreement on Appropriate Responses to Domestic Violence and Sexual Trauma Across Victim Advocates, Mental Health Service Providers, and Substance Abuse Treatment Providers

Author: Herz, Denise C1; Stroshine, Meghan; Houser, Kristen1 School of Criminal Justice & Criminalistics, California State University, King Hall D1047, Los Angeles, CA 90032 E-mail: dherz@calstatela.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61624258?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research suggests that survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault are more at risk than the general population for substance abuse and/or mental health disorders (Kendler et al., 2000). Additionally, research suggests that survivors of both crimes are at risk to be "multiply diagnosed"-have a history of victimization, a mental health diagnosis, and abuse of alcohol and drugs (Steele & Rechberger, 2002). While advocates have called for a change in the treatment of trauma survivors to treat their multiple needs, the availability of collaborative care between victim advocates and behavioral health professionals remains questionable. Using survey data collected from victim advocates, mental health service providers, and substance abuse treatment providers, this study assesses the extent to which providers of different backgrounds agree on how to effectively and appropriately serve domestic violence and sexual assault survivors-the first step in achieving the goal of holistic care.

Changing Help-Seeking Rates for Intimate Partner Violence in Canada

Author: Du Mont, Janice1; Forte, Tonia; Cohen, Marsha M; Hyman, Ilene; Romans, Sarah1 Centre Research Womens Health, Sunnybrook & Womens Health Sciences Centre, U Toronto, ON

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61371713?accountid=14925

Abstract: The adverse physical & psychological sequelae of intimate partner violence (IPV) are well documented, as are government initiatives in Canada since the early 1990s to address the problem through public awareness campaigns & service enhancement programs. While these initiatives have been designed to encourage abused women to come forward, there has been little research examining changes over time in help-seeking rates among this group. To fill this void, we compared data from two large Canadian population-based, cross-sectional telephone surveys: the 1993 Violence Against Women Survey (1993-VAWS) & the 1999 General Social Survey (1999-GSS). Among women who reported physical &/or sexual violence by a current or previous partner, we examined differences in rates of disclosure of abuse, help-seeking by type of service, & barriers to service use. Abused women in the 1999-GSS were significantly more likely than those in the 1993-VAWS to have reported disclosing a violent incident(s) to a family member (66.4% vs. 43.9%), friend or neighbor (67.4% vs. 45.4%), doctor or nurse (31.9% vs. 23.0%), &/or minister, priest, or cleric (11.5% vs. 7.3%). The 1999-GSS cohort was also more likely to have presented to a shelter or transition house (11.0% vs. 7.8%), a crisis center(17.3% vs. 4.2%), a counselor or psychologist (39.1% vs. 14.7%), a women's center (11.2% vs. 3.4%), &/or a community or family center (15.4% vs. 4.7%). Among those women who did not seek help, fewer in the 1999-GSS reported that they did not know of any services (6.4% vs. 17.0%), or that services were not available (0.8% vs. 14.5%). Although we found a demonstrable increase in the numbers of abused women seeking help, overall, rates of service utilization were still low as late as 1999, highlighting the importance of continued government commitment to funding IPV initiatives.

Domestic Violence among Druze Women in Israel as Reflected by Health Status and Somatization Level

Author: Goldblatt, Hadass1; Granot, Michal1 Dept Nursing, U Haifa, Mount Carmel, Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612552?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women with a history of physical or emotional abuse demonstrate a higher incidence of medical disorders but may be reluctant to disclose the abuse to health care providers. The present study explored whether measures of health status may serve as an indication of violence against women. Sixty-two Druze women (18-50 years old) completed health status (SF-36 survey), somatization (Brief Symptom Inventory -- BSI), & abuse (the Abuse Assessment Screen -- AAS) questionnaires during a visit to the family physician in the community primary care clinic. Higher somatization symptoms & diminished health status were associated with severity of violence. Results attest to the value of these measures as an additional indirect device for screening victims of domestic violence in general & among traditional societies in particular. Tables, References.

Abstract: Objective: To explore the prevalence, type, frequency & causes of domestic marital violence among Turkish women in a socio-economically developed metropolitan setting. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in 2003. All married women, aged 18 years & over, who were visiting any of the 50 primary health care units for different purposes were asked to participate in the study. Of 1427 asked, 1010 gave consent & completed face-to-face interviews. Multiple correspondence analysis, & logistic regression were used for statistical analyses. Results: Domestic violence was statistically significantly associated with educational level. Illiterate women reported marital abuse 2.6 times more than university or more educated women. No statistically significant relationship was observed between domestic marital violence & women's age or occupation, marital duration or family income. The most frequently reported type of violence was physical, followed by psychological. Among women reporting domestic violence, those with the lowest educational level & income were experiencing all types of domestic violence frequently. Conclusion: Placing more importance on educating girls could be a key component of preventing domestic violence. Tables, Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

A Consumer-Behavior Perspective on Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Stephens, Debra Lynn1; Hill, Ronald Paul; Gentry, James W1 Dr. Robert B. Pamplin, Jr. School Business Administration, U Portland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60489218?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research examines women's experiences of & responses to intimate partner violence using the perspective of the extended self. From in-depth interviews with a demographically diverse group of women in the United States, the primary theme to emerge was that chronic abuse is experienced as the male partner's ongoing campaign to incorporate the abused woman into his extended self, by appropriating or destroying the aspects of her that give her autonomy. The most important implication for agencies serving abused women is that many of their clients are faced with the daunting task of repairing or reconstructing their core & extended selves, a process that may necessitate the long-term commitment of agency resources without the imposition of restricted, institutionally imposed identities that would serve only to impede clients' reclamation of their autonomy. 62 References.

Reports of Intimate Partner Violence Made Against Police Officers

Author: Erwin, Melissa J1; Gershon, Robyn R M; Tiburzi, Michael; Lin, Susan1 c/o Gershon -- Mailman School Public Health, Dept Soicomedical Sciences, Columbia U, New York, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61453038?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this case control study was to compare police officers (n = 106) from a large urban police force, charged with committing intimate partner violence (IPV) with officers who were not charged (n = 105), in order to identify risk factors for IPV. We also compared the frequency, type, & final disposition of IPV reports filed against police officers before & after the enactment of the 1994 Violence against Women Act (VAWA). Officers accused of IPV were more likely to be members of a minority, on the force more than 7 years & assigned to a high crime district. No major differences on intake baseline MMPI scores were noted between cases & controls. A significant increase in reports of IPV was noted after the enactment of VAWA; the rate changed from 0.2/100 to 1.2/100 person years, although there were too few pre-1994 reports to compare further. Most of the final dispositions of the cases resulted in cases closed due to unsupported testimony from victims. 4 Tables, 27 References. Adapted from the source document.

Hostage-Taking in the Context of Domestic Violence: Some Case Examples

Author: Van Hasselt, Vincent B1; Flood, John J; Romano, Stephen J; Vecchi, Gregory M; Fabrique, Nathalie de; Dalfonzo, Vincent A1 Nova Southeastern University, 3301 College Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, FL, 33314-7796, vanhasse@nova.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811411962?accountid=14925

Abstract: Initial reports of domestic violence are generally made to law enforcement officers who must respond and intervene. A subset of these episodes involves cases in which the victim, and, in many instances her child(ren), have been taken hostage by her husband or partner. Moreover, there are indications that the number of such incidents is growing. The purpose of this project was twofold: (1) to provide one of the first reports on the prevalence and characteristics of these events, and (2) to more closely analyze domestic crisis (hostage) situations using actual case examples. All information was obtained from the Hostage Barricade Database System (HOBAS) of the FBI's Crisis Negotiation Unit. HOBAS is a postincident information collection tool which stores historical data from law enforcement agencies across the nation on hostage/barricade incidents. An examination of this database yielded different types of domestic hostage-taking acts and outcomes (e.g., tactical vs. negotiated resolutions, survival vs. death/injury of perpetrator and/or victim[s]). Implications of the findings, for future crisis negotiation efforts directed toward nonviolent resolution of these high-risk critical incidents, are discussed.

Comparing Wife Abuse Perceptions Between Chinese Police Officers and Social Workers

Author: Tam, Suet Yan; Tang, Catherine So-kum11 The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong, ctang@cuhk.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811411970?accountid=14925

Abstract: Seventy-one Chinese social workers and 74 Chinese police officers residing in Hong Kong were surveyed on their gender-role attitudes, endorsement of wife abuse myths, and definitions of wife abuse. Results showed that compared to social workers, police officers held more conservative gender-role attitudes, endorsed more myths about wife abuse, and adopted more restrictive definitions of physical and psychological wife abuse. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that definitions of wife abuse were related to different predictors for these two groups of professionals. Among social workers, egalitarian gender-role attitudes were a significant predictor of broad definitions of physical wife abuse, but no significant predictor was found for psychological wife abuse. Among police officers, significant predictors of definitions of physical wife abuse included marital status, educational attainment, and endorsement of wife abuse myths; gender-role attitudes were the only significant predictor of definitions of psychological wife abuse.

The Effects of a Police/Victim Assistance Crisis Team Approach to Domestic Violence

Author: Corcoran, Jacqueline1; Allen, Shannon1 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Fort Worth, Texas, jcorcora@saturn.vsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811411873?accountid=14925

Abstract: A police/victim assistance crisis intervention program was evaluated over a 6-month period for its effect on police-related outcomes. Police report data on crisis team cases (N = 96) were compared to a random selection of family violence cases (N = 80) that were not served by the crisis team. The crisis team cases generated more arrests; however, victim cooperation was lower than in noncrisis intervention cases. Implications for work with family violence and victim assistance are discussed, as well as needs for future research.

Domestic Violence between Same-Gender Partners: Recent Findings and Future Research

Author: McClennen, Joan C11 Southwest Missouri State U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60537118?accountid=14925

Abstract: Empirical literature about same-gender domestic violence was relatively nonexistent until the past 20 years, & conducting research with this population about a sensitive topic remains a daunting endeavor. Existing studies reveal similarities between opposite- & same-gender domestic violence in prevalence, types of abuse, & various dynamics, as well as dispel myths & establish a theoretical basis on which to conduct future research. Differences are evident in areas such as help-seeking behaviors & correlates, thus demanding unique assessment & intervention strategies. This article presents further explanation of the latest research, recommendations for future studies, & effective as well as problematic methodological practices about same-gender domestic violence. 14 References.

The Utility of Male Domestic Violence Offender Typologies: New Directions for Research, Policy, and Practice

Author: Cavanaugh, Mary M1; Gelles, Richard J1 U Pennsylvania

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60510583?accountid=14925

Abstract: The development of empirically based behavioral & psychological typologies provides clear evidence that offenders vary across types. A review & synthesis of the literature reveals three types of batterers common across current typology research -- a low, moderate, & high-risk offender. Examination of these types demonstrates that most male offenders do not escalate over time from low to high levels of risk. This observation refutes previous claims regarding a common consensus among researchers that battering escalates in frequency & intensity over time. There are particular characteristics specific to each type that establish thresholds distinct to each classification. Thus, it is unlikely that an offender will move from one type to another. Interventions targeted to address the needs of subsamples of offenders can lead to more effectively protecting those most at risk for future violence. Addressing the issue of woman battering through the prism of typologies has significant implications for research, policy, & practice. 2 Tables, 28 References.

Culture and Domestic Violence: Transforming Knowledge Development

Author: Bent-Goodley, Tricia B11 School Social Work, Howard U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61544449?accountid=14925

Abstract: Cultural competence continues to receive limited attention in domestic violence service provision from research to the evaluation of programs. Yet with changing demographics reflecting larger numbers of people of color & increasing needs for more effective responses, it is critical that we change the way we think about domestic violence. Using a feminist framework, this article examines how knowledge has been developed in domestic violence & its consequence related to service provision & perceptions. The article ends with recommendations as to how to better include culturally competent responses in domestic violence. 44 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61513777?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article is a response to three questions posed by the editor about past & future research on interpersonal violence by focusing in this essay on domestic violence: (a) What is the most important thing we have learned about this social problem in the last 20 years, (b) what is the most important thing we need to learn about it in the next 10 years, & (c) what is the most promising methodological innovation in the last 20 years for the study or treatment of domestic violence? This assessment suggests that the field has witnessed considerable advances in domestic violence research & policy but that many as yet untapped opportunities exist to improve both knowledge & practice. 21 References.

Exciting Discoveries on the Health Effects of Family Violence: Where We Are, Where We Need to Go

Author: Kendall-Tackett, Kathleen11 Family Research Lab, Crimes Against Research Center, U New Hampshire

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60523825?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the 20 years since the founding of the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, there have been exciting new discoveries on the long-term physical health effects of family violence. As exciting as these discoveries have been, we still know little about why the experience of family violence makes people sick. Some of the most promising areas of study on this topic will be in neuroscience, sleep studies, & cognitive variables such as hostility. Once we understand mechanisms, we can design interventions that can ameliorate these effects. 21 References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2005.]

Socioeconomic Resources, Gender Traditionalism, and Wife Abuse in Urban Russian Couples

Author: Cubbins, Lisa A1; Vannoy, Dana1 Battelle Seattle Research Center, WA cubbinsl@battelle.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60506669?accountid=14925

Abstract: Until recently, Soviet data restrictions led to limited knowledge about wife abuse in Russia. This study adds to emerging research on Russian domestic violence by testing hypotheses derived from resource theory on the effects on wife abuse of husband's absolute resources vs spouses' relative resources. Analysis of data from the 1996 National Survey of Russian Marriages (N= 664) shows support only for the influence of husband's absolute socioeconomic resources (education, employment status, & occupational rank). As in US studies, intergenerational patterns of wife abuse & husband's alcohol use have notable effects on wife abuse. The findings suggest that although resource theory may partly explain wife abuse in urban Russia, spouses' relative resources & husband's gender traditionalism currently have little influence. 4 Tables, 54 References.

A Paradigm for Developing a Comprehensive Treatment Protocol for Survivors of Domestic Violence

Author: Espinoza, Henry11 Pan American Health Organization, Washington, DC espinozh@paho.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61393888?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article proposes a paradigm for developing a comprehensive treatment protocol for survivors of domestic violence. Domestic violence includes varying forms of physical sexual, psychological, and economic abuse against women, and its solution requires more than the mere treatment of injuries in the health care system. Espinoza argues that the health care community, the police and justice system, as well as other sectors such as local government, churches, and the educational system must harmonize their prevention and treatment efforts to combat domestic violence. Despite enthusiasm for inter-agency collaboration, only limited cooperation has occurred. In order for services to be integrated, all of these different sectors must develop a common understanding of the problem of domestic violence, agreed upon goals, and share a common paradigm for joint work.

Perceptions of Dating Violence following a Sexual or Nonsexual Betrayal of Trust: Effects of Gender, Sexism, Acceptance of Rape Myths, and Vengeance Motivation

Author: Forbes, Gordon B1; Jobe, Rebecca L; White, Kay B; Bloesch, Emily; Adams-Curtis, Leah E1 Dept Behavioral Sciences, Millikin U, Decatur, IL gforbes@millikin.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60515604?accountid=14925

Abstract: College women s (N = 220) & men s (N = 208) perceptions of violence following a betrayal by a romantic partner were studied in an independent groups design that varied gender of the participant, type of betrayal (sexual or nonsexual), & gender of the betrayed individual. Participants read one of four brief vignettes in which the betrayed person slapped his/her partner & made his/her lip bleed. Justification of this action was rated on 10 items. Factor analysis of these items indicated the presence of three factors for men & four for women. Both men & women indicated that hitting the partner, getting even, & being angry were more justifiable following a sexual betrayal. The hitting of a male partner by a betrayed woman was perceived as more justified than the hitting of a female partner by a betrayed man. In absolute terms, hitting & getting even by both women & men were generally viewed as unjustifiable, whereas being angry was viewed as justifiable. For both women & men, scores on the Vengeance Scale (Stuckless & Goranson, 1992) & Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, 1995) were related to getting even. For men, the Hostile Sexism Scale (Glick & Fiske, 2001) was related to getting even or being angry & breaking up. Results indicated that perceptions of reactions to betrayal are related to type of betrayal & to the dispositional characteristics of the perceiver. 2 Tables, 41 References.

Domestic Violence, Sexual Owernship, and HIV Risk in Women in the American Deep South

Author: Lichtenstein, Bronwen11 Dept Criminal Justice, Instit Rural Health Research, U Alabama, Tuscaloosa blichten@bama.ua.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60494620?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence & sexual abuse are important correlates of HIV risk in women. This paper examines the links between HIV risk & domestic violence in women in a region with the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the United States. The theoretical framework incorporates Butler's (1993) & (1990) concept of performative gender & Collins' (2000) "controlling images" of African American women as a context for domestic violence in the Deep South. Two focus groups were convened to develop a definition of domestic violence as HIV risk; 50 in-depth individual interviews of HIV-positive women were subsequently conducted for specific information on the topic. A final focus group was conducted for verification & feedback. The interview data revealed that controlling images of women as sexualized bodies were enacted through rape, sexual coercion, & name-calling in intimate relationships. The main finding was that the women lacked the ability to control sexual activities (including condom use) in abusive relationships with HIV-positive men. The women used various strategies to escape abusive partners & to obtain treatment for HIV/AIDS. The study concludes that the links between gender inequity, domestic violence, & HIV transmission should appear in prevention materials to encourage domestic violence screening in health settings, & to provide abused women with information on the not-so-obvious risks of being infected in abusive relationships. 1 Table, 37 References.

Domestic Violence: Court Case Conviction and Recidivism

Author: Ventura, Lois A1; Davis, Gabrielle1 Dept Criminal Justice, Coll Health & Human Services, U Toledo

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368352?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the effect of convictions for domestic violence or a related charge on the recidivism of batterers. Findings indicate that convictions reduce the likelihood of domestic violence recidivism. The variance explained by the conviction variable is modest; however, conviction remains significant when the batterers' histories of domestic violence charges & other background variables are introduced. The article also explores the associations between batterers' background characteristics & court convictions, as well as the effect of sanctions on the recidivism of convicted batterers.

Police-Reported Intimate Partner Violence during Pregnancy: Who Is at Risk?

Author: Lipsky, Sherry1; Holt, Victoria L; Easterling, Thomas R; Critchlow, Cathy W1 School Public Health, U Texas Houston, Dallas sherry.lipsky@utsouthwestern.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61345562?accountid=14925

Abstract: The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to determine risk factors for police-reported intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy among Seattle residents with a registered live birth or fetal death in Washington State. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) & 95% confidence intervals for the association between demographic, behavioral, & obstetric history risk factors & any, physical, & nonphysical police-reported IPV. Significant risk factors for any police-reported IPV during pregnancy included unmarried status (aOR 2.36), public health program use (aOR 1.33), smoking or alcohol use during pregnancy (aORs 1.45 & 1.80, respectively), previous live birth (aOR 1.39), & previous spontaneous or induced abortion (aORs 1.39 & 1.34, respectively). Risk factors for physical IPV varied only slightly from those for any IPV, & fewer factors were associated with nonphysical IPV. Demographic, behavioral, & obstetric history risk factors are potential markers of IPV risk during pregnancy. 2 Tables, 1 Figure, 74 References. Adapted from the source document.

Beyond Gender: Class, Poverty and Domestic Violence

Author: Evans, Susan11 U Western Sydney evanss@wahs.nsw.gov.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61539835?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article argues there is a need for a more encompassing understanding of the relationships between domestic violence & all forms of marginalization in the Australian context. Specific attention will be given to the invisibility of class & poverty in contemporary discourse about domestic violence in the mainstream population. That there continues to be a higher prevalence of domestic violence, & more severe physical injury sustained as a result of domestic violence among population groups living with poverty, exposes the partiality of mainstream knowledges informing Australian domestic violence policy & practice. This article proposes prevention efforts must accommodate how class & the effects of poverty interlock with other aspects of social identity to shape the experience of domestic violence for people both victimized by, & perpetrating violence. 24 References.

A Study in Social Change: The Domestic Violence Prevention Movement in Taiwan

Author: Chao, Elaine

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60513568?accountid=14925

Abstract: Taiwan has dramatically improved its response to domestic violence within the last fifteen years, becoming the first East Asian country to pass major legislation criminalizing domestic violence. Ethnographic research on the origins, development, & operations of the domestic violence prevention movement shows how individuals from diverse backgrounds acted collectively to achieve this social reversal. Activists have profited from feminist social networks, the growing economic & political power of women, domestic violence models from other countries, a unified vision of creating new legislation, & an atmosphere open to change. Their efforts were catalyzed by three widely publicized cases regarding violence against women & culminated in the passage of the Domestic Violence Prevention & Treatment Act in 1998. The domestic violence prevention movement in Taiwan provides a valuable case study of social change & a model for other East Asian countries interested in passing similar legislation. Adapted from the source document.

Barriers to Domestic Violence Help Seeking: Implications for Intervention

Author: Fugate, Michelle1; Landis, Leslie; Riordan, Kim; Naureckas, Sara; Engel, Barbara1 City Chicago Mayor's Office Domestic Violence

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60012803?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data were obtained from the Chicago Women's Health Risk Study, in which 491 abused women were interviewed in public health centers & a hospital. Responses of a subgroup of these women who did not seek help through the identified interventions are examined. Common themes emerge across the help-seeking interventions studied: individual thresholds for the seriousness of the violence, a perceived requirement to end the relationship, & certain specific barriers. The responses provide a glimpse into abused women's reasons for not seeking particular interventions. Implications for public health, mental health, domestic violence counseling agencies, & the police are discussed. Tables, References.

Knowledge and Attitudes about Intimate Partner Violence among Immigrant Latinos in Rural North Carolina

Author: Moracco, Kathryn E1; Hilton, Alison; Hodges, Kathryn G; Frasier, Pamela Y1 Dept Health Behavior & Health Education, U North Carolina-Chapel Hill

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60010716?accountid=14925

Abstract: To create appropriate intimate partner violence (IPV) services for Latino immigrants, practitioners must be aware of their needs. We conducted interviews with 100 recent Latino immigrants in a rural North Carolina county. Overall, IPV was not perceived to be a problem; however, men & women differed in their perceptions. Men were more likely to agree with IPV myths, & both men & women felt that IPV had a detrimental impact on children. Many did not know about the local domestic violence agency, & knowledge about protective orders was limited. Outreach should emphasize the seriousness of IPV, adapt content for gender-specific audiences, & increase awareness about local resources. Tables, References.

Individual, Family, and Community Risk Markers for Domestic Violence in Peru

Author: Flake, Dallan F11 U Michigan dflake@umich.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368303?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study draws on an ecological framework in testing relationships between individual, family, & community characteristics & the likelihood of women experiencing domestic violence in Peru. The sample of 15,991 women was taken from the 2000 Peru Demographic & Health Survey. Logistic regression models revealed that at the individual level, low educational attainment, early union formation, & a violent family background increase a woman's likelihood of abuse. Family-level risk markers include cohabitation, large family size, partner alcohol consumption, employment, & a woman's having higher status than her husband. At the community level, living in a noncoastal area & having an urban residence increase the likelihood of abuse. Tables, References.

An African-Centered Approach to Domestic Violence

Author: Bent-Goodley, Tricia B11 School Social Work, Howard U, Washington, D.C tbent-goodley@howard.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61294371?accountid=14925

Abstract: African-centered social work offers a set of principles upon which to develop a culturally competent response to domestic violence as experienced by African American families. Finding creative & relevant solutions for addressing domestic violence can keep family members safe, identify & address abuse, & keep children in the home when appropriate. Such efforts can promote greater awareness of healthy family relationships & the empowerment of individuals to shape their lives in a healthy & safe manner. In this article, in addition to examining principles of the African-centered paradigm, the author offers specific ways in which the paradigm can be applied to domestic violence. Tables, References.

Victims of Chronic Dating Violence: How Women's Vulnerabilities Link to Their Decisions to Stay

Author: Few, April L1; Rosen, Karen H1 Dept Human Development, Blacksburg, VA alfew@vt.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61513366?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes relational & situational vulnerabilities that emerged from interviews with 28 women (7 Black & 21 White) who were victims of chronic abuse suffered at the hands of male dating partners. Based on a qualitative content analysis, we explore how these vulnerabilities relate to women's decisions to stay in their abusive relationships & consider the implications of racial differences that emerged. Prevention & intervention strategies that help women see themselves as active choice makers are discussed. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 43 References. Adapted from the source document.

Life Constraints and Psychological Well-Being of Domestic Violence Shelter Graduates

Author: Ham-Rowbottom, Kathleen A; Gordon, Erin E; Jarvis, Kelly L; Novaco, Raymond W11 University of California, Irvine, California, 92697-7085, rwnovaco@uci.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811408281?accountid=14925

Abstract: Psychosocial adjustment and life constraints of 81 domestic violence shelter graduates were examined via field interviews in the community, assessing women's current life status, satisfaction with core life domains, and violence experience, pre- and post-shelter. Psychometric scales for depression and trauma symptoms were also administered. Participants had received extensive services in either an emergency or a transitional living shelter. Although fairly satisfied across life domains, many had serious post-shelter financial hardships. Most importantly, they reported remarkably little post-shelter violence exposure, either within or outside of romantic relationships. Despite now living independently, 43% and 75% reported clinical levels of depression and trauma symptoms, respectively. In hierarchical stepwise regressions, depression was related to women's childhood sexual abuse, dissatisfaction with housing and their own parenting, and experience of financial difficulties conjoined with public assistance. Trauma symptoms were associated with childhood sexual abuse and post-shelter financial difficulties. The impaired psychosocial functioning and life difficulties of these predominantly successful domestic violence survivors highlights the need for specialized shelter intervention and continuity of care in the community.

Twenty Years of Progress in Addressing Domestic Violence: An Agenda for the Next 10

Author: Shepard, Melanie11 U Minnesota, Duluth

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60523706?accountid=14925

Abstract: The past 20 years have seen great strides in addressing violence against women by their male partners. Although the author cannot point to one single intervention or set of interventions as being the most effective, institutional reforms that have included coordinated community responses have had a positive impact. During the next 10 years, researchers must learn how to address the obstacles that prevent institutional responses from being more effective in addressing the needs of victims. 19 References.

Domestic Violence Research: What Have We Learned and Where Do We Go from Here?

Author: Stover, Carla Smith11 National Center Children Exposed Violence, Yale School Medicine Child Study Center

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61536121?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence has been an intense area of study in recent decades. Early studies helped with the understanding of the nature of perpetration, the cycle of violence, & the effect of family violence on children. More recently, studies have focused on beginning to evaluate domestic violence interventions & their effects on recidivism. This article acknowledges the importance of what we have learned about the prevalence & impact of domestic violence & explores the need for more focused effort to pinpoint interventions that are effective with perpetrators & victims. Methodological issues relevant to past intervention studies are also discussed & future research directions are outlined. 28 References.

Measuring Intimate Partner Violence (IPV): You May Only Get What You Ask for

Author: Waltermaurer, Eve11 Sociology Dept, State U New York, New Paltz

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60540261?accountid=14925

Abstract: With the goal of understanding the true extent of intimate partner violence (IPV), researchers have put tremendous effort over the past 20 years developing, revising, & assessing IPV screening instruments. The enhancements made in IPV instrumentation reflect our improved understanding of the nature of IPV. Unfortunately, as is often the case with progress, we are presently at the stage where IPV researchers have an arsenal of multiple IPV screens that are, in some cases, slightly different, whereas in others, the differences are sizeable. This article explores the evolution & variation of a sample of IPV screens. To further progress in IPV research, we must make conscious decisions concerning the best tool for our individual research. Simultaneously, we must enhance our understanding of how these IPV screening instruments overlap so that comparisons of IPV prevalence or incidence across time & population are possible. 27 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60500979?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article addresses the importance of culture within the context of domestic violence. It takes the position that to work more effectively with diverse cultural groups, the development of a full continuum of services that includes eliminating the violence & keeping families together is required. The authors believe that intervention models developed in the fields of HIV/AIDS may provide important examples for future work. 22 References.

Men's and Women's Use of Intimate Partner Violence in Clinical Samples: Toward a Gender-Sensitive Analysis

Author: Hamberger, L Kevin11 Dept Family & Community Medicine, Medical Coll Wisconsin, Racine Family Practice Center lkh@ncw.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61339216?accountid=14925

Abstract: Early research with nationally representative samples suggested that women reported initiating violence as often as men. Such research has been criticized as focusing only on participation rates, & not assessing gender differences in impact, context, & motivation for using partner violence. Furthermore, research with nationally representative samples has been largely a-theoretical & may lack relevance to those working with clinical samples. Research with clinical populations has begun to address gender similarity & differences in the commission & experience of partner violence. The present article reviews research on men's & women's partner violence using a model for examining such gender differences that incorporates key elements of partner violence, including initiation of the overall pattern of partner violence, proportional initiation rates of violent episodes, physical & mental health impacts of partner violence, behavioral & emotional responses to partner-initiated violence, motivations for using partner violence, & fearfulness of partner-initiated violence. The review concludes that, within & across clinical samples, women are disproportionately victimized by partner violence compared to men. Implications for research, clinical programs, & policy development are discussed. 69 References. Adapted from the source document.

A Comparison of Male and Female Dually Arrested Domestic Violence Offenders

Author: Feder, Lynette1; Henning, Kris1 Portland State U, OR lfeder@pdx.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61328954?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research provides information on dually arrested female defendants in domestic violence cases. The data comes from all heterosexual domestic violence cases resulting in a dual arrest from one large mid-South city during a 28-month period. Information on matched pairs of dually arrested male & female defendants (N = 317) came from multiple sources, including official criminal justice records (arrest reports & local criminal histories) as well as victim/offender interviews with both the arrestee & his/her partner. Comparisons were made between males & females in terms of their demographics, criminal histories, prior history of domestic violence (as both victim & offender), & behavior during the instant offense. Analyses revealed that these couples had ample contact, whether as victim or offender, with the criminal justice system. While there were no significant differences in partners' reports of minor & severe physical abuse, criminal justice date indicated that male arrestees demonstrated a significantly higher overall level of severity of violence than their female counterparts. Additionally, male arrestees had a more serious history of intimate partner & extrafamilial violence as well as other indicators of an antisocial lifestyle in comparison to female arrestees. To the extent that females in our cohort demonstrated less overall criminality & engaged in less severe domestic aggression, the idea of equivalency of violence between male & female arrestees must remain questionable. 4 Tables, 61 References.

Exerting Power or Striking Back: A Gendered Comparison of Motivations for Domestic Violence Perpetration

Author: Kernsmith, Poco11 School Social Work, Wayne State U, Detroit, MI poco@wayne.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60095809?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study compares the motivations for using violence & the context in which violence occurs among male & female domestic violence perpetrators. One hundred twenty-five participants in batterer intervention counseling in Los Angeles County, California, were surveyed. The sample was approximately half male & half female. Males & females were found to differ in their motivations for using violence in relationships. Females reported using violence in response to prior abuse, citing revenge & retaliation as a primary motivation. Because treatment approaches are commonly derived from the power & control model, which indicates that violence is used to gain power & control, batterer intervention counseling may not be appropriate for women, who appear more motivated by the desire to maintain personal liberties in a relationship where they have been victimized. Treatment must walk the fine line between addressing victimization issues & holding women accountable for decisions to use violence. 2 Tables, 1 Figure, 45 References.

Domestic Violence among Male and Female Patients Seeking Emergency Medical Services

Author: Phelan, Mary Beth1; Hamberger, L Kevin; Guse, Clare E; Edwards, Shauna; Walczak, Suzanne; Zosel, Amy1 Dept Emergency Medicine, Medical Coll Wisconsin, Milwaukee mbphelan@mcw.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60108832?accountid=14925

Abstract: Gender differences among a cohort of injured patients seeking emergency medical services were examined with respect to their experiences as perpetrators &/or victims of domestic violence. Contextual issues, including violence initiation, emotional & behavioral responses to partner-initiated violence, & injury frequency & severity were analyzed. Women reported male partner-initiated violence more frequently than men reported female partner-initiated violence. Behavioral responses to partner initiated violence varied. Women were more likely to report using force back & to involve law enforcement. Women were more likely to be injured in a domestic assault over their lifetime, within the last year, & at the time of recruitment. Comparison of injury severity revealed that women reported higher rates of injuries than men in all possible severity categories. Women also reported experiencing more fear than men during partner-initiated violence, as well as being subjected to larger numbers of dominating & controlling behaviors, & greater intimidation secondary to their partner's size. Understanding contextual differences in partner violence for women & men has significant implications for policy development, identification, treatment, & referral of patients identified as living in violent relationships. 6 Tables, 47 References.

Gender Symmetry in Dating Intimate Partner Violence: Does Similar Behavior Imply Similar Constructs?

Author: Cercone, Jennifer J1; Beach, Steven R H; Arias, Ileana1 Dept Psychology, U Georgia, Athens jcercone@uga.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60105563?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study examined the extent to which there is gender symmetry in the topography & experience of dating intimate partner violence (IPV). Self-report data were collected from 450 undergraduate men & women at a large Southeastern university. Perpetration & victimization rates were examined, as were context, function, & experience of fear. Results support the view that dating IPV is generally symmetrical at a topographical level, although significantly more women than men reported perpetration of severe physical assault. However, gender asymmetries were found in the context, function, & experience of fear. These findings suggest that gender-sensitive approaches are crucial to the understanding of dating IPV. 2 Tables, 2 Figures, 37 References. Adapted from the source document.

Applying the Transtheoretical Model to Female and Male Perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence: Gender Differences in Stages and Processes of Change

Author: Babcock, Julia C1; Canady, Brittany E; Senior, Ashley; Eckhardt, Christopher I1 Dept Psychology, U Houston, TX jbabcock@uh.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60097627?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Transtheoretical Model has been recently applied to men seeking services at battering intervention & prevention programs (Eekhardt, Babcock, & Homack, 2004; Murphy & Baxter, 1997). This study considers whether women arrested for intimate partner violence differ from male perpetrators in terms of stages of change & processes of change. No gender differences were found regarding stage of change. In general, all individuals presenting for treatment were in the early stages of change. The use of various processes of change was strongly related to stage of change, with individuals in the more advanced stages of change using more behavioral & experiential strategies to become nonviolent. However, except for the use of social liberation strategies, there were no gender differences in the use of the various processes. These findings suggest that the Transtheoretical Model may apply to female perpetrators equally as well as to male perpetrators. Intervention programs designed for male batterers using the Transtheoretical Model may also be helpful in the treatment of women arrested for domestic violence. 4 Tables, 1 Figure, 59 References.

Unintended Consequences of Constructing Criminal Justice as a Dominant Paradigm in Understanding and Intervening in Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Cramer, Elizabeth P11 School Social Work, Virginia Commonwealth U, Richmond

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60097648?accountid=14925

Abstract: Offers an overview of the concepts paradigm, theory, models, & techniques related to interpersonal violence (IPV). The dominant paradigms for interpreting & intervening in IPV are examined: the feminist, clinical, & criminal justice paradigms. How the use of the criminal justice system as a dominant paradigm has achieved some early goals of the battered women's movement while also generating unintended & maybe disempowering or even harmful consequences is explicated. Alternatives to the criminal justice approach are considered. 55 References. J. Zendejas

Changing Practices: The Specialised Domestic Violence Court Process

Author: Eley, Susan11 U Stirling, Scotland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60506126?accountid=14925

Abstract: Specialized domestic violence courts, initially developed in the United States of America, have been recognized by other jurisdictions including Canada, Australia & the United Kingdom. This article presents a case study of K Court in Toronto, drawing upon documentary evidence, direct observations & interviews with key informants. It is argued that the specialized domestic violence court process includes changing practices of some of the key stakeholders. Learning lessons from abroad can offer jurisdictions insights that can steer implementation of appropriate practices in the field. 35 References. Adapted from the source document.

An Integrative Review of Intimate Partner Violence among Men Who Have Sex with Men: Correlates of Victimization and Development of a Conceptual Framework

Author: Roberts, Jeffrey A11 U Kentucky

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59989229?accountid=14925

Abstract: Provides a systematic, integrative review of the literature regarding correlates of & interventions for intimate partner violence among men who have sex with men (MSM-IPV). Correlates include HIV/AIDS, substance use, relationship dynamics, power imbalances, homophobia, mental health, & help seeking & leave taking. A conceptual framework of MSM-IPV that synthesizes the extant MSM-IPV & appropriate heterosexual IPV literatures is presented. Gaps in the literature are apparent; future research directions are suggested, & the implications of MS-IPV as a public health issue are touched on. Figures, References. J. Zendejas

Abstract: The profile of the current Asian Indian population in the United States is largely an outcome of immigration policies & practices. For most immigrants, including Asian Indians, gender, class & ethnic relations get reshaped as women & men adapt to life in a foreign country. This article discusses domestic violence among the Indian diaspora in the United States with insights from the staff of the community-based women's organisation, Sakhi for South Asian Women, in New York City. It provides a general overview of the Indian population in the United States & explains how immigration policies & regulations factor into immigrant women's experiences of marriage, migration, & marital & domestic violence in a community that has been perceived as a model minority in the United States. Notions of cultural identity, family values & gender, as well as the forms of marriage & violence, are briefly examined. Emphasis is placed on the pivotal role played by Sakhi for South Asian Women in transforming domestic violence from an individual, private matter into a public issue. Tables, References.

Acculturation and Reported Intimate Partner Violence among Latinas in Los Angeles

Author: Garcia, Lorena1; Hurwitz, Eric L; Kraus, Jess F1 U California, Davis lgarcia@ucdavis.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60508738?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study sought to understand the relationship between acculturation & reporting intimate partner violence (IPV) among Latinas. A cross-sectional interviewer-administered survey was conducted at public health care clinics throughout Los Angeles County. Logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of acculturation on reporting IPV. An increasing trend of reporting IPV was observed among Latinas who were more acculturated (chi-square = 41.02, p = .0006). Highly acculturated Latinas were more likely to report IPV compared with least acculturated Latinas (prevalence odds ration = 2.18, 95% confidence level = 0.98, 4.89) & moderately acculturated Latinas were more likely to report IPV compared with least acculturated Latinas (prevalence odds ration = 1.29, 95% confidence level = 0.69, 2.43). Culturally competent IPV prevention programs may be the key to significantly reducing the number of women exposed to this serious public health problem. 4 Tables, 2 Figures, 69 References.

Examining the Impact of the Family Violence Option on Women's Efforts to Leave Welfare

Author: Hetling, Andrea1; Born, Catherine E1 University of Maryland, Baltimore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/813859691?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: The establishment of the Family Violence Option (FVO) in 1997 was met with some controversy, as critics believed waivers from time limit and work requirements would hinder women's ability to leave welfare and find employment. Method: Using administrative and interview data from Maryland, multivariate equations analyze if domestic violence disclosure, administrative documentation, or waiver use had a statistically significant affect on one year employment and welfare use outcomes of individuals. Results: Waiver holders did not differ fromnonvictims, but victims who are not documented received fewer months of welfare and earned less income. Conclusions: Findings do not indicate that FVOwaivers encourage women to stay on welfare longer. However, the poor outcomes of undocumented victims indicate that some individuals may be slipping through the cracks of a well-intentioned policy.

Community Level Effects of Gender Inequality on Intimate Partner Violence and Unintended Pregnancy in Colombia: Testing the Feminist Perspective

Author: Pallitto, Christina C1; O'Campo, Patricia1 Dept Population & Family Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health, Baltimore, MD

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59976179?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence against women, especially by intimate partners, is a serious public health problem that is associated with physical, reproductive, & mental health consequences. The effect of intimate partner violence on women's ability to control their fertility & the mechanisms through which these phenomena are related merit further investigation. Building on findings from a previous analysis in which a statistically significant relationship between intimate partner violence & unintended pregnancy in Colombia was found, this analysis examines the effect of gender inequality on this association using data from the 2000 Colombian Demographic & Health Survey. Specifically, the objective of this analysis is to explore whether gender inequality (as measured by women's autonomy, women's status, male patriarchal control, & intimate partner violence) in municipalities partially explains the association between intimate partner violence & unintended pregnancy in Colombia. Results of logistic regression analysis with multi-level data show that living in a municipality with high rates of male patriarchal control significantly increased women's odds of having an unintended pregnancy by almost four times. Also, living in a municipality with high rates of intimate partner violence increased one's odds of unintended pregnancy by more than 2.5 times, & non-abused women living in municipalities with high rates of intimate partner violence were at a significantly increased risk of unintended pregnancy. In addition, abused women living in a municipality with high personal female decision-making autonomy had more than a fourfold increased risk of having an unintended pregnancy. These findings demonstrate the need for reproductive health programs to target areas at particularly high risk for unintended pregnancy by reducing intimate partner violence & gender inequality. 4 Tables, 66 References.

A Situational Analysis of Dating Violence among Mexican American Females Associated with Street Gangs

Author: Valdez, Avelardo1; Flores, Raquel1 Graduate School Social Work, U Houston, TX

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61533577?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study focuses on situational processes associated with dating partner violence among adolescent Mexican American females in an economically disadvantaged community. Using qualitative data generated from a specific question in a life history instrument, the questionnaire was administered to 150 high-risk Mexican American gang-affiliated female respondents (ages 14 -18). To generate the analysis, the data were coded using the constructs of precursor, instigation, & violent confrontation. Identified as the precursors of these confrontations were jealousy, control & disrespect. The findings demonstrate how situational processes in dating violence are framed by gender & social structural inequality. These micro-level processes are important in that they suggest mechanisms & properties that can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of violence as it relates to the situational context & individual behavior. 75 References.

Sita's Trousseau: Restorative Justice, Domestic Violence, and South Asian Culture

Author: Goel, Rashmi11 Sturm Coll Law, U Denver

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61380070?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article focuses on the particular cultural factors that affect South Asian women who are abused & immigrant South Asian women who are abused, in particular, in the restorative justice process. By exploring cultural practices & the icon of Sita, the mythological heroine of the Ramayana, this article demonstrates how the South Asian ideals of womanhood & wifehood help to create a mind-set whereby South Asian women are reluctant to advocate for themselves & are reluctant to leave. Such a condition is contrary to the conditions & abilities assumed by the restorative justice movement for dispute resolution, inside or outside of domestic violence. It is concluded that restorative justice options are ill-suited to application among immigrant South Asian communities for domestic violence cases. References.

'I didn't do it, but if I did I had a good reason': Minimization, Denial, and Attributions of Blame Among Male and Female Domestic Violence Offenders

Author: Henning, Kris1; Jones, Angela R; Holdford, Robert1 Portland State University, PO Box 751, Portland, Oregon, 97202, khenning@pdx.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811408696?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women are increasingly being arrested and prosecuted for assaulting an intimate partner. Whereas extensive research has been conducted to identify the treatment needs of male domestic violence offenders, few studies have examined females convicted of the same charges. In the present study 1,267 men and 159 women convicted of intimate partner abuse were compared on scales assessing attributions of blame for their recent offense, minimization, denial, and socially desirable responding. Research with male offenders has identified these factors as important treatment targets, as they appear to influence an offender's risk for noncompliance and recidivism. The results of the study suggest that both male and female domestic violence offenders engage in socially desirable responding during court-ordered evaluations, that both attribute greater blame for the recent offense to their spouse/partner than they acknowledge for themselves, and that significant numbers of both genders deny the recent incident and/or minimize the severity of the offense. Areas for further research are highlighted along with a discussion of the implications of these findings for practitioners.

Judicial Dispositions of Ex-Parte and Domestic Violence Protection Order Hearings: A Comparative Analysis of Victim Requests and Court Authorized Relief

Author: Yearwood, Douglas L11 North Carolina Governor's Crime Commission, Criminal Justice Analysis Center, Raleigh, NC www.gcc.state.nc.us

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61510307?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper presents findings from a study on judicial dispositions of ex-parte orders & domestic violence protection order hearings. Findings are presented with an emphasis on delineating the types of relief which are requested by victims of domestic violence in relation to the types of relief which the courts grant. Results indicate that disparity exists between what types of relief victims request & the types of relief which are awarded by the courts. Research questions are analyzed in order to further define these discrepancies with diverse policy implications & further research issues being recommended as a result of these analyses. 3 Tables, 17 References.

Abstract: The nationwide growth in specialized or problem-solving courts, including drug courts, community courts, mental health courts, & domestic violence courts, among others, raises questions about the role of the state with respect to social change. According to social control theories of the state, especially theories of technocratic or rationalized Justice, law is increasingly about efficiency, speed, & effectiveness. Specialized courts, however, take on a social problem approach to crime, seeking to address crime's "root causes" within the individual, the society, & the larger culture in ways more characteristic of social movements. Are specialized courts about social control or social change? This study examines state action in a specialized court in domestic violence in order to examine this question. I focus on a domestic violence court that arose in February 1997 & four years later employed full-time judges. prosecuting & defense attorneys, & numerous other staff to handle all misdemeanor domestic violence cases in Salt Lake County, Utah. I ask how legal, political, & community officials justify the court & its operation in order to examine some important issues about the role of the state & social change. Ultimately, I suggest that my findings about the complementary roles of social control & social change within domestic violence courts have implications not only for critical theories of technocratic justice & for the battered women's movement but also for democratic theories of the state. 103 References.

Understanding Gender and Intimate Partner Abuse

Author: McHugh, Maureen C11 Dept Psychology, Indiana U, PA mcmchugh@uip.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60091829?accountid=14925

Abstract: This issue represents our efforts to apply a feminist or gender lens to the research on violence in intimate relationships & to forward our understanding of gender & interpersonal violence. The paper introduces the articles in this special issue on "Understanding Gender & Intimate Partner Violence" within a framework of theoretical & methodological issues in feminist research. The current articles are viewed as contributing to our understanding of gender & interpersonal violence: by investigating patterns of interpersonal violence; by examining interpersonal violence with the context of lifespan & culture; by positing or testing theoretical models for gender & interpersonal violence; & by arguing for methodological or conceptual advances in the field. 53 References.

Coercion in Intimate Partner Violence: Toward a New Conceptualization

Author: Dutton, Mary Ann1; Goodman, Lisa A1 Dept Psychiatry, Georgetown U Medical Center, Washington, DC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60110090?accountid=14925

Abstract: For decades, battered women's advocates have placed coercive control squarely at the center of their analysis of intimate partner violence. Yet, little work has been done to conceptualize & measure the key construct of coercive control. In this article, we apply French & Raven's social power model to a conceptualization of coercive control in intimate partner violence relationships. Central elements of the model include: social ecology; setting the stage; coercion involving a demand & a credible threat for noncompliance; surveillance; delivery of threatened consequences; & the victim's behavioral & emotional response to coercion. These elements occur in spiraling & overlapping sequences to establish an overall situation of coercive control. The implications of this model for theory & practice are discussed. 1 Figure, 64 References. Adapted from the source document.

Treating Perpetrators of Domestic Violence: Gender Differences in the Applicability of the Theory of Planned Behavior

Author: Kernsmith, Poco11 School Social Work, Wayne State U, Detroit, MI poco@wayne.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60099823?accountid=14925

Abstract: Female perpetrated intimate partner violence has commonly been treated, both legally & clinically, similarly to male perpetrated violence. However, there is little empirical research of the gender differences in treatment needs or the applicability of classic models of batterer intervention for women. This study examines the applicability of one theory that has commonly been used to guide treatment of male perpetrators, the theory of planned behavior. R. M. Tolman, J. L. Edleson, & M. Fendrich (1996) found the components of this theory to be moderately predictive of abusive behavior among males. In a survey of 114 male & female participants in batterer intervention counseling in Los Angeles County, the current study confirmed that the model predicted male behaviors but found the model did not apply to female violent behavior. 6 Tables, 52 References.

An Adult Attachment Theoretical Perspective of Gender Symmetry in Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Gormley, Barbara11 School Education, U Miami, Coral Gables, FL b.gormley@miami.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60110116?accountid=14925

Abstract: Adult attachment theory & research specifically related to men's & women's intimate partner violence (IPV) are reviewed. In an effort to help explain gender similarities, two different IPV patterns predicted by individual differences in adult attachment orientations are proposed. Gender differences are addressed, including by critiquing the assessment of outcome severity in previous research. Applications to practice & recommendations for future research are discussed. 80 References. Adapted from the source document.

Understanding Gender and Intimate Partner Violence from an International Perspective

Author: Krahe, Barbara1; Bieneck, Steffen; Moller, Ingrid1 Dept Psychology, U Potsdam, Germany krahe@rz.uni-potsdam.de

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60110169?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper reviews the international literature on intimate partner violence with a focus on gender differences in perpetration & victimization rates. A total of 35 studies from 21 countries are discussed that report prevalence or incidence rates of men's & women's involvement in physical &/or sexual aggression against an intimate partner. In addition, evidence on risk factors as well as consequences of intimate partner violence for men & women is presented. Conceptual & methodological differences between the studies & the lack of comparable databases within countries are discussed as limitations of the evidence, & perspectives for future research are outlined in the framework of cross-cultural psychology. 4 Tables, 71 References. Adapted from the source document.

Theorizing Gender in Intimate Partner Violence Research

Author: Anderson, Kristin L11 Dept Sociology, Western Washington U, Bellingham Kristin.Anderson@wwu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60091856?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research findings of sex-symmetry in the perpetration of intimate partner assaults have sparked vigorous debate about the appropriate definition & measurement of intimate violence. A neglected but central issue in this debate is the conceptualization & measurement of gender. This article first examines the often unstated theoretical perspective on gender that underlies the research on sex-symmetry in intimate partner violence. This perspective treats gender as an individual characteristic of persons. Next, I describe challenges to the individualist model of gender from two emerging theoretical perspectives -- interactionist & structuralist gender theories. The article concludes with suggestions for research on intimate partner violence that are informed by these new gender theories. 65 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Interaction of Country of Origin, Acculturation, and Gender Role Ideology on Wife Abuse

Author: Harris, Richard J1; Firestone, Juanita M; Vega, William A1 The University of Texas, San Antonio, Richard.Harris@utsa.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/807903965?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: Using data from the Mexican American Prevalence and Services Survey (), this research tests whether the impact of acculturation and gender role ideology on wife abuse depends on country of origin. Methods: Two separate logistic regressions, one for U.S.-born Latinas and one for Mexican-born Latinas, are compared to test the impact of the interaction of place of origin with the other variables. Results: Our findings support earlier research indicating that power dynamics within a relationship impact the likelihood of a wife reporting she has experienced abuse. Significant differences in the influence of independent variables are found when comparing U.S.- and Mexican-born respondents. In particular, variables related to family power dynamics operate differently. Gender role beliefs, however, have an independent influence for both groups after controlling for sociodemographic factors and power dynamics. Women with more traditional orientations are less likely to report abuse. Conclusions: Because the impact of gender role ideology is significant and in the same direction for both those born in the United States and those born in Mexico, it is unlikely that the traditional familism and gender role orientations reported among the Mexican born afford them greater protection against abuse.

Gender role beliefs, however, have an independent influence for both groups after controlling for sociodemographic factors & power dynamics. Women with more traditional orientations are less likely to report abuse. Conclusions. Because the impact of gender role ideology is significant & in the same direction for both those born in the United States & those born in Mexico, it is unlikely that the traditional familism & gender role orientations reported among the Mexican born afford them greater protection against abuse. 2 Tables, 72 References.

How Do Changes in Welfare Law Affect Domestic Violence? An Analysis of Connecticut Towns, 1990-2000

Author: Nou, Jennifer1; Timmins, Christopher1 Nuffield Coll, Oxford U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61372174?accountid=14925

Abstract: The 1996 Personal Responsibility & Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act transformed welfare from an ongoing cash assistance program by restricting participation through time limits & emphasizing rapid entrance into the labor force. Changes in welfare dependency induced by these legal reforms had the potential to impact rates of domestic violence. Using decennial census, welfare caseload, & police report data, this paper investigates the introduction of time limits & work mandates across Connecticut towns. For a variety of reasons, Connecticut proves to be an ideal laboratory from which to obtain evidence. We find that rates of domestic violence fell in Connecticut with the passage of the new welfare law, especially in towns most subject to the law's provisions. Using Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Report data, we also find evidence that such results hold independent of the reform's effects on other personal crimes & crimes in general.

Training Police Officers on Domestic Violence and Racism

Author: Huisman, Kimberly1; Martinez, Jeri; Wilson, Cathleen1 U Maine

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61371998?accountid=14925

Abstract: Teaching about domestic violence & racism is a formidable task that requires the inclusion of material that challenges dominant ideologies about race & gender. A recent training for police officers about domestic violence & racism serves as a good example of how challenging the task can be. Drawing from this 1-day police training, from existing pedagogical literature, & from the authors' collective experiences teaching about these issues, the authors address challenges encountered & propose strategies to mitigate them. The authors propose a multilevel approach to implementing strategies to address these challenges, which includes ongoing involvement during three stages of the training. References.

Female-Perpetrated Intimate Partner Violence and Romantic Attachment Style in a College Student Sample

Author: Orcutt, Holly K1; Garcia, Marilyn; Pickett, Scott M1 Dept Psychology, Northern Illinois U, DeKalb horcutt@niu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61295048?accountid=14925

Abstract: The frequency, severity, & reciprocity of female-perpetrated intimate partner violence & its consequences (i.e., injuries) were investigated in a college sample of women (N = 457). Participants were classified into one of the following four groups on the basis of self reported physical assault perpetration & victimization against their relationship partners: nonviolent, perpetrator-only, victim-only, & bi-directionally violent. Results showed that females in the bi-directionally violent group had a reportedly higher occurrence (although not always statistically significant) of perpetration & victimization than those in the perpetrator-only & victim-only groups. Additionally, a similar degree of reciprocity was indicated by females in bi-directionally violent relationships in terms of violence severity & the occurrence of injury. Adult romantic attachment style was also examined among a subset of females (N = 328), & bi-directionally violent females were found to have the highest reported levels of attachment anxiety. Further, females high in attachment anxiety & low in attachment avoidance were more likely to report perpetrating violence than females high in both styles. Implications for prevention are discussed.

Typology of Reactions to Intimate Partner Violence among Men and Women Arrested for Partner Violence

Author: Hamberger, L Kevin1; Guse, Clare1 Racine Family Practice Center, WI

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60049358?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined behavioral & emotional responses to partner-initiated violence reported by men & women court-ordered to domestic violence counseling. Respondents provided Likert-type ratings of behavioral & emotional responses to their partners' initiated violence. Cluster analysis to determine heterogeneity of emotional & behavioral responses resulted in a three-cluster solution. The profile for Cluster 1, predominantly male, showed no specific behavioral or emotional reaction pattern. Cluster 2 respondents, evenly split between males & females, but comprising a high proportion of all of the female participants, reported frequently doing what the partner wanted & attempting to escape. Emotional responses experienced by Cluster 2 respondents were anger, insult, & fear. Cluster 3, predominantly male, reported a frequent tendency to use force in response & escape when their partners initiated physical violence. Emotionally, Cluster 3 participants reported experiencing high levels of anger & insult, & relatively low levels of fear & low levels of amusement. Implications of these findings for development of gender based intervention strategies will be discussed. Tables, Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

Prosecution of Women Arrested for Intimate Partner Abuse

Author: Henning, Kris1; Renauer, Brian1 Administration Justice, Portland State U, OR khenning@pdx.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60057229?accountid=14925

Abstract: Increasing arrests of women for domestic violence (DV) in the wake of mandatory arrest laws have generated significant concern among victim advocates, researchers, & practitioners. It is commonly believed that many, if not most, of the women arrested are victims who were acting in self-defense. Understanding how these cases are handled by prosecutors & judges is important if we wish to minimize the negative consequences of these errant arrests. The present study examines factors prosecutors in a large southern city considered when accepting or rejecting DV cases involving female defendants. The results indicate that almost one half (47%) of the cases involving women arrested for DV against a heterosexual intimate partner were rejected by prosecutors; another 16% were dismissed by a judge. Legal factors like a defendant's prior criminal arrests, use of a weapon, victim injury, &, most important, the type of arrest (i.e., dual vs. single arrest) all affected prosecutors' decisions to take these cases. Female defendants arrested for offending against a male intimate partner were treated more leniently than male defendants & women arrested for domestic offenses involving other types of relationships (i.e., familial, homosexual). The results highlight the need for a further study of officers' arrest decisions in cases involving heterosexual intimate partners. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Psychosocial Correlates of Dating Violence Victimization among Latino Youth

Author: Howard, Donna E1; Beck, Kenneth; Kerr, Melissa Hallmark; Shattuck, Teresa1 Dept Public & Community Health, U Maryland, College Park dhowardI@umail.end.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60104500?accountid=14925

Abstract: To examine the association between physical dating violence victimization & risk & protective factors, an anonymous, cross-sectional, self-reported survey was administered to Latino youth (n = 446) residing in suburban Washington, DC. Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed, & adjusted OR & 95% CI were examined. Approximately 9% of Latino adolescents reported physical dating violence victimization. Overall, youth who reported carrying a gun, involvement in physical fights & suicidal thoughts were at greater odds of reporting dating violence. Among females, fighting was the sole risk behavior associated with dating violence. Girls who reported a stronger sense of self were less likely to report dating violence. Among males, gun carrying, but not physical fighting, & having considered suicide were associated with dating violence. Spending time each week with a mentor was also positively associated with male dating violence victimization. Dating violence appeared to cluster with other risk behavior engagement. Important gender differences in associated risk & protective behaviors were identified & should be incorporated into primary & secondary prevention activities. 3 Tables, 36 References.

Addressing Intimate Partner Violence in Substance-Abuse Treatment

Author: Fals-Stewart, William1; Kennedy, Cheryl1 Research Triangle Instit, RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61381220?accountid=14925

Abstract: As the use of partner-involved therapies for alcoholism & drug abuse become more common in substance-abuse treatment programs, providers are more frequently encountering one of the most challenging & politically charged public health issues of our time: intimate partner violence (IPV). Recent investigations reveal 40-60% of married or cohabiting substance-abusing patients report episodes of partner aggression in the year preceding entry into treatment. In this article, the interrelationship between substance use & IPV is examined, with an emphasis on clinical implications & options for substance-abuse treatment providers who are often called upon to address IPV during the course of working with their patients. We also describe different intervention options for IPV, offer recommendations for substance-abuse treatment providers who work with partner-violent couples, & outline future research directions.

HIV and Intimate Partner Violence among Methadone-Maintained Women in New York City

Author: El-Bassel, Nabila1; Gilbert, Louisa; Wu, Elwin; Go, Hyun; Hill, Jennifer1 Social Intervention Group, Columbia U School Social Work, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61367289?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been recognized as a risk factor for HIV & sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among women, particularly among those who are drug involved. This study examines the temporal relationships between sexual &/or physical partner violence (IPV) & sexual risk of HIV/STI transmission in a longitudinal study with a random sample of 416 women enrolled in methadone maintenance treatment programs in New York City. Two hypotheses are tested: whether sexual risk-related factors or risk reduction behavior leads to subsequent IPV (H1); & whether IPV decreases likelihood of subsequent risk reduction behavior (i.e., requesting to use condoms) or increases likelihood of certain sexual risk-related factors (i.e., inconsistent condom use, having unprotected anal sex, having more than one partner, exchanging sex for drugs or money, having had an STI, being HIV positive, having a partner who engaged in HIV risk) (H2). Participants were interviewed at three waves: baseline, six months & twelve months. Hypotheses were examined using propensity score matching & multiple logistic regression analyses. The prevalence rate of any physical or sexual IPV was 46% at baseline. Findings for H1 indicate that women who reported always using condoms at wave 2 were significantly less likely than women who reported inconsistent or no condom use to experience subsequent IPV at wave 3. Similarly, increased risk of IPV at wave 3 was associated with self-reported STIs (OR=2.0, p=.03), & unprotected anal sex (OR= 2.0, p<.01); always requesting that partners use condoms was associated with a significant decrease in subsequent IPV (OR=.18, p<.01). Findings for H2 suggest that IPV at wave 2 decreased the subsequent likelihood of always using condoms at wave 3 (OR=.41, p<.01) & always requesting that a partner use condoms (OR=.42, p=.02). The implications of the findings for HIV prevention interventions for women on methadone are discussed. Tables, Figures, References. [Copyright 2005 Elsevier Ltd.]

Women's Experience of Intimate Partner Violence in Haiti

Author: Gage, Anastasia J11 Dept International Health & Development, Tulane U, New Orleans, LA agage@tulane.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59986282?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined individual, partner, & community characteristics associated with the occurrence of intimate partner violence among ever-married women of reproductive age, using data from the 2000 Haiti Demographic & Health Survey. Separate logistic regressions were analyzed to assess women's risks of experiencing emotional, physical & sexual violence & multiple forms of intimate partner violence in the past 12 months. Twenty-nine percent of women in the sample experienced some form of intimate partner violence in the past 12 months, with 13 percent having experienced at least two different forms of violence. Significant positive associations with all forms of violence were found for lack of completion of primary school, history of violence exposure in women's families of origin either through witnessing violence between parents while growing up or direct experience of physical violence perpetrated by family members, partner's jealousy, partner's need for control, partner's history of drunkenness, & female-dominated financial decision-making. Significant positive associations were found between men's physical abuse of children at the community level & women's risk of experiencing emotional & physical violence. Neighborhood poverty & male unemployment, number of children living at home, women's attitudinal acceptance of wife beating, & male-dominated financial decision-making were additional risk factors for sexual violence. Women's economic independence was a protective factor for emotional & physical violence, while relationship quality was protective for all forms of violence & multiple victimizations.

Does Pregnancy Provide Immunity from Intimate Partner Abuse among Hong Kong Chinese Women?

Author: Lau, Ying11 U Hong Kong, North Point, Hong Kong h9770024@hkusua.hku.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60027130?accountid=14925

Abstract: The level of intimate partner abuse that occurs in Hong Kong Chinese families & the type, nature, & severity of abuse are primary concerns of those who are engaged in efforts to reduce & control abuse. A total of 1200 postnatal women were recruited at a university-affiliated regional public hospital to participate in a study with a retrospective explorative comparative design. The women were identified as abused or non-abused using the Abuse Assessment Screen Questionnaire (AAS). The type, nature, & profile of intimate partner abuse were investigated by using the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS-2). The vulnerable factors & predictors of abuse during pregnancy were explored in their demographic, psycho-socio-economic-cultural, & obstetric aspects. Analysis of the data indicated that 134 (11.2%) of the women had experienced abuse during pregnancy. The majority of this abuse took the form of psychological aggression (79.1%), & nearly half (49.3%) of the abused women had experienced sexual abuse. The husband was the perpetrator in the majority of cases (82.1%). Women who were younger, born in Hong Kong, single or cohabiting, had poor socio-economic status, a poor partner relationship, & an unplanned pregnancy were more likely to be abused based on multiple logistic regression models of various nature & type of abuse (p<0.05). The findings provide fundamental information for the prevention of intimate partner abuse among the Hong Kong population. The implications, limitations, & future research are discussed.

Attachment and Family Violence: Complexities in Knowing

Author: Bolen, Rebecca M11 Coll Social Work, U Tennessee, Knoxville

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389895?accountid=14925

Abstract: After briefly surveying previous research on attachment among children in both abusive & nonabusive families, methodological complexities involved in the measurement of attachment are noted. A study by K. J. Sternberg et al (2005) that measured attachment indirectly using self-reports to capture individual perceptions of attachment among Israeli adolescents in families with histories of domestic violence is cited as "methodologically rigorous" as well as illustrative of the difficulties of such research. Sternberg & et al's findings -- particularly that witnessing domestic violence was not adversely related to adolescents' perceived attachment to their parents -- should be viewed with caution until they can be replicated & the attachment measures validated. Nonetheless, these findings offer hope that adolescents' attachments to parents can serve as buffers against the effects of witnessing family violence; implications for intervention are also discussed.

Adolescents' Perceptions of Attachment to Their Mothers and Fathers in Families with Histories of Domestic Violence: A Longitudinal Perspective

Author: Sternberg, Kathleen J1; Lamb, Michael E; Guterman, Eva; Abbott, Craig B; Dawud-Noursi, Samia1 c/o Lamb -- Dept Social & Development Psychology, Cambridge U, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59984403?accountid=14925

Abstract: Effects of both childhood & teenage experiences of domestic violence on adolescent-parent attachments were examined. Israeli adolescents (M = 15.9 years) who were either victims of physical abuse, witnesses of physical spouse abuse, victims & witnesses of abuse, or neither victims nor witnesses of abuse were questioned about attachments to their parents using the Inventory of Parent & Peer Attachment [IPPA; Armsden, G. C., & Greenberg, M. T. (1987). The inventory of parent & peer attachment: Individual differences & their relationship to psychological well-being in adolescence. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 16, 427-454]. Abuse status 5 years earlier was unrelated to the adolescents' current perceptions of their attachments whereas current abuse status predicted the adolescents' perceptions of attachment to their mothers. Adolescents who were victims of physical abuse reported weaker attachments to their parents than adolescents who were not abused or who had solely witnessed interparental physical abuse. Attachments to mothers were weaker whether or not mothers were the perpetrators of abuse. These findings suggest that victimization adversely affects children's perceptions of relationships with their parents, but that changes in the exposure to family violence are associated with changes in relationships with parents. These findings suggest that intervention can have positive effects on parent-child relationships despite violent histories. Tables, References. [Copyright 2005 Elsevier Ltd.]

Gender, Traditionalism, and Attitudes Toward Domestic Violence Within a Closed Community

Author: Shoham, Efrat11 Department Ashkelon, Academic College and Kibbutz Netzer Sereni, 70395 Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810631841?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research was aimed at examining the attitudes toward domestic violence of people living in communal secular and religious kibbutzim. The findings, disregarding gender or traditionalism, indicate that most of the kibbutz members examined view the kibbutz as almost totally lacking any problem of violence toward women by their partners. The belief that the kibbutz home is a secure place for women within the family framework appears, surprisingly, at a higher frequency among women than among men. There are two possible theoretical explanations for this finding. First, the kibbutz lifestyle has indeed brought about equal power relationships, which explains why domestic violence is not viewed as a social problem, mostly by secular women. Second, women, who play a relatively minor role in constructing the public agenda in the kibbutz, have not become aware of the existence of this issue in the closed community.

Understanding Domestic Violence Resource Utilization and Survivor Solutions among Immigrant and Refugee Women: Introduction to the Special Issue

Author: Bhuyan, Rupaleem1; Senturia, Kirsten1 U Washington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60488041?accountid=14925

Abstract: Opens this special journal issue by reviewing the unique problems posed by domestic violence for immigrant & refugee women in the US. Contributions offer new insights generated by community-based participatory action research in 9 different cultural/ethnic communities in the Seattle, WA, area: African American; American Indian/Alaskan Native; Ethiopian; Cambodian; Filipina; Latina; lesbian/bisexual/transgender; Russian-speaking; & Vietnamese. Results add to knowledge gained from previous research on how both structural factors -- financial resources, social support, knowledge of rights, & availability of culturally competent helping sources -- & cultural factors -- language barriers; beliefs about women's status, roles, & rights; religious beliefs; & attitudes toward seeking help from outsiders -- affect a woman's response to domestic abuse. Recommendations are offered for helping immigrant & refugee women with this problem at the systems, service, & community levels. 13 References. K. Hyatt Stewart

"Women Must Endure according to Their Karma": Cambodian Immigrant Women Talk about Domestic Violence

Author: Bhuyan, Rupaleem1; Mell, Molly; Senturia, Kirsten; Sullivan, Marianne; Shiu-Thornton, Sharyne1 U Washington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61550305?accountid=14925

Abstract: Asian populations living in the United States share similar cultural values that influence their experiences with domestic violence. However, it is critical to recognize how differential cultural beliefs in the context of immigration & adjustment to life in the United States affect attitudes, interpretations, & response to domestic violence. This article discusses findings from community-based participatory action research that explores how Cambodian immigrant women talk about domestic violence, what forms of abuse contribute to domestic violence, & what strategies they use to cope with & respond to abuse in their lives. The richness of this research lies in the stories that immigrant women tell about their struggle & their strength in addressing domestic violence. 25 References.

Abstract: This article discusses the experiences of domestic violence among Ethiopian refugees & immigrants in the United States. A subset (n = 18) of the larger study sample (N = 254) participated in three focus groups with Amharic-speaking survivors of domestic violence who were currently in or had left abusive relationships. The research was conducted through a public health department, University, & community agency partnership. Findings show domestic violence as taking place within a context of immigration, acculturation, & rapid changes in family & social structure. Participants expressed a need for language & culture-specific domestic violence support & advocacy as well as education programs regarding U.S. laws & resources. 23 References.

"No Way Out": Russian-Speaking Women's Experiences with Domestic Violence

Author: Crandall, Marie1; Senturia, Kirsten; Sullivan, Marianne; Shiu-Thornton, Sharyne1 Dept Surgery, Northwestern U, Chicago, IL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60493477?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores the experience of domestic violence & utilization of domestic violence resources among immigrant women who were Russian speaking. Participants, many of whom came to the United States as so-called mail-order brides, reported diverse forms of abuse, including isolation & financial restrictions, & were reluctant to get outside help because of embarrassment about their circumstances. Survivors stressed the importance of language- & culture-appropriate outreach & services & urged that women receive information about domestic violence services & laws on immigration. Assistance with housing, child care, & job searches is integral to safe transitions out of abusive relationships. 24 References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2005.]

"Like a Bird in a Cage": Vietnamese Women Survivors Talk about Domestic Violence

Author: Shiu-Thornton, Sharyne1; Senturia, Kirsten; Sullivan, Marianne1 Dept Health Services, U Washington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60503889?accountid=14925

Abstract: In recent years, a growing literature has emerged that explores the role of culture in domestic violence for ethnic minority populations, including immigrants & refugees. This article presents qualitative data collected from Vietnamese refugee women through a research project in partnership with the Refugee Women's Alliance in Seattle, Washington. Through the women's stories, their own self-awareness of domestic violence as Vietnamese women residing in the United States is available for reflection & review. Issues of acculturation, changing gender roles, examples of strength, & cultural persistence constitute the thematic structure within which these women articulate their needs for creating & sustaining a life free of abuse for themselves & their children. 20 References.

Participatory Action Research in Practice: A Case Study in Addressing Domestic Violence in Nine Cultural Communities

Author: Sullivan, Marianne1; Bhuyan, Rupaleem; Senturia, Kirsten; Shiu-Thornton, Sharyne; Ciske, Sandy1 Dept Sociomedical Sciences, Mailman School Public Health, Columbia U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60497436?accountid=14925

Abstract: Participatory action research (PAR) is increasingly recognized as a viable approach to developing relationships with communities & working closely with them to address complex public health problems. In the case of domestic violence research, where ensuring the safety of women participants who are battered is paramount, participatory approaches to research that include advocates & women who are battered in research design, implementation, analysis, & dissemination are critical to successful & mutually beneficial projects. This article presents a case study of a PAR project that conducted formative qualitative research on domestic violence in nine ethnic & sexual minority communities. The article describes the specific ways in which a PAR approach was operationalized & discusses in detail how community participation shaped various stages of the research. Furthermore, specific actions that resulted from the research project are reported. 20 References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2005.]

Services and Intimate Partner Violence in the United States: A County-Level Analysis

Author: Tiefenthaler, Jill1; Farmer, Amy; Sambira, Amandine1 Dept Economics, Colgate U, Hamilton, NY tiefenthaler@mai.colgate.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60547435?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite the prevalence of intimate partner violence & its social costs, we show that many counties lack services to help victims & that community resources play a significant role in determining the likelihood of service provision. Because resources are often generated at the local level & state & federal funding usually require a grant proposal, services for victims of intimate partner violence are more likely to be available in well-resourced areas with a major college or university in the county. Analysis of the changes in the provision of services since the Violence Against Women Act was introduced suggests that funding needs to be specifically targeted to underserved areas. 4 Tables, 49 References.

Resources, Family Organization, and Domestic Violence Against Married Women in Minya, Egypt

Author: Yount, Kathryn M11 Dept Global Health & Sociology, Emory U, Atlanta, GA kyount@sph.emory.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60489825?accountid=14925

Abstract: I evaluate the influence of household wealth, women's socioeconomic dependence, status inconsistency, & family organization on physical abuse in the prior year & attitudes about wife abuse & divorce among 2,522 married women in Minya, Egypt. Household wealth is negatively associated with physical abuse. Women who are dependent on marriage because they have sons & less schooling than their husbands are more likely to have experienced physical abuse & to report marginally more tolerance for such abuse. Women who are isolated from natal or biological kin & living with marital relatives are more likely to have experienced physical abuse. Findings underscore the role of women's dependence & social isolation in enabling physical abuse among women of all economic classes. 3 Tables, 2 Figures, 63 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Reporting of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault by Nonstrangers to the Police

Author: Felson, Richard B1; Pare, Paul-Philippe1 Dept Sociology, Pennsylvania State U, University Park

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60494224?accountid=14925

Abstract: We examine the effects of the gender of the victim & offender & their relationship to each other on whether sexual & physical assaults are reported to the police. We also examine the reasons victims give for not reporting assaults & whether reporting patterns have changed over time. The analyses are based on a sample of 6,291 physical assaults & 1,787 sexual assaults from the National Violence Against Women Survey. The results suggest that victims are just as likely to report domestic assaults as they are to report assaults by other people they know. Male victims are particularly reluctant to report assaults by their intimate partners, whereas third parties are particularly unlikely to report assaults by partners of either gender. Sexual assaults, particularly those that involve acquaintances, are less likely to be reported. These patterns have not changed since the 1960s. 3 Tables, 2 Figures, 47 References.

The Interactive Construction of Narrative Styles in Sensitive Interviews: The Case of Domestic Violence Research

Author: Enosh, Guy1; Buchbinder, Eli1 School Social Work, U Haifa, Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60011974?accountid=14925

Abstract: Awareness of the possible power relations & conflicts between interviewer & interviewee in qualitative research has grown in recent years; however, scant attempts have been made to analyze this phenomenon empirically. The current work uses interviews conducted with battered women & batterers to understand the co-construction of the narrative of domestic violence. The emergent narrative style is shown to be the product of the interaction between interviewer & interviewee. Four different narrative styles are identified: the narrative style (a) as a struggle, (b) as deflection, (c) as negotiation, & (d) as a self-observation process. The divergent goals & agendas of interviewers & interviewees are discussed, as well as the replication of relational patterns of the interviewee in the interview process. Emphasized are the implications for the study of sensitive domains & power relations in qualitative research. Tables, Figures, References.

Children in the Crossfire: Child Custody Determinations among Couples with a History of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Kernic, Mary A1; Monary-Ernsdorff, Daphne J; Koepsell, Jennifer K; Holt, Victoria L1 U Washington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60015282?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although most states mandate considerations of intimate partner violence (IPV) in child custody proceedings, little is known about how often a preexisting history of IPV is effectively presented to the courts in dissolution cases &, when it is, what effect it has on child custody & visitation outcomes. This retrospective cohort study examined the effects of a history of IPV, further categorized by whether substantiation of that history existed & whether the court handling the custody proceedings knew of that history, on child custody & visitation outcomes. The findings from this study highlight several issues of concern regarding the reality of child custody among families with a history of IPV. These include two primary concerns: a lack of identification of IPV even among cases with a documented, substantiated history, & a lack of strong protections being ordered even among cases in which a history of substantiated IPV is known to exist.

Child Custody Mediation in Cases of Domestic Violence: Empirical Evidence of a Failure to Protect

Author: Johnson, Nancy E1; Saccuzzo, Dennis P; Koen, Wendy J1 c/o Saccuzzo -- San Diego State U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60007237?accountid=14925

Abstract: Mediation of child custody disputes is mandated in several states. Investigators have averred that victims of domestic violence (DV) are greatly disadvantaged in mediation. The present study empirically evaluated outcomes & found that mediators failed to recognize & report DV in 56.9% of the DV cases. The court's screening form failed to indicate DV in at least 14.7% of the violent cases. Mediation resulted in poor outcomes for DV victims in terms of protections, such as supervised visitation & protected child exchanges. Mediator capacity to focus on the child's best interest was called into question. Child custody mediation should not be mandated in cases of DV. Tables, Figures, References.

Unidirectional and Bidirectional Intimate Partner Violence among White, Black, and Hispanic Couples in the United States

Author: Caetano, Raul1; Ramisetty-Mikler, Suhasini; Field, Craig A1 School Public Health, U Texas Houston, Dallas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60045686?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes the rates & risk factors of unidirectional & bidirectional intimate partner violence (IPV) among White, Black & Hispanic couples in the US. Subjects constitute a multistage area probability sample representative of married & cohabiting couples from the 48 contiguous United States. Results indicate that most couples reporting violence engage in bidirectional IPV. Blacks are more likely than Whites to report bidirectional IPV. In addition, severe unidirectional & bidirectional IPV are more common among Blacks & Hispanics. The results also indicate that predictors of IPV vary depending on whether it is unidirectional or bidirectional. Unidirectional female-to-male IPV & bidirectional IPV are more associated with the characteristics of the female. In contrast, the occurrence of unidirectional male-to-female IPV is associated with a single risk factor, male childhood physical abuse. These findings highlight the importance of distinguishing different types of IPV & have important epidemiological & prevention implications. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

The Response of Christian Clergy to Domestic Violence: Help or Hindrance?

Author: Shannon-Lewy, Colleen1; Dull, Valerie T1 Dept Psychiatry, Oregon Health & Science U, Portland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61703291?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper reviews the literature regarding Christian clergy as a resource for victims of domestic violence, a common threat to women. Although assistance is available, there are more victims than resources, resulting in many women having limited to no help at all. One resource for victims is the clergy, who are often perceived as respected members of the community & have the authority to make suggestions or even interventions about family issues. However, the literature suggests that cleric theological beliefs may hinder their ability to counsel victims, & the effectiveness of cleric ability to counsel victims varies greatly. Future directions for research are suggested in order to understand what factors influence cleric attitudes & counseling abilities. References. [Copyright 2005 Elsevier Ltd.]

Arrest and Intimate Partner Violence: Toward a More Complete Application of Deterrence Theory

Author: Williams, Kirk R11 Dept Sociology & Robert Presley Center Crime & Justice Studies, U California, Riverside Kirk.Williams@UCR.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61684371?accountid=14925

Abstract: Two decades of research have failed to produce consistent & compelling results that arrest deters intimate partner violence. This tradition of research is reviewed, concluding that little can be learned about the deterrent efficacy of arrest (or other sanctions) for this type of violence until a more complete framework of deterrence theory is specified to guide further research. The framework should delineate mediating influences besides deterrence, linking arrest to the prevention, reduction, or cessation of intimate partner violence, & factors that moderate those influences. Such factors bear on the differential sensitivity to sanctions on the part of actual or potential perpetrators of intimate partner violence. Recommendations for future research are offered, including suggestions for data needed to draw defensible causal inferences about these mediating & moderating influences. Figures, References.

The Gender Paradigm in Domestic Violence Research and Theory: Part 1 -- The Conflict of Theory and Data

Author: Dutton, Donald G1; Nicholls, Tonia L1 Dept Psychology, U British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C dondutton@shaw.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61706356?accountid=14925

Abstract: Feminist theory of intimate violence is critically reviewed in the light of data from numerous incidence studies reporting levels of violence by female perpetrators higher than those reported for males, particularly in younger age samples. A critical analysis of the methodology of these studies is made with particular reference to the Conflict Tactics Scale developed & utilised by Straus & his colleagues. Results show that the gender disparity in injuries from domestic violence is less than originally portrayed by feminist theory. Studies are also reviewed indicating high levels of unilateral intimate violence by females to both males & females. Males appear to report their own victimization less than females do & to not view female violence against them as a crime. Hence, they differentially under-report being victimized by partners on crime victim surveys. It is concluded that feminist theory is contradicted by these findings & that the call for "qualitative" studies by feminists is really a means of avoiding this conclusion. A case is made for a paradigm having developed amongst family violence activists & researchers that precludes the notion of female violence, trivializes injuries to males & maintains a monolithic view of a complex social problem.

The Future of Research on Intimate Partner Violence: Person-Oriented and Variable-Oriented Perspectives

Author: Bogat, G Anne1; Levendosky, Alytia A; Von Eye, Alexander1 Dept Psychology, Michigan State U, East Lansing bogat@msu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368089?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article uses the distinction between the person & the variable orientations as a frame for structuring (1) research on IPV, (2) results of this research, & (3) an agenda for future research. The main tenet of this agenda is that causes, processes, & effects of IPV are person & context specific; therefore, results that relate variables to each other are of limited value if it can be shown that the processes that take place, the meaning of the variables, the profile of the transgressors & the women who experience IPV depend on time, environment, & research design. Examples of valuable variable-oriented research are given; examples of the growing contribution made by person-oriented research are given as well. Sample theories are sketched out, for the variable-oriented, the person-oriented, & the theoretical research arenas, the need for future research is derived from inconsistencies & shortcomings in both current research & theory. Sample research questions are proposed. The contributions made by the authors of this Special Section are embedded within the discussion of research & theory of IPV. It is shown that each of the contributions is valuable within a particular segment of the research landscape. Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

A Theoretical Framework for Understanding Help-Seeking Processes among Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Liang, Belle1; Goodman, Lisa; Tummala-Narra, Pratyusha; Weintraub, Sarah1 Dept Counseling & Developmental Psychology, Lynch School Education, Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA liangbe@bc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61354207?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper suggests a conceptual framework for understanding the processes of help-seeking among survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV). A cognitive theory from general literature on help-seeking in "stigmatizing" situations suggests three relevant processes or stages of seeking help in the IPV context: defining the problem, deciding to seek help, & selecting a source of support. Individual, interpersonal, & sociocultural factors that influence decision-making at each of these stages are discussed & illustrated with case examples. Figures, References.

Protective Factors against Suicide Attempt Risk among African American Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Meadows, Lindi A1; Kaslow, Nadine J; Thompson, Martie P; Jurkovic, Gregory J1 c/o Kaslow -- Emory Dept Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Grady Health System, Emory U School Medicine, Atlanta, GA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397118?accountid=14925

Abstract: Protective factors (hope, spirituality, self-efficacy, coping, social support-family, social support-friends, & effectiveness of obtaining resources) against suicide attempts were examined in economically, educationally, & socially disadvantaged African American women (100 suicide attempters, 100 nonattempters) who had experienced recent intimate partner violence. Significant positive associations were found between all possible pairs of protective factors. Bivariate logistic regressions revealed that higher scores on each of the seven protective factors predicted nonattempter status; multivariate logistic regressions indicated that higher scores on measures of hope or social support-family showed unique predictive value for nonattempter status. Further, the multivariate model accurately predicted suicide attempt status 69.5% of the time.

The Influence of Community Violence on the Functioning of Women Experiencing Domestic Violence

Abstract: The relationships among women's experiences of domestic violence, community violence, & their mental health functioning were explored (N = 94). Social contagion theory was used to argue for the link between community violence & family violence. Results revealed that women's experiences of domestic violence were not related to community violence. Furthermore, women's mental health functioning was solely associated with their experiences of domestic violence, not with community violence. Results are discussed in terms of an ecological model of domestic violence & future directions for exploring linkages between neighborhood characteristics & individual experiences.

Effects of Intimate Partner Violence on Low-Income Women's Health and Employment

Author: Staggs, Susan L1; Riger, Stephanie1 c/o Riger -- U Illinois, Chicago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59986505?accountid=14925

Abstract: Rates of both intimate partner violence & poor health are high among low-income women This paper examines relationships among abuse, health, & employment stability using data from a 3-year study of over 1,000 female welfare recipients in Illinois. Results demonstrate the importance of accounting for both recency & chronicity of intimate partner violence & understanding the mediational role of health in the relationship between intimate partner violence & employment. Chronic intimate partner violence is associated with poor health, whereas recent intimate partner violence is associated with unstable employment. Mediations analyses suggest that health does not mediate the effects of abuse on employment stability over a 3-year period. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Women's Employment: Fixed Effects Models of Three Waves of Women's Employment Study Data

Author: Tolman, Richard M1; Wang, Hui-Chen1 School Social Work, U Michigan, Ann Arbor rtolman@umich.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389867?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence can interfere with women's ability to work, & may result in loss of welfare benefits & poorer economic outcomes. Previous studies showing no effect of domestic violence on employment could be a result of the failure to control for some individual characteristics; therefore we use fixed-effects models with three waves of Women's Employment Study (WES) data to control for unobservable time-invariant individual-specific characteristics. Included in our analyses were 598 women, from an urban county in Michigan who were on the welfare rolls in February of 1997, all of whom completed 3 waves of interviews. Our fixed effects regression results show that domestic violence significantly reduced the annual work hours of a respondent. Mental & physical health problems do not completely mediate this relationship. Our results support efforts to address domestic violence within the welfare system. Tables, References.

Neo-Liberalism and the Pathologising of Public Issues: The Displacement of Feminist Service Models in Domestic Violence Support Services

Author: McDonald, John11 Centre Health Research and Practice, U Ballarat, Australia j.mcdonald@ballarat.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61390426?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using domestic violence support services as a case study, this paper examines how the ascendancy of neo-liberalism has individualised and pathologlsed public issues. Four perspectives are identified that have been influential in understanding the causes of domestic violence, determining responses to it and measuring the effectiveness of support services. These four perspectives may be categorised as: (i) victim-blaming; (ii) social movement; (iii) empowerment; and (iv) pathologising. From analysing the standard outcome measures currently used for government-funded accommodation programs, the author contends that the pathologising perspective dominates. This is partly attributable to the inherent methodological and ethical issues in evaluating programs of this nature. However, it is primarily driven by the ascendancy of a neo-liberal, managerialist ideology that has depoliticised and clinicalised domestic violence. This has effectively silenced structural analyses of domestic violence and displaced feminist service models. Adapted from the source document.

Marginality and the New Geography of Domestic Violence Policy in Post-Communist Poland

Author: Brunell, Laura11 Dept Political Science, Gonzaga U, Spokane, WA brunell@gonzaga.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60011643?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article explores the spatial distribution & institutional geography of domestic violence service provision in post-communist Poland. A new institutional geography providing services to victims of domestic violence is emerging in Poland as a result of NGO activism & new pro-woman policies implemented by the state. NGOs, often in partnership with local governments, are the most vital means of service provision in large & medium size cities, while in rural areas, public agencies predominate in the institutional geography of service provision. The assumption that NGOs will emerge to address the needs of victims of domestic violence is not realistic in rural areas. While urban Poland is developing an institutional geography to address domestic violence, state & NGO activists must focus on shrinking the rural margins of Poland's institutional geography.

Theorizing Police Response to Domestic Violence in the Singaporean Context: Police Subculture Revisited

Author: Narayanan, Ganapathy11 Dept Sociology, National U Singapore socng@nus.edu.sg

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60034367?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article focuses on the well documented, yet potentially contested concept of rank-&-file police subculture to conceptualize police response to situations of domestic violence in Singapore. It argues that the utility of the concept to explaining police behavior is often undermined by an all-powerful, homogenous, & deterministic conception of it that fails to take into account the value of agency in police decision-making & the range of differentiated police response in situations of domestic violence. Through reviewing the literature on police response to domestic violence, this study called for the need to rework the concept of police subculture by treating it as having a relationship with, & response to, the structural conditions of policing, while retaining a conception of the active role played by street-level officers in instituting a situational practice. Using Pierre Bourdieu's relational concepts of "habitus" & "field", designating the cultural dispositions of police subculture & structural conditions of policing respectively, the study attempted to reconceptualize the problem of policing domestic violence with reference to the Singaporean context.

Portuguese Immigrant Women's Perspctives on Wife Abuse: A Cross-Generational Comparison

Author: Barata, Paula C1; McNally, Mary Jane; Sales, Isabel M; Stewart, Donna E1 University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60038328?accountid=14925

Abstract: This descriptive study seeks to understand what first & second generation Portuguese women believe about wife abuse & what actions they believe are appropriate for an abused wife. Eighty first generation & 54 second generation women participated. The researcher read the questionnaire items aloud in one-on-one meetings. Overall, participants defined wife abuse broadly, did not approve of wife abuse, were most likely to believe that women should seek external help, & did not hold strong patriarchal beliefs. However, a number of generational differences were found. Second generation women were more likely to label an abusive behavior as abuse, & first generation women were more likely to approve of abuse, endorse indirect or traditional options to deal with wife abuse, & hold stronger patriarchal beliefs. The study's implications for research & practice within Portuguese communities are discussed. 2 Tables, 1 Appendix, 40 References.

Disjunctures for Women and Frontline Workers: Implementation of the Family Violence Option

Author: Lindhorst, Taryn1; Padgett, Julianna D1 U Washington, Seattle

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61310982?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research uses analysis of qualitative interviews with 10 battered welfare clients & 15 frontline welfare workers to examine the implementation of the Family Violence Option (FVO) under welfare reform. States adopting the FVO agree to screen for domestic violence, refer identified victims to community resources, & waive program requirements that would endanger the women or with which they are unable to comply. The analyses find that none of the 10 clients in this study received these services. This lack of services reflects four critical disjunctures between the formal policy & the policy experienced by the clients. It also reveals several more basic structural factors that provide conflicting mandates to frontline workers.

Does the Life History Calendar Method Facilitate the Recall of Intimate Partner Violence? Comparison of Two Methods of Data Collection

Author: Yoshihama, Mieko; Gillespie, Brenda; Hammock, Amy C; Belli, Robert F; Tolman, Richard M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61335416?accountid=14925

Abstract: Respondents' recall ability may compromise the validity of their report of lifetime experience of intimate partner violence (IPV). This study compared two interview methods: a commonly used structured interview method & the Life History Calendar (LHC) method, which combines a visual calendar with a semistructured interview schedule to help respondents gain better access to long-term memory. Comparison of two studies conducted with samples drawn from the same sampling frame found that, as hypothesized, the LHC method elicited more reports of lifetime IPV -- especially abuse that occurred early in respondents' lives -- than a structured interview survey method.

Intimate Partner Violence, Substance Use, and HIV among Low-Income Women: Taking a Closer Look

Author: Burke, Jessica G1; Thieman, Laura Knab; Gielen, Andrea C; O'Campo, Patricia; McDonnell, Karen A1 Dept Population & Family Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382545?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article focuses on the intersection of intimate partner violence (IPV), substance use, & HIV status among a sample of low-income urban women (n = 611). Differences emerged by drug type, categorization of IPV, & HIV status. Rates of IPV did not differ between HIV-negative & HIV-positive women, but differing rates of substance use were found to be highly significant. The relationship between IPV & drug use appeared to be stronger for HIV-negative women. Descriptive data capturing temporal relationships between substance abuse & IPV support continued examination of types of IPV separately. These findings indicate the need to create comprehensive intervention strategies to address all three issues.

R & B: A Conversation between a Researcher and a Battered Woman about Domestic Violence Fatality Review

Author: Websdale, Neil11 Northern Arizona U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61607625?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence fatality review is defined as the deliberative process whereby communities and their various domestic violence agencies identify homicides and suicides traceable to domestic violence and then, based on the evidence, suggest preventive interventions. To highlight the issues concerned, this article presents a dialogue of a conversation between an imaginary researcher and an imaginary battered woman in which the latter is highly critical of the process.

The Nature and Impact of Domestic Violence across Age Cohorts

Author: Wilke, Dina J1; Vinton, Linda1 Coll Social Work, Florida State U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60545150?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the nature & extent of domestic violence & its impact on psychosocial functioning among women of different age groups. No differences were found across age groups in the severity of violence, nature of injuries, use of alcohol or drugs at the time of the incident, attribution of blame, likelihood to report violence, or rates of childhood physical abuse & depression. However, the older women were more likely to have experienced violence for a longer time, to be in current violent relationships, & to have health & mental health problems than were the younger women. These similarities & differences are discussed in terms of interventions. 3 Tables, 29 References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2005.]

Survivors' Opinions about Mandatory Reporting of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault by Medical Professionals

Author: Sullivan, Cris M1; Hagen, Leslie A1 Dept Psychology, Michigan State U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61491620?accountid=14925

Abstract: Sixty-one survivors of domestic or sexual abuse participated in focus groups to discuss their perceptions of mandatory reporting by health care professionals. Only one participant believed that medical providers should notify the police when a woman seeks treatment. This survivor's experience was different from that of most of the other participants in that she was raped by a stranger. The remaining participants were unanimous in their belief that medical reporting should not be mandatory until a number of changes are made in the system to promote victims' safety. The survivors shared numerous examples of having been re-victimized by the child protection system, health care system, mass media, & especially the criminal legal system. Practice, policy, & research implications are discussed. 21 References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2005.]

The Influence of Mandatory Arrest Policies, Police Organizational Characteristics, and Situational Variables on the Probability of Arrest in Domestic Violence Cases

Author: Eitle, David11 School of Policy and Management, Florida International University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811949668?accountid=14925

Abstract: Prior research into factors predicting arrest in domestic violence cases is limited in three regards: (a) no examination of whether mandatory arrest policies are associated with increased risk of arrest across multiple jurisdictions; (b) little consideration of whether police organizational characteristics influence arrest in such cases; and (c) little examination of whether mandatory arrest policies moderate the influence of extralegal characteristics on arrest risks. Using year 2000 data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System and the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics, a nonlinear hierarchical modeling procedure was employed to evaluate the predictive utility of situational and organizational factors associated with arrest probability in domestic violence cases. The results suggest that, in domestic violence cases, mandatory arrest policies predict arrest and modestly reduce the significance of race as a predictor of arrest. The results are interpreted as supporting a constrained rational model of policing.[/italic

Serving Two Masters: When Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Overlap

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61323270?accountid=14925

Abstract: Does exposure to domestic violence indicate a form of child maltreatment? It is imperative that child welfare workers identify & use interventions that protect families from domestic violence & eliminate harm to children without further stigmatizing victimized women. The research described in this article attempts a first step in understanding the factors involved in the decision making process of child welfare supervisors in domestic violence cases. Findings indicate that the attitudes & beliefs of child welfare supervisors about the overlap between domestic violence & child abuse are influenced by personal experiences, professional longevity, & training.

Implications of an Arrest in Domestic Violence Cases: Learning from Korean Social Workers' Experiences in the U.S.

Author: Shim, Woochan S1; Hwang, Myung Jin1 School Social Welfare, U Kansas, Lawrence shimw@ku.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60005941?accountid=14925

Abstract: In response to the lack of research on the effect of arrest in deterring domestic violence in minority communities, a qualitative exploratory study was conducted with Korean American social workers providing services to Korean domestic violence victims in the New York metropolitan area. The authors examined study participants' perceptions about their clients' experiences of arrests in domestic violence situations. Findings reveal major barriers for Korean victims that prevent them from utilizing help from the police. Main themes from the data show both negative & positive results from arrests. Participants perceived arrest as an ultimately necessary tool for deterring domestic violence in the Korean community in the U.S. Participants suggested some changes in the criminal justice system to better respond to immigrant victims of domestic violence. Practice & policy implications are discussed. References. Adapted from the source document.

Sex of Spouse Abuse Offender and Directionality of Abuse as Predictors of Personal Distress, Interpersonal Functioning, and Perceptions of Family Climate

Author: Taylor, Lisa1; Pittman, Joe F1 c/o Pittman -- Dept Human Development & Family Studies, Auburn U, AL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61404808?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines perceptions of personal distress, interpersonal functioning & family climate reported by men & women involved in unidirectional versus bidirectional spouse abuse. Participants were 7253 offenders treated by the USAF Family Advocacy Program from 1988 to 1996. Over a quarter of the sample is female & included among them were both unidirectional & bidirectional offenders. Grouping factors for the analysis are gender, directionality of aggression, history of abuse in childhood, history of recidivism, & severity of aggression. Females & offenders raised in abusive homes reported more negative perceptions across the measured spheres. Unidirectional abusers reported more personal distress, but bidirectional abuse had more conflicted family climates. Few differences were noted in offenders' perceptions based on the severity of their abuse or their history of repeat offenses. Tests for interactions yielded no reliable pattern indicating that grouping factors were related to outcomes in an additive fashion. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Attitudes and Beliefs about Domestic Violence: Results of a Public Opinion Survey: I. Definitions of Domestic Violence, Criminal Domestic Violence, and Prevalence

Author: Carlson, Bonnie E1; Worden, Alissa Pollitz1 School Social Welfare, U Albany, State U New York

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59991603?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study reports analyses & findings from a public opinion survey designed to explore beliefs about domestic violence (DV) -- what it is, when it is against the law, & how prevalent it is. The project interviewed 1,200 residents from six New York communities. The analyses reveal substantial firsthand & secondhand experience with DV & strong consensus that acts of physical aggression should be labeled as DV, but substantially less certainty about the illegality of the abusive behaviors. Overall, the respondents were less inclined to define women's aggressive behavior in pejorative or unlawful terms than men's. Respondents believed that DV was common in their communities, & that it affected a significant minority of couples. Multivariate analyses provide little support for conventional wisdom about the impact of socioeconomic background on tolerance for or knowledge about DV, although gender, generation, & secondhand familiarity with DV incidents play a role in opinions & beliefs.

Weve Had Training, Now What? Qualitative Analysis of Barriers to Domestic Violence Screening and Referral in a Health Care Setting

Author: Minsky-Kelly, Debbie1; Hamberger, L Kevin; Pape, Deborah A; Wolff, Marie1 All Saints Healthcare, Inc., Racine, WI

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60029481?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study assesses barriers to identification & referral of domestic violence (DV) victims by staff at a health care institution following a 3-hr DV training program in which 752 health care providers participated. Focus groups are conducted with staff in hospital departments that serve a high volume of women. Responses to focus group questions identify system-wide & individual hospital department barriers. These barriers have implications for health care organizations trying to implement DV screening protocols through training alone to change staff behavior in diverse clinical settings. Limitations of this study & future research recommendations are also discussed. References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2005.]

Community-Based Norms about Intimate Partner Violence: Putting Attributions of Fault and Responsibility into Context

Author: Taylor, Catherine A1; Sorenson, Susan B1 Tulane School Public Health & Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, LA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61372141?accountid=14925

Abstract: Fault & responsibility are key concepts in understanding how victims & assailants are, or are not, held accountable by society. We used a fractional factorial vignette design with a community-residing sample of 3,679 adults to examine judgments about intimate partner violence (IPV). Although fault, or causal responsibility, was assigned most often to assailants (69%), respondents assigned solution responsibility most often to both persons (52%) or to the victim alone (31%): interpersonal communication for couples (38%) & self-protective actions for victims (i.e., engaging formal authorities [12%] &/or leaving the assailant [11%]) were the most frequent suggestions. Potential injury to the victim & gender/relationship-based norms had the greatest impact on judgments. Findings may inform strategies to alter social norms regarding IPV. Tables, References.

Author: Sagot, Montserrat11 U Costa Rica

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60004972?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research examined the critical path followed by women from 10 Latin American countries who suffer family violence. It identified the personal & social processes women experience as a result of their help-seeking actions & the kinds of responses found at local services. The study used an action-oriented qualitative methodology with a standard research protocol that was translated & adapted for the various ethnic groups. The results provided community actors with an understanding of the barriers women face in overcoming the obstacles, humiliation, & inadequate responses they encounter along their critical paths.

Immigrant Latinas' Conceptualizations of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Adames, Sandra Bibiana1; Campbell, Rebecca1 Clinical Psychology Program, U Illinois, Chicago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61377839?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study was a qualitative investigation of the conceptualization of intimate partner violence (IPV) among immigrant Latinas. The research approach used was naturalistic inquiry: conducting research maintaining minimal interference with the phenomenon of interest. Findings revealed that the immigrant Latinas in this study were aware of the poor quality of intimate relationships in their community, were knowledgeable about IPV, & understood that IPV is an extensive problem in the immigrant Latino community. In addition, the women recognized gender disparities & other ecological factors as central issues affecting their intimate relationships & leading to IPV. References.

Patterns of Intimate Partner Violence: Correlates and Outcomes

Author: Dutton, Mary Ann1; Kaltman, Stacey; Goodman, Lisa A; Weinfurt, Kevin; Vankos, Natalie1 Dept Psychiatry, Georgetown U Medical Center, Washington, DC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61285784?accountid=14925

Abstract: Battered women experience different constellations of violence & abusive behavior characterized by various combinations of physical violence, sexual violence, psychological abuse, & stalking. The goals of the current study were to determine whether it was possible to identify empirically derived & meaningful patterns of intimate partner violence (IPV) & to examine correlates & outcomes of the IPV patterns. Three IPV patterns were identified using cluster analysis. Pattern 1 was characterized by moderate levels of physical violence, psychological abuse, & stalking but little sexual violence. Pattern 2 was characterized by high levels of physical violence, psychological abuse, & stalking but low levels of sexual violence. Pattern 3 was characterized by high levels of all violence types. IPV Pattern 3 was associated with the highest prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder & depression, & IPV Pattern 2 had the highest levels of re-victimization during the year following recruitment. The clinical & policy implications of the findings are discussed. Tables, Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

Dating Violence and Sexual Risk Behaviors in a Sample of at-Risk Israeli Youth

Author: Schiff, Miriam1; Zeira, Anat1 Paul Baerwald School Social Work Social Welfare, Hebrew U, Jerusalem, Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59995134?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: This exploratory study examines the reported dating violence & its association with sexual risk behavior among Israeli adolescents, who are at risk for dropping out of school. Methodology: A convenience sample of 105 at-risk youth (51 boys & 54 girls) completed self-administered anonymous, questionnaires in small same-gender groups. The questionnaire included a Hebrew version of the Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory, a valid scale developed in the US especially for adolescents, the Hebrew version of the Conflict Tactics Scale & the Self-Efficacy to Refuse Sexual Behavior Scale. Results: We found high rates of perpetration of verbal-emotional abuse for both girls & boys. Rates of reported victimization by physical abuse were higher among boys but that by sexual abuse were higher among girls. We found a moderate inverse association between victimization by dating violence & practicing safe sex among girls. There was a similar but much stronger association for boys who were victims of dating violence. Conclusions: The high rates of various types of dating violence in Israel, at least among at-risk adolescents, should raise concern & motivate designing & implementing specific prevention interventions. The high reported rates of victimization from dating violence among boys are somewhat surprising & call for special attention & more indepth studies. Tables, References.

Abstract: Domestic violence (DV) & child maltreatment co-occur in many families & this may lead to involvement with child welfare services (CWS). This study explores the role of domestic violence in CWS using data from the National Survey of Child & Adolescent Well-Being, a large, national probability sample of families investigated for child maltreatment. It relies on child welfare worker report of active DV or a history of DV to examine the association of DV with child maltreatment type, substantiation, & placement of children into out of home care. Maltreatment type classification was similar for children with & without exposure to DV. Families with active DV were substantiated for child maltreatment at higher rates than other groups, but DV was not a powerful contributor to the CWS decision-making process. Families with co-occurring DV & maltreatment often had high levels of cumulative risks, & children in families with the highest level of cumulative risk were 10 times more likely to be placed into foster care than children in families assessed with low levels of risk. The policy & practice implications of these findings are discussed. 5 Tables, 19 References. [Copyright 2005 Elsevier B.V.]

Domestic Violence in One State's Child Protective Caseload: A Study of Differential Case Dispositions and Outcomes

Author: English, Diana J1; Edleson, Jeffrey L; Herrick, Mary E1 Dept Social & Health Services, State Washington, Seattle

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388772?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite growing attention to the issue of children's exposure to adult domestic violence (DV) there is little systematic information available on the level of DV in the child protective caseload or on the pathways of such cases through these systems. This paper reports an examination of one state's child maltreatment reports during a 1-year period. A random sample of 2000 of cases is used to project the state's experience with cases in which DV was indicated -- from initial report to case disposition -- shedding a more accurate light on the child protection response. Pathways & outcomes for DV indicated cases in comparison to those in which no DV was indicated are then presented. Finally, factors that predict re-referral & placement out of home within 1 year of the target referral are compared for DV & non-DV indicated cases. The results of this study reveal that DV was indicated as present in one in five cases referred to child protective services, but in 38% of cases accepted for any level of investigation, & fully 47% of those assigned a moderate to high risk & a high level of investigation. Over half of the DV indicated cases (56%) that were assessed as a moderate to high risk at intake & fully investigated had their cases opened for services, & of these more than four out of five (81%) had at least one child removed from parental custody. Among moderate to high risk cases, those with an indication of DV were significantly more likely to have their cases opened for services & to have at least one child in the family placed in out-of-home care. The factors predicting re-referral to child protective services or placement in out-of-home care within a year after referral differed greatly for cases in which there was or was not an indication of DV. Implications of the results for child welfare practice are discussed. 3 Tables, 4 Figures, 37 References. [Copyright 2005 Elsevier B.V.]

Child Welfare as a Gateway to Domestic Violence Services

Author: Kohl, Patricia L1; Barth, Richard P; Hazen, Andrea L; Landsverk, John A1 School Social Work, U North Carolina, Chapel Hill pkohl@email.unc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388844?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper uses data from the National Survey of Child & Adolescent Well Being to examine the identification of domestic violence (DV) by child welfare workers during investigations of maltreatment & determine how this contributes to the receipt of DV services. The study focuses on female caregivers of children remaining in the home following the investigation (n = 3165). While child welfare workers indicate that active DV is present in only 12% of families investigated for maltreatment, 31% of caregivers reported DV victimization in the past year. The sensitivity of reports of DV is low between caregivers & workers, with both reporting active or recent DV in only 8% of families. Substance abuse by the primary caregiver is a strong predictor of under identification of DV by the child welfare worker (OR = 7.6). Overall, about half of the caregivers with active DV identified by the worker received DV services over the 18 months following the investigation. Logistic regression analyses examined whether receipt of child welfare services (CWS) increases the likelihood that a referral will be made to DV services & whether caregivers will then obtain these services. Both the identification of DV by the worker & having an open CWS case are significant contributors to receipt of DV services. 5 Tables, 37 References. [Copyright 2005 Elsevier B.V.]

Intimate Partner Violence as a Risk Factor for Children's Use of the Emergency Room and Injuries

Author: Casanueva, Cecilia1; Foshee, Vangie A; Barth, Richard P1 Dept Maternal and Children Health, U North Carolina, Chapel Hill

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388901?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the associations between intimate partner violence (IPV) & children's use of the emergency room (ER) for an illness or injury, & care of the child by a doctor or nurse for a serious injury, accident or poisoning. We hypothesized that a mother's mental health (depression, alcohol abuse & drug abuse) & a child's lack of supervision would mediate these associations. Data were from the National Survey of Children & Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW), a national probability study of children investigated for abuse & neglect. The analysis was limited to 2929 female caregivers who were the biological, adoptive, or stepmothers of the children. Exposure of the mother to current severe intimate partner violence was positively associated with children's use of the ER. There was no association between maternal current or past exposure to IPV & children's injuries. Current moderate IPV, current severe IPV & past severe IPV were significantly & positively associated with maternal depression. Maternal depression was not associated with child's lack of supervision. However, maternal alcohol abuse & drug abuse were positively associated with child's lack of supervision. The relationship between IPV & children's use of the ER was mediated by maternal depression. Maternal depression & lack of supervision of the children were positively associated with children's injuries. Identification of maternal IPV & depression during children's ER visits can help guide services to prevent future use of the ER & injuries to children. 4 Tables, 1 Figure, 56 References.

Abstract: The Children & Domestic Violence Services (CADVS) study is a project to collect detailed, contextual data at the state & local levels on the organization & relationship of child welfare services for children, & domestic violence services for women. Although previous research has found a high rate of domestic violence in families involved with child welfare services (CWS), little systematic research on a national scale is available about state & local policies & practices related to these families. The project reported in this article is a supplemental study of the National Survey of Child & Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW), a national probability study of more than 5000 children & adolescents who become involved with CWS. Whereas, the NSCAW study contains detailed information on children & families, the CADVS study uses the same sample as NSCAW to gain information about the way that CWS & domestic violence service (DVS) agencies operate on behalf of victimized children & caregivers. The CADVS study design allows for linkage of this new contextual information to the individual level survey data collected in NSCAW. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the methodology used in CADVS, including sampling, data collection, & instrument development. Future plans for data analyses, including linkage between CADVS & NSCAW, are discussed. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 39 References. [Copyright 2005 Elsevier B.V.]

Domestic Violence and Health Care: Opening Pandora's Box -- Challenges and Dilemmas

Author: Lavis, Victoria1; Horrocks, Christine; Kelly, Nancy; Barker, Val1 School Human & Health Sciences, Divison Psychology, U Huddersfield, UK v.lavis@hud.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388737?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article we take a critical stance toward the rational progressive narrative surrounding the integration of domestic violence within health care. While changes in recent UK policy & practice have resulted in several tangible benefits, it is argued that there may be hidden dilemmas & challenges. We suggest that the medical model of care & its discursive practices position women as individually accountable for domestic violence-related symptoms & injuries. This may not only be ineffective in terms of service provision but could also have the potential to reduce the political significance of domestic violence as an issue of concern for all women. Furthermore, it is argued that the use of specific metaphors enables practitioners to distance themselves from interactions that may prove to be less comfortable & provide less than certain outcomes. Our analysis explores the possibilities for change that might currently be available. This would appear to involve a consideration of alternative discourses & the reformulation of power relations & subject positions in health care. References.

Development of the Intimate Partner Violence Attitude Scales (IPVAS) With a Predominantly Mexican American College Sample

Author: Smith, Brenda A1; Thompson, Sharon; Tomaka, Joe; Buchanan, Amy C1 The University of Texas at El Paso

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810458309?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although instruments that estimate the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) are available, few include potential predictors of violent behaviors such as beliefs and attitudes. The main purpose of this study was to develop a measure of attitudes toward various forms of IPV. The secondary purpose was to examine Mexican American and non-Hispanic White college students' attitudes toward IPV. Data from a sample of 333 predominantly Mexican American (65%) college students were used to determine reliability and factor structure of the final 23-item scale. Principal factor analysis revealed three factors-Abuse, Control, and Physical Violence-with Cronbach alphas of .81, .69, and .70, respectively. The three subscales were positively intercorrelated, at levels that suggest good convergent and discriminate validity. The findings support the possible utility of the scales for predicting IPV. The study did not find significant differences in Mexican American and non-Hispanic White college students' attitudes toward IPV.

Domestic Violence Survivors' Forums in the UK: Experiments in Involving Abused Women in Domestic Violence Services and Policy-Making

Author: Hague, Gill11 Violence against Women Research Group, School Policy Studies, U Bristol, UK Gill.Hague@bristol.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59993503?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper showcases the pioneering work of the first few key domestic violence survivors' forums in the UK with brief descriptive accounts of three innovators in the field: Croydon Domestic Violence Survivors' Forum, Voice for Change & the Phoenix Group. These groups form part of attempts to involve survivors of domestic violence in policy & service development. The women's activist movement against violence against women has led the way in putting domestic violence on the policy agenda & has always had polices of empowerment & of raising silenced voices. For example, Women's Aid & other women's services have operated policies of attempting to encourage the participation of women using their services, although this work has decreased somewhat in recent years. Now that responses to domestic violence are being mainstreamed in the UK, it is important to ask whether statutory agencies & inter-agency domestic violence forums are learning from the activist projects & attempting to achieve meaningful participation for service users & other abused women. This paper discusses whether the views of domestic violence survivors are both heard & heeded by professionals. It addresses the sensitivities & difficulties involved & the importance of informing services with survivor voices. While focusing principally on domestic violence survivors' forums, the paper makes a variety of suggestions for good & innovative practice. References. Adapted from the source document.

Depressive Symptoms in Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Houry, Debra1; Kaslow, Nadine J; Thompson, Martie P1 Dept Emergency Medicine, School Medicine, Emory U, Atlanta, GA Dhoury@emory.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60015086?accountid=14925

Abstract: The study was a cross-sectional examination of African American women positive for intimate partner violence (IPV) who presented to the medical or psychiatric emergency department (ED) for treatment. African American women with a recent history of IPV who presented following an attempted suicide (n = 100) were compared to demographically comparable African American women who were IPV positive who had not attempted suicide & presented for treatment of another condition (n= 100). Women completed face-to-face interviews on several measures, including demographics & the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Overall, there were no demographic differences between cases & controls. Attempters reported statistically significant higher scores on all 21 BDI-II items than did nonattempters. Four BDI-II items had effect size values in the medium range: sadness, self-dislike, suicidal thoughts, & feelings of worthlessness. These four items can be used as a brief screen in the ED to detect female patients positive for IPV at increased risk for suicidal behavior. Tables, References.

Utility of Hospital Emergency Department Data for Studying Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Saltzman, Linda E1; Mahendra, Reshma R; Ikeda, Robin M; Ingram, Eben M1 Centers Disease Control & Prevention

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59983789?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors examine 12 months of emergency department visit data (N = 2,521) from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Program & explore its utility for measuring & studying intimate partner violence. Given the dearth of national data on intimate partner violence-related injury & its potential value for public health surveillance & prevention, the data set appears promising for estimating national rates of emergency department visits. Missing perpetrator-patient relationship data limit estimation of intimate partner-related hospital visits for injury & pain, which precludes national rate estimation at this time, but the data are still useful for describing documented intimate partner violence cases & may be helpful in designing prevention strategies.

The Needs of Pacific Women When They Are Victims of Family Violence

Author: Koloto, 'Ana Hau'alofa'ia1; Sharma, Sashi1 c/o Sharma -- U Waikato

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59981728?accountid=14925

Abstract: A concern about the dearth of research data on the specific needs of Pacific victims of crime led to a study which explored the needs of Pacific people who have been victims of three types of crime: violence, family violence & property offences. The study was designed to provide qualitative information to complement the quantitative information provided by the second New Zealand National Survey of Crime Victims 2001. Various Pacific theoretical frameworks for research were utilised to inform the design & analysis used in this study. This paper focuses on the women in that sample, & considers the needs of Pacific women who are victims of family violence. The findings indicate that victims of family violence were at different stages of dealing with the impacts of the violence inflicted by other members of their families. The paper concludes by suggesting some implications for social policy. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

The Social Sanctioning of Partner Abuse: Perpetuating the Message That Partner Abuse Is Acceptable in New Zealand

Author: Giles, Janice R1; Curreen, Helen M; Adamson, Carole E1 School Psychotherapy, Division Public Health & Psychosocial Studies, Faculty Health, Auckland U Technology, New Zealand janice.giles@aut.ac.nz

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61387243?accountid=14925

Abstract: The pace of cultural change is slow, & informal social sanctions that support the abuse of women by male partners continue to undermine the effectiveness of legislation & policy. The perceptions of New Zealand women in a grounded theory study identified "blaming the victim" & inadequate enforcement of existing sanctions against abusers as social constraints to victim disclosure & recovery. From very early in the relationship women learn to fear punishment for disclosure when friends, community & social service providers respond by blaming the woman for causing the abuse, or blaming her for staying in the relationship. Women's recovery from experiencing abuse by a male partner is a slow process & requires clarification of the attribution of blame, & resolution of the unfairness of their experience. Recovery can be impeded by social responses that blame women, or discount women's experiences of abuse. Processes of personal identity development are relevant to participants' experience &, despite constraints to maintaining separation, women who recover achieve considerable personal growth.

Considering the Interplay of Cultural Context and Service Provision in Intimate Partner Violence: The Case of Haitian Immigrant Women

Author: Latta, Rachel E1; Goodman, Lisa A1 Boston Coll

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60001461?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study explored how the cultural context of intimate partner violence affected accessibility to mainstream services for one immigrant group: Haitian women. Analysis of the data revealed two major themes. First, the nature & context of intimate partner violence in the Haitian immigrant community contribute to Haitian women's reluctance to seek services as well as their overall vulnerability to intimate partner violence. Second, mainstream services are largely inaccessible to Haitian women. The authors conclude with suggestions for overcoming cultural barriers through education, increasing cultural competency of mainstream services, & creating alternative community-based services.

Prevalence, antecedent causes and consequences of domestic violence in Myanmar

Author: Kyu, Nilar1; Kanai, Atsuko1 Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61656356?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study explored women's experiences of domestic violence in Myanmar. In particular, the study examined the relation between antecedents and outcomes of their experiences as well as influences of attribution styles, response styles and different types of violence on their experiences. Using the Myanmar version of the Revised Conflict Tactic Scale, survey data from a representative sample of 286 women in Myanmar were conducted. Results indicated that 27% of women experienced physical assault and 69% of women experienced psychological aggression in a 1-year period. The factors associated with increased risks of violence included witnessing parental violence, husbands' unemployment, husbands' frequent alcohol use, and women's feminism attitudes. Severe physical assault was a strong predictor of negative outcomes and formal intervention. Formal intervention was related to fewer negative outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

The Social Worker as Family Mediator: Balancing Power in Cases Involving Family Violence

Author: Flynn, David11 Yarra Valley Community Health Service, Melbourne davidflynn@netspace.net.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61350205?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper explores power differentials in family mediation, with particular regard to cases involving family violence. The issue of power balancing is examined in relation to the neutrality of the mediator, which is discussed in the context of the social work profession. The paper argues that social workers have a clear ethical responsibility to support & empower the weaker party during family mediation. The paper examines the issue of family violence, where power differentials are at their most extreme, & the debate as to whether cases involving family violence are appropriate for family mediation. The paper argues that, given the high incidence of family violence in contemporary society, & the inadequacies of the traditional adversarial court process, these families should not be prevented from accessing the benefits of mediation. Techniques for mediating in cases involving family violence are presented. References. Adapted from the source document.

Gender-Role Stereotypes and Perceptions of Heterosexual, Gay and Lesbian Domestic Violence

Author: Seelau, Sheila M1; Seelau, Eric P1 Dept Psychology, Chatham Coll, Pittsburgh, PA sseelau@chatham.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59999058?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although domestic violence occurs in all types of relationships, non-prototypical cases (e.g., gay male, lesbian, female-against-male) are often overlooked. We replicated & extended previous research demonstrating that perceptions of heterosexual & same-sex domestic violence are generally consistent with gender-role stereotypes. Male & female undergraduates read one of four domestic abuse cases varying by victim & perpetrator sex & sexual orientation. Victim sex, rather than sexual orientation, was the most potent predictor of responses, although male-against-female violence was considered the most serious & deserving of active intervention. Domestic violence perpetrated by men or against women was judged more serious than violence perpetrated by women or against men. Perceptions that male perpetrators were more capable of injuring victims, & female victims were more likely to suffer serious injury were consistent with gender-role stereotypes. Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Decisions to Leave Dating Relationships: A Test of the Investment Model

Author: Rhatigan, Deborah L1; Street, Amy E1 U Houston-Downtown

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60009723?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explored the impact of violence exposure on investment-model constructs within a sample of college women involved in heterosexual dating relationships. Results generally supported the "common sense" hypothesis, suggesting that violence negatively impacts satisfaction for & commitment to one's relationship & is positively associated with intentions to leave. Exposure to psychological abuse uniquely impacted intentions to leave relationships above & beyond other model factors, suggesting that this may be a particularly important factor in determining college women's decisions. In a series of analyses examining the investment model within each of two groups (e.g., those exposed or not exposed to physical violence), results showed that the model predicted victimized women's decisions to leave as well as it predicted nonvictimized women's decisions. Taken together, results of this study suggest that victimized women base their relationship termination decisions on the same information as nonvictimized women do. Tables, References.

Male versus Female Intimate Partner Violence: Putting Controversial Findings into Context

Author: Holtzworth-Munroe, Amy11 Dept Psychology, Indiana U, Bloomington holtzwor@indiana.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59988073?accountid=14925

Abstract: Praise is offered to David M. Fergusson, L. John Horwood, & Elizabeth M. Ridder for the empirical strength of their 2005 article, "Partner Violence and Mental Health Outcomes in a New Zealand Birth Cohort." An attempt is made to compare this study's findings on the rates, consequences, initiation, & mental health outcomes of male vs female domestic violence to the existing body of knowledge on this topic & attempt to explain some discrepancies. Of particular concern is the authors' conclusion that there are few sex differences in violence or its outcomes, a result attributed to the fact that only minor violence was investigated in this sample. Because of its nature as a large, longitudinal study, some key variables could not be investigated & require further research, including motivation for violence, the functional impact of aggression on a partner's behavior, & correlates & predictors of male vs female violence. Ethical issues involved in research on domestic violence & potential misuses of findings on "female aggression" are considered. References. K. Hyatt Stewart

Domestic Violence: It's Not about Gender -- Or Is It?

Author: Johnson, Michael P11 Dept Sociology, Pennsylvania State U, University Park mpj@psu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59989054?accountid=14925

Abstract: Comments are offered on an article by David M. Fergusson, L. John Horwood, & Elizabeth M. Ridder (2005), "Partner Violence and Mental Health Outcomes in a New Zealand Birth Cohort" in the context of increasing claims that women can be as violent as men & that domestic violence is not about gender. It is maintained that there are three major types of intimate partner violence, only one of which -- "intimate terrorism" -- primarily perpetrated by males & definitely a gender issue -- is what is commonly thought of as "domestic violence." However, this is not the type of violence examined by Fergusson et al; in fact, their article "is hardly about violence at all." It is argued that significant errors of fact, theory, & intervention result from the authors' failure to acknowledge the different types of intimate partner violence. Nonetheless, their data do attest to the negative mental health outcomes of violence victimization. References. K. Hyatt Stewart

For Women, Breadwinning Can Be Dangerous: Gendered Resource Theory and Wife Abuse

Author: Atkinson, Maxine P1; Greenstein, Theodore N; Lang, Molly Monahan1 Dept Sociology & Anthropology, North Carolina State U, Raleigh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59994769?accountid=14925

Abstract: To explain wife abuse, we offer a refinement of relative resource theory, gendered resource theory, which argues that the effect of relative resources is contingent upon husbands' gender ideologies. We use data from the first wave of the National Survey of Families & Households (N =4,296) to test three theories of wife abuse. Resource theory receives no support. Relative resource theory receives limited support. Gendered resource theory receives strong support. Wives' share of relative incomes is positively related to likelihood of abuse only for traditional husbands. The findings suggest that both cultural & structural forces must be considered to understand marriage as a context for social interactions in which we create our gendered selves.

Dar al-Cyber Islam: Women, Domestic Violence, and the Islamic Reformation on the World Wide Web

Author: Kort, Alexis11 School Oriental & African Studies, U London

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60006156?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper explores evidence of change in Islamic thought via the Internet through an exploration of the role & potential impact that Islamic websites are providing in Dar al-Cyber Islam. I will argue that the Internet has helped to form new concepts of the ummah, ulema & ijtihad (community, scholars & interpretation) specifically for Muslims living in the West, contributing to a trend in Islamic reformation. I will show that the unique position of Muslims living in North America has been integral to the reforming process in Islamic thought. In the second half of this paper I will analyse several Islamic websites, looking to their content on & for women with regards to domestic violence. My case study of websites will show concrete evidence of how new ijtihad on the Internet highlights reforming trends in Qur'anic interpretation & how this can help lead to the further empowerment of Muslim women. Adapted from the source document.

How Has the Violence against Women Act Affected the Response of the Criminal Justice System to Domestic Violence?

Author: Cho, Hunkag1; Wilke, Dina J1 Coll Social Work, Florida State U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61349796?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study uses an interrupted time series design to examine the association between the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA) & several different dimensions of the criminal justice system's involvement in violence against women. These include examining the domestic violence incidence rate, & rates of police notification, arrest, & judicial authorities' involvement. Data from the National Crime Victimization Survey from 1992 to 2003 is used. Results suggest that overall the incidence of domestic violence has decreased while police notification & perpetrator arrest have increased over time. Further, victim involvement with judicial authorities significantly increased after enactment of the VAWA. Interpretations & potential explanations of the results are discussed. Tables, Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

The Influence of Gender Role Stereotypes, the Woman's Race, and Level of Provocation and Resistance on Domestic Violence Culpability Attributions

Author: Esqueda, Cynthia Willis1; Harrison, Lisa A1 Dept Psychology, U Nebraska, Lincoln cwillis-esqueda1@unl.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59985116?accountid=14925

Abstract: The influence of traditional or egalitarian gender role stereotypes on perceptions of domestic violence was investigated when the woman's race & her provocation of & resistance to domestic violence were varied. Two hundred eighty-eight European American participants who varied in their gender role stereotype beliefs provided culpability ratings. A factor analysis reduced culpability items to six concepts. Biases against the African American woman occurred, but not to the European American woman, particularly when she provoked the man. The woman's behavior before & after violence influenced participants' culpability notions, & beliefs in gender role stereotypes influenced perceptions of truthfulness based on race. Implications for the scope of educational programs to enhance support & eliminate biases are discussed. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Explaining Intimate Partner Violence: The Sociological Limitations of Victimization Studies

Author: Michalski, Joseph H11 Dept Sociology, King's University Coll, U Western Ontario, London jmichal2@uwo.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59990464?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examines whether differentiating among types of intimate partner violence enhances the explanatory capacity of extant empirical models. The analysis uses national-level Canadian data to evaluate an alternative approach to operationalizing intimate partner violence, drawing upon Black's (1990) & Johnson's (1995) theoretical work. The main argument suggests that current efforts to explain intimate partner violence with victimization studies are inadequate because they typically do not measure key sociological variables. The failure to assess the contexts within which different types of violence occur further hinders explanatory efforts.The paper concludes with recommendations for innovative theoretical & methodological strategies to address these limitations.

Domestic Violence and Substance Use: Tackling Complexity

Author: Humphreys, Cathy1; Regan, Linda; River, Dawn; Thiara, Ravi K1 School Health & Social Studies, U Warwick, Coventry, UK c.f.humphreys@warwick.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61302089?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence & substance use are issues which pervade social work practice, yet are often on the margins of the knowledge base for practitioners & their managers. This article provides an overview of the literature on substance use & domestic violence, highlighting the problems with the separation of both practice & policy in these areas. Research on substance use & the needs of women survivors of domestic violence are explored, alongside the more substantial literature on perpetrators of domestic violence & patterns of substance use. The problems of a simplistic analysis which suggest that there is a causal link between substance use & domestic violence are highlighted. Using data from an on-going research project, the sources of the continuing & dysfunctional separation of work in these areas are explored.

Giving a Voice to Women Survivors of Domestic Violence through Recognition as a Service User Group

Author: Mullender, Audrey1; Hague, Gill1 c/o Hague -- Domestic Violence Research Group, School Policy Studies, U Bristol, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61297180?accountid=14925

Abstract: Perhaps surprisingly, given the germinal role played by the women's movement, women survivors of domestic violence are not amongst those commonly conceptualized as service user groups. This paper explores why this may be the case & why it matters. It draws upon the findings of a multi-methodological study of specialist domestic violence services & of related user & professional views. It demonstrates the limitations to survivors' influence within these services, some of the key obstacles women experience, & the commonalities & differences between these & the experiences of other user groups. In particular, the specific issues of women still 'being in the experience' & of professionals who are also survivors but who feel unable to disclose this are discussed as useful contributions to the theory of service user involvement.

PTSD Symptoms among Men and Women Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence: The Role of Risk and Protective Factors

Author: Coker, Ann L1; Weston, Rebecca; Creson, Daniel L; Justice, Blair; Blakeney, Patricia1 School Public Health, U Texas, Houston

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61327399?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this cross-sectional analysis of the National Violence Against Women Survey was to characterize current symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among 185 men & 369 women survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV). In this subsample, 24% of women & 20% of men had current moderate-to-severe PTSD symptoms. PTSD scores were higher for women than men. Protective factors that appear to increase resiliency of survivors were higher education & income, being currently married, & reporting that IPV had stopped. Higher physical or psychological IPV scores, current depressive symptoms, & the survivor having left the relationship at least once were associated with risk of moderate-to-severe symptoms of PTSD. Protective factors may be used to boost resiliency of IPV survivors & reduce PTSD symptoms. Tables, Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

Making it through the Criminal Justice System: Attrition and Domestic Violence

Author: Hester, Marianne11 School for Policy Studies, University of Bristol, UK marianne.hester@bristol.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61706052?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores the process of attrition, where domestic violence cases fail to make it through the criminal justice system and do not result in criminal conviction. The article draws on the hitherto most detailed study of such attrition in the UK. The research, carried out across the Northumbria Police Force area, explored the quantitative attrition of domestic violence cases, from reporting to the police to final court outcome, contextualising this via the experiences of individuals (mainly women) victimised by domestic violence as well as the perspectives and practices of the police, prosecutors, the courts and non-criminal justice agencies. Adapted from the source document.

A Consequence of Blurring the Boundaries - Less Choice for the Victims of Domestic Violence?

Author: Hitchings, Emma11 School of Law, Bristol University, UK e.hitchings@bristol.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61677750?accountid=14925

Abstract: If the main aim of civil law is to regulate and improve matters for the future, by, for example, making orders about the future behaviour of parties rather than punishing past behaviour (criminal law), then a fundamental question is whether the civil law is adequately fulfilling these requirements regarding domestic violence. This is a particularly pertinent question given the implementation of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004. This article will examine whether the Government's reforms offer protection to all victims of domestic violence as proposed in the Consultation Paper 'Safety and Justice' and will suggest that instead of achieving a clear coherent framework for dealing with domestic violence, the Act has taken a step towards blurring the boundaries between the criminal and civil law. Adapted from the source document.

Judicialising and (de) Criminalising Domestic Violence in Latin America

Author: Macaulay, Fiona11 Department of Peace Studies, University of Bradford, UK f.macaulay@bradford.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61680027?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article analyses the specific ways in which Latin American countries have judicialised domestic violence over the last decade. In particular, it highlights the new definitions of spousal abuse and procedures adopted in both criminal and non-criminal courts. The region has seen two countervailing tendencies, the first to criminalise, through penal code definitions and higher penalties, the second to divert this offence into legal arenas that tend, either implicitly or explicitly, towards effective decriminalisation and downgrading of this form of social violence due to their emphasis on conciliation and transactional procedures. This has resulted, in many cases, in a two-track, hybridised treatment of domestic violence that is ultimately unsatisfactory in meeting the various needs of women victims. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The current law- & criminal justice-based approach to domestic violence is reevaluated from several perspectives: (1) the US advocacy movement, as concluded in a 2001 summit (DasGupta, S., 2003); (2) a 2004 report by Amnesty International on its "Stop Violence against Women: It's in Your Hands" campaign; & (3) legal scholar Linda Mills (eg, 1998), who suggests that domestic violence be decriminalized & addressed through community-based counseling & mediation rather than the courts. Criticisms that mandatory arrest of domestic violence offenders results in (A) increased violence against women, & (B) racial bias in policing are addressed, & discounted with empirical evidence.

Domestic Violence: Local Activities -- International Issue

Author: Bruckner, Margrit11 Department 4: Health & Social Work, U Applied Sciences Frankfurt/Main brueckn@fb4.fh-frankfurt.de

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61378980?accountid=14925

Abstract: Since violence against women in the family has been made public by the international women's movement beginning in the 1970ies in Western States and after 1989 also in Eastern Europe a rapidly growing number of institutions and networks emerged. There exists a growing number of networks on the level of the European Union, which supports the anti violence work and research on this topic. About 30 years of research mainly in Western post-industrial societies show that in the analysis of violence towards women it is important to differentiate between culturally induced individual (or group) oppression by men and the way this is made possible by societal structures based on gender inequality. Therefore hierarchical family relations and personal behavior of men are one aspect to look at, the structural societal set-up the other. The extent of gender-specific violence can be interpreted as an extreme consequence of the hierarchical construction of gender relations, which seem to justify a personal and sexual subjugation of women and in the extreme even violence towards women. Without this structural component individual violence would not all together fade away, but would lose its societal and cultural back-up. Cross-cultural studies show the interconnection between a comparatively equal gender structure and little gender and generation violence and vice versa. The complexity of gender violence makes a theoretical position necessary which analyzes individual aggression (mostly male) and individual suffering from violence (mostly female) - often over many years - on the background of structural and cultural conditions including the multifaceted connections and breaks between these backgrounds and personal social practices.

Author: Lysova, Alexandra V

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60004049?accountid=14925

Abstract: Presents findings about four (physical, or sexual violence, psychological aggression & traumas) types of dating violence from a survey among 338 Russian students. High rates of violence were found for all four types of violence. Nearly a quarter reported have been attacked by a partner, while 29 per cent say to have perpetrated an assault during previous 12 months. Male & female students were about equally likely to have been victims & perpetrators of every type of violence in question. The data are consistent with those for most other countries with regard to significantly higher level of female violence against their male partners. High rate of sexual violence found ascertainment, & some 62 per cent reported psychological violence. References. Adapted from the source document.

Restorative Justice Models in Cases of Intimate Partner Violence: Reviewing the Evidence

Author: Cheon, Aileen1; Regehr, Cheryl1 University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612502?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite increased public awareness and professional intervention, men's violence against their female partners continues to be a grave reality that challenges those involved to seek better solutions. In recent years, restorative justice has become an established alternative to the criminal justice system for dealing with a number of crimes, and is now starting to be applied to cases of intimate partner violence. However, given the unique social, relational, and psychological contexts of these crimes, doubts are also emerging around the appropriateness of these applications. This paper addresses this debate by reviewing the evidence supporting the use of restorative justice models for various populations, and their ability to address the particular concerns of those affected by intimate partner violence. It explores the fit between restorative justice principles and processes, and what is known about the needs and capacities of this group of victims, offenders, and the communities to which they belong. It is concluded that while the restorative justice model shows promise, there is insufficient evidence at this time to support its use in situations of intimate partner violence.

An Examination of the Effectiveness of Domestic Violence Coordinating Councils

Author: Allen, Nicole E11 U Illinois, Urbana-Champaign

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60032042?accountid=14925

Abstract: The community response to domestic violence has been characterized by a lack of coordination across systems. Recent efforts have focused on bringing together stakeholders from an array of community sectors to promote a comprehensive response. Coordinating councils are commonly employed to encourage such a response, yet little is known about the extent to which they effectively promote community change. This study examined 41 councils in one state to better understand (a) the types of issues they addressed, (b) the extent to which they reported accomplishing their goals, & (c) the degree to which councils' climate & membership influenced the extent to which they achieved their goals within the criminal justice system & in other community sectors (e.g., health care, human service).

Women's Use of Force: Voices of Women Arrested for Domestic Violence

Author: Miller, Susan L1; Meloy, Michelle L1 Dept Sociology & Criminal Justice, U Delaware

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60032078?accountid=14925

Abstract: Following changes in law enforcement policies that encourage or mandate arrest of domestic violence offenders, a concomitant increase in women arrested & mandated to batterer treatment programs has resulted. Most research findings, however, suggest that heterosexual intimate violence is gendered, with abuse, power, & control wielded by men over their female partners, & that when women use violence, it is typically in self defense or for nonaggressive reasons. However, few studies have investigated the female batterer treatment programs & the context of the women's use of violence. Using qualitative data collected from observations of three female domestic violence offender programs, this article examines women's interpretations of their violent experiences. In addition, the findings raise policy-level questions about the appropriateness of such programs, weighing the costs & benefits of a criminal justice approach to women's use of force in intimate relationships.

Intimate Partner Violence and Health Provider Training and Screening in the News

Author: Manganello, Jennifer A1; Webster, Daniel; Campbell, Jacquelyn C1 School of Public Health, Dept Health Policy, U Albany

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61635560?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence is a significant women's health issue. Since the news media can play a role in policy development, it is important to understand how newspapers have portrayed training and screening. The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency and nature of print news coverage of health issues related to partner violence, specifically, provider training and screening by health providers. We conducted a content analysis on articles obtained from major city and state capital daily newspapers from 20 states. News articles and editorials mentioning intimate partner violence and provider training and screening were examined for the years 1994 through 2001 (N = 188). Results showed that print news coverage was limited and received low levels of attention, indicating little potential to influence either policy or individual behavior. However, when the issue was covered, little debate or controversy was present, and a broad discussion of the issue was generally provided. News coverage of training and screening could be improved by increasing dissemination of research results, illustrating the policy implications of these issues, and offering resource information to women experiencing violence.

The Culture of Domestic Violence Advocacy: Values of Equality/Behaviors of Control

Author: Schow, Diana11 Dept Anthropology, Idaho State U, Pocatello campdian@isu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61639597?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence advocacy is a culture unto itself. The themes it addresses, in combination with the dominant frames of discourse (Fairclough, 1989) used in the daily conversations of advocates and their supporters, contribute to the stagnation of domestic violence advocacy as a profession and stunt its ability to address the non-homogenous, culturally diverse group of men, women and children living under the tyranny of violence within their homes. Social and political ties to funding institutions and government agencies reify existing concepts about domestic violence education and allow little opportunity for improvement. This article details the methodology and findings of a qualitative, ethnographic research project conducted at an undisclosed domestic violence agency. Qualitative results were analyzed using methods of grounded theory, discourse analysis and narrative analysis. Results revealed four major discourse themes that contribute to the current culture of domestic violence advocacy: (1) systemic contributions to the normalization of crisis, (2) cultural contradictions between paradigms and practice of domestic violence advocacy, (3) ambiguity over the line between childhood and adulthood and (4) assumptions about "victim-hood.".

Author: Liao, Michael S11 Family Service Agency of San Mateo County, Family Visitation Center, San Mateo E-mail: mlaio_fssm@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61391464?accountid=14925

Abstract: Asian Indian women who immigrate to the United States through arranged marriages are at high risk of experiencing domestic abuse. Professionals working in this arena have identified unique cultural and contextual factors related to abuse experienced by this population. This article provides a taxonomy of the factors related to domestic violence experienced by Asian Indian immigrant women in the United States and their implications for service providers. Acculturation and its implications for battered Asian Indian women's ability to recognize violent acts as abuse is also discussed. This article is aimed at human service providers working with Asian Indian women. In cases of domestic abuse, the various factors discussed must be taken into consideration in providing culturally competent interventions. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence in the United States and Sweden: A Welfare State Typology Comparison within a Power Resources Framework

Author: Peter, Tracey11 Dept Sociology, U Manitoba, Winnipeg

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60022510?accountid=14925

Abstract: The prevalence & impact of domestic violence have been actively addressed in Western democracies, especially since the early 1990s. Although almost all Western countries have responded to this form of violence, little work has studied the issue comparatively on a state or societal level. Comparing the variations of state responses to domestic violence allows for a better understanding of how governments, & their respective agencies such as the police & judiciary, differ in terms of how social provisions are provided. Through a feminist critique, this article addresses this issue through a content analysis of related domestic violence legislation in the United States & Sweden. Specifically, the article argues that differences in how the United States & Sweden respond to domestic violence is best understood when variations of welfare state regimes are examined (needs-based versus universal-based) through a Power Resources perspective (altered to incorporate a feminist perspective), which is based on de-commodification, full employment, & full citizenship.
