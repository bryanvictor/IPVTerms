Specialists in Welfare Offices: Do Family Violence Experts Matter?

Abstract: In many welfare offices, a key component of the Family Violence Option (FVO) of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act was the establishment of experts trained in domestic violence and the new policy. This study analyzes the effect an FVO expert has on three outcomes: domestic violence disclosures; administrative documentation of disclosures; and FVO waiver use. Findings show that the presence of an expert is not related to disclosures or documentation, but does have a statistically significant, negative effect on the likelihood of waiver use. These mixed results indicate that the presence or absence of an expert is not necessarily indicative of an agency's commitment to the FVO. Adapted from the source document.

Shifting Gender Regimes: The Complexities of Domestic Violence among Canada's Inuit

Author: Billson, Janet Mancini11 Group Dimensions International, Woolwich, ME jmbillson@gdiworld.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61637864?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article brings the voices of Inuit women into the discourse on domestic violence as a core issue in their communities. The views of Inuit women interviewed as part of a case study of Pangnirtung, Nunavut Territory between 1988 & 2002 are accompanied by statistics on patterns of domestic violence. The Canadian Government brought the Inuit from the land to this small Baffin Island hamlet during the 1960s. The sources of domestic violence are framed within the context of female well-being & the impacts of resettlement, rapid social change, & women's rights as human rights. Traditional patterns of domestic violence, as reported by Inuit women, are compared to contemporary rates. Inuit women across generations explore the precipitating factors & impacts of domestic violence. Insofar as domestic violence results from shifting (& unbalanced) gender regimes, in this case amplified by rapid social change, it may be a transitional phenomenon. As the Inuit develop new cultural forms, & political & economic stability emerge from the creation of Nunavut, domestic violence rates should decline. Because individual well-being contributes to general social well-being & vice versa, women & their communities are likely to experience a lower level of both objective & subjective well-being until domestic violence has been reduced.

Similarities in the Characteristics and Needs of Women with Children in Homeless Family and Domestic Violence Shelters

Author: Stainbrook, Kristin A1; Hornik, John1 Advocate Human Potential, Albany, NY kstainbrook@ahpnet.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61293799?accountid=14925

Abstract: Public programs like domestic violence shelters & family shelters are developed for a specific purpose, domestic violence & homelessness respectively. Analysis comparing two separate samples (n = 147 & n = 291) of single-female-headed families using either type of shelter found many more similarities than differences between the populations. Among the similarities are the rates of mental health & substance abuse problems, lifetime rates of victimization & trauma, & issues related to poverty, including difficulty paying bills & rent. These similarities suggest families at both types of shelters may have similar service needs, & families at homeless family shelters would benefit from the wider range of services provided to domestic violence clients, including attention to trauma & violence issues.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368724?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study describes marital violence committed against wives working in the academic sector in Medan, Indonesia. Male dominance favoured by the patriarchal culture has influenced the responses of women. The violence documented is comparable with that experienced by women in other countries. The study also suggests that marital violence is found across socio-economic groups. References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright 2006.]

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61400295?accountid=14925

Abstract: A study in an Australian Aboriginal community identified a new way of knowing family violence, locating it in the historical context of colonization, oppression, dispossession, disempowerment, dislocation & poverty. A community development approach to addressing family violence was developed based on this understanding & the strengths of the community. References.

The Process of Coping with Domestic Violence in Adult Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse

Author: Griffing, Sascha1; Lewis, Carla S; Chu, Melissa; Sage, Robert; Jospitre, Tania; Madry, Lorraine; Primm, Beny J1 Urban Resource Instit, Brooklyn NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61377019?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research suggests that the use of disengaged or avoidant strategies to cope with interpersonal violence contributes to the development of depressive symptoms & other psychological difficulties. Survivors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) who are exposed to subsequent episodes of abuse may be more likely to rely on disengaged coping strategies, placing them at elevated risk of psychological symptomatology. In this study, we explored the interrelationships between coping, depression, & self-esteem in an ethnically diverse sample of domestic violence survivors (N = 219) with & without a history of CSA. As predicted, CSA survivors (n = 86) reported significantly greater use of disengaged coping strategies (wishful thinking, self-criticism, & social withdrawal) than non-CSA survivors (n = 133). As hypothesized, both a CSA history & the use of disengaged coping significantly predicted higher levels of depression & lower self-esteem. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed.

The Effect of Question Order on Disclosure of Intimate Partner Violence: An Experimental Test Using the Conflict Tactics Scales

Author: Ramirez, Ignacio Luis1; Straus, Murray A1 Dept Sociology, Texas Tech U, Lubbock l.ramirez@ttu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61604632?accountid=14925

Abstract: Two plausible but contradictory approaches to question order in research on sensitive or criminal behavior are (1) that presenting the questions in a sequence corresponding to a culturally recognized behavior pattern will facilitate disclosure, & (2) that presenting questions in random order will result in more disclosure because random order disrupts response sets. The question order of the original Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS1) used the culturally recognized sequence approach, & the revised CTS (CTS2) used a modified random order. This experiment was designed to determine which of these two question orders results in more disclosure of physical & sexual assault of a dating partner. The standard version of the CTS2, which has the questions from each of the 5 scales interspersed in a slightly modified random order, was administered to every second student in a sample of 417 university students. The other half of the sample were given the same instrument but with the questions in the culturally recognized sequential order used in the CTS1. The cultural sequence order begins with the socially approved behaviors in the Negotiation scale & ends with scales measuring antisocial & the criminal behavior such as the Physical Assault scale. The results indicate that the CTS2 random order produced significantly higher disclosure rates for the scales that measure criminal behavior (Physical Assault, Injury, & Sexual Coercion) & made no difference for the other CTS2 scales (Negotiation & Psychological Aggression). Although these results suggest that the CTS2 random order is the preferred approach, reasons to treat that conclusion with caution are presented. Tables, References.

Fighting Families: Family Characteristics Associated with Domestic Violence in Five Latin American Countries

Author: Flake, Dallan F1; Forste, Renata1 c/o Forste -- Dept Sociology, Brigham Young U, Provo, UT

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61599073?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study uses data from Demographic & Health Surveys (DHSs) to examine the relationship between familial characteristics & the likelihood of experiencing domestic violence in Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Nicaragua, & Peru. Logistic regression techniques are used to measure relationships between marital status, family size, partner alcohol use, socioeconomic status (SES), decision-making power, & education homogamy & the likelihood of experiencing partner violence. Cohabitation, female-dominant decision making, & partner alcohol are positively associated with domestic violence across datasets. Family size, SES, & education homogamy emerged as statistically significant in some, but not all of the datasets. This study helps clarify the profile of the abused Latina & also tests the applicability of current abuse research to a non-Western setting. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Exploring a Community's Response to Lesbian Domestic Violence through the Voices of Providers: A Qualitative Study

Author: Merlis, Suzanne R1; Linville, Deanna1 Center Torture & Trauma, Decatur, GA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388583?accountid=14925

Abstract: Lesbian domestic violence has been frequently denied among lesbian communities & society as a whole. As a result, women involved in same-sex abusive relationships remain isolated, fearful, & reluctant to identify & seek help for the abuse. This study investigated a lesbian community's response to domestic violence in same-sex relationships & the factors impacting the response. The participants included fifteen mental health professionals with expertise in the field of lesbian domestic violence. The phenomenon of "lessening the load" emerged as the central theme that categorized the lesbian community's response to domestic violence. Implications for further research & treatment are also discussed. Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

Understanding the Experiences of Lesbian, Bisexual and Trans Survivors of Domestic Violence: A Qualitative Study

Author: Bornstein, Danica R1; Fawcett, Jake; Sullivan, Marianne; Senturia, Kirsten D; Shiu-Thornton, Sharyne1 c/o Shiu-Thornton -- School Public Health & Community Medicine, U Washington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61655655?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objectives: Using a participatory approach, our objectives were to understand community perspectives on domestic violence (DV) in lesbian, bisexual & trans (LBT) communities, & to assess access to & cultural appropriateness of DV services for LBT survivors. Methods: We used qualitative methods & conducted focus groups & semi-structured interviews with LBT survivors of DV. Results: Nearly all participants reported that the level of awareness regarding DV in their communities was limited. Survivors reported difficulty identifying their partners' behavior as abusive. Isolation was described as central to experiences of abuse, & respondents discussed a variety of isolation tactics specific to LBT communities. Isolation also contributed to difficulty seeking help. Respondents reported that they often did not access mainstream DV services due to concerns about homophobia & transphobia. To address DV in LBT communities respondents pointed to the importance of friendship & community networks, sharing information about queer DV, and holding batterers accountable for their behavior. Conclusions: LBT people face challenges identifying & responding to DV that are specific to their cultural context. Services for LBT DV survivors must be culturally appropriate & accessible. Community-based solutions for addressing & preventing DV should be encouraged. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Social Services Workers' and Supervisors' Perceptions of Domestic Violence Training

Author: Payne, Brian K; Carmody, Diane Cyr; Respass, Gina; Hoofnagle, Kara

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716567?accountid=14925

Abstract: The lack of college coursework on family violence has resulted in a need for professional development focusing on the role of social services workers in domestic violence cases. Very little research, however, has considered how workers define their experiences with domestic violence cases as compared to their perceptions of training in this area. To fill this void, focus groups and in-depth telephone interviews were conducted to assess how social workers and supervisors described their experiences with domestic violence cases and their perceptions of the appropriate forms of training. Results show differences between the experiences and perceptions of workers and supervisors. Adapted from the source document.

Trauma Symptoms among Infants Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Bogat, G Anne1; DeJonghe, Erika; Levendosky, Alytia A; Davidson, William S; von Eye, Alexander1 Dept Psychology, Michigan State U, East Lansing

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61371102?accountid=14925

Abstract: To determine whether infants have a traumatic response to intimate partner violence (male violence toward their female partner; IPV) experienced by their mothers, two questions were explored: (1) Is the number of infant trauma symptoms related to the infant's temperament & the mother's mental health? (2) Does severity of violence moderate those relationships? Forty-eight mothers reported whether their 1-year-old infants experienced trauma symptoms as a result of witnessing episodes of IPV during their first year of life. Mothers also reported on their own trauma symptoms that resulted from experiences of IPV. For those infants experiencing severe IPV & whose mothers exhibit trauma symptoms, we were able to predict whether infants exhibited trauma symptoms (b = .53, p < .01). This was not true for children who witnessed less severe IPV (b = -.14, ns). Maternal depressive symptoms & difficult infant temperament did not predict infant trauma symptoms for either group of infants. Mothers report that infants as young as 1-year-old can experience trauma symptoms as a result of hearing or witnessing IPV. The significant relationship between infant & maternal trauma symptoms, especially among those infants experiencing severe IPV, are consistent with the theory of relational PTSD. Findings suggest that interventions for mothers & families need to consider the influence of the severity of IPV on very young children. Tables, References. [Copyright 2006 Elsevier Ltd.]

Undoing an Activist Response: Feminism and the Australian Government's Domestic Violence Policy

Author: Phillips, Ruth11 School Social Work & Policy Studies, Faculty Education & Social Work, U Sydney, Australia r.phillips@edfac.usyd.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61375659?accountid=14925

Abstract: After nine years of socially conservative government in Australia, national domestic violence policy has shifted its focus from a 'womencentred' & gender-based analytic framework to one that favours the family & reflects individualized, relational explanations of this crucial social policy issue. In exploring this issue, first this paper discusses what is meant by feminism in this context, some of the implications arising out of competing ideas amongst feminist activists in Australia & how feminism drove & influenced national policy. Second, through an examination of the current Australian government's efforts & decisions in relation to its only significant policy response to domestic violence, 'Partnerships Against Domestic Violence', this paper explores the implications of the socially conservative approach of the Howard Coalition Government & why it appears anti-feminist. Through a brief analysis of a national public education campaign launched in 2004, allocation of recent funding & the government's broad political approach to women's policy practice & implementation, questions are raised about the future of a policy that ignores the relationships between domestic violence & gender relations.

The Role of Intimate Partner Violence, Race, and Ethnicity in Help-Seeking Behaviors

Author: Lipsky, Sherry; Caetano, Raul; Field, Craig A; Larkin, Gregory L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61366997?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective. Women experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) have multiple health & social service needs but many, especially Hispanic, women may not access these resources. This research sought to examine the relationship between IPV & health & social services utilization (help-seeking behaviors), with a focus on racial & ethnic disparities. Design. Case-control study from an urban US emergency department population in which cases (women with IPV) & controls (women without IPV) were frequency matched by age group & race/ethnicity. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between IPV & help-seeking behaviors & between help-seeking behaviors & race/ethnicity among abused women. In addition, a stratified analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between acculturation & help-seeking behaviors among Hispanic women. Results. The sample included 182 cases & 147 controls. Among the health services, alcohol program, emergency department, & hospital utilization were significantly increased among IPV victims compared to non-victims after taking demographic & substance use factors into account. Similarly, IPV victims were more likely to access social/case worker services & housing assistance compared to non-victims. Specific help-seeking behaviors were significantly associated with race & ethnicity among IPV victims, with non-Hispanic white & black women more likely to use housing assistance & emergency department services & black women more likely to use police assistance compared to Hispanic women. Among all Hispanic women, low acculturation was associated with decreased utilization of social services overall & with any healthcare utilization, particularly among abused women. Conclusions. Social service & healthcare workers should be alerted to & screen for IPV among all clients. The need for increased outreach & accessibility of services for abused women in Hispanic communities in the USA should be addressed, with cultural & language relevance a key component of these efforts.

Domestic Violence and Housing Rights: A Reinterpretation of the Right to Housing

Author: Paglione, Giulia11 Norwegian Immigration Appeals Board

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60064956?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the connections between domestic violence & the right to housing. While much attention has been paid to domestic violence as a violation of civil & political rights, little has been given to its unquestionable links to the socioeconomic conditions surrounding & leading to the violence. The author suggests that the universally accepted human right to housing specifically includes the right to live free from domestic violence; therefore, this right is blatantly violated when domestic violence occurs. The prevention & eradication of domestic violence should consequently start with the protection of women's right to adequate housing. However, an analysis of the currently existing international instruments addressing violence against women, read together with their main interpretations, will disclose their limitation for women's protection from domestic violence. With an almost exclusive focus on civil & political rights, such instruments disregard women's housing & property rights in their provisions & do not protect battered women where they most need it: at home. Thus, the article also identifies some normative challenges & makes some observations about the solutions that require increased study & attention by international organizations & human rights organizations working with women's rights.

Gender Differences in the Impact of Family of Origin Violence on Perpetrators of Domestic Violence

Author: Kernsmith, Poco11 School Social Work, Wayne State U, Detroit, MI poco@wayne.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61653573?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the applicability of theories related to the intergenerational transmission of violence. Studies of the impact of violence in the family of origin on the propensity to engage in domestic violence as an adult have commonly focused on boys as potential perpetrators. This study examined the impact of previous violent victimization on males & females charged with domestic violence perpetration, finding previous violence significantly related to increased fear & hyper-vigilance to threat in adult relationships. In addition, the study explored the theoretical assertion that those who use violence in their homes are not also generally violent & found that the majority of individuals using violence, both males & females, were not violent outside the home.

The Roles of Victim and Perpetrator Alcohol Use in Intimate Partner Violence Outcomes

Author: Thompson, Martie P1; Kingree, J B1 Clemson University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809354171?accountid=14925

Abstract: Alcohol use increases the risk of intimate partner violence (IPV), yet little research has examined its role in victimization outcomes (e.g., physical injury, police reporting). This study examined the roles of perpetrator and victim incident-specific alcohol use in IPV outcomes. The sample included 501 men and 1,756 women who had experienced an IPV physical assault. Logistic regression analyses showed that after controlling for relevant covariates, women whose partners had been drinking were significantly more likely to be injured than were women whose partners had not been drinking. A woman's own alcohol use was unrelated to victimization outcomes. Men were significantly more likely to report the incident if their partners had been drinking but were marginally less likely to report if they had been drinking. Findings suggest that perpetrators' incident-specific alcohol use is important in understanding which victims are most likely to be injured and report the incident to the police.

Intimate Partner Violence and HIV/STD Risk Among Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Individuals

Author: Heintz, Adam Jackson1; Melendez, Rita M1 New York University Law School

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809353449?accountid=14925

Abstract: To date, there has been little research examining HIV/STD risk among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals who are in abusive relationships. This article uses data collected from a community-based organization that provides counseling for LGBT victims of intimate partner violence (IPV). A total of 58 clients completed the survey, which inquired as to sexual violence and difficulties negotiating safer sex with their abusive partners. A large percentage of participants reported being forced by their partners to have sex (41%). Many stated that they felt unsafe to ask their abusive partners to use safer sex protection or that they feared their partners' response to safer sex (28%). In addition, many participants experienced sexual (19%), physical (21%), and/or verbal abuse (32%) as a direct consequence of asking their partner to use safer sex protection. Training counselors on issues of sexuality and safer sex will benefit victims of IPV.

Changing Coverage of Domestic Violence Murders: A Longitudinal Experiment in Participatory Communication

Author: Ryan, Charlotte1; Anastario, Mike; DaCunha, Alfredo1 U Massachusetts-Lowell

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61378580?accountid=14925

Abstract: Stressing relation-building & participatory communication approaches, the Rhode Island Coalition against Domestic Violence worked with journalists to develop a best practices handbook on news coverage of domestic violence murders. This study compares print coverage of domestic violence murders prehandbook (1996-1999) & posthandbook (2000-2002). Significant changes include increased labeling of the murder of intimates as domestic violence & doubled usage of advocates as sources. As a result, domestic violence murders, previously framed as unpredictable private tragedies, are more commonly framed posthandbook as social problems warranting public intervention. The authors conclude that relation-building approaches can affect news cultures & public discourse when conducted in conjunction with comprehensive participatory communications strategies.

Intimate Partner Violence and Long-Term Psychosocial Functioning in a National Sample of American Women

Author: Zlotnick, Caron1; Johnson, Dawn M; Kohn, Robert1 Dept Psychiatry & Human Behavior, School Medicine, Brown U, Providence, RI

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61374641?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using a nationally representative sample of American married or cohabiting women, this prospective study examined women who reported or denied intimate partner violence (IPV) at wave 1 & compared them on a range of psychosocial outcomes at a 5-year follow-up. This study also examined the rate of divorce or separation during the 5-year interval among women who reported IPV at wave 1 & explored whether certain predictors were related to ending an abusive relationship with an intimate partner during the period. Women with IPV at wave 1, compared to women without IPV, were significantly more likely to experience a greater degree of depressive symptoms & functional impairment & less self-esteem & life satisfaction at the 5-year follow-up. Also, nearly half of the women in an abusive relationship left the relationship within the period. Leaving the abusive relationship was associated with lower individual income & more social support at wave 1. Tables, References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2006.]

In Search of Justice for Domestic and Family Violence: Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Australian Women's Perspectives

Author: Nancarrow, Heather11 Centre Domestic & Family Violence Research, Central Queensland U, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59996245?accountid=14925

Abstract: In 2000, reports of two Australian taskforce investigations considering justice responses to violence against women contained opposing recommendations about the suitability of restorative justice for cases of domestic & family violence. One taskforce was composed entirely of indigenous women while the other was predominantly composed of non-indigenous women. This article analyses interviews with members of each taskforce, confirming a split between indigenous & non-indigenous women on the appropriateness of restorative justice in cases of domestic & family violence. There was some agreement between indigenous & non-indigenous women's views about the potential for combining elements of the criminal justice system & restorative justice, although this potential was conditional on various factors specific to each group of women.

Evaluation of a Police and Social Services Domestic Violence Program: Empirical Evidence Needed to Inform Public Health Policies

Author: Hovell, Melbourne F1; Seid, Arlene G; Liles, Sandy1 c/o Liles -- School Public Health, San Diego State U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60004494?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Family Violence Response Team (FVRT) responded to police calls for domestic violence & provided services to victims. Police records were followed for (a) 327 FVRT clients with an index police visit in 1998 & (b) 498 nonconcurrent controls with an index visit in 1997. Except for marriage, no demographic characteristics were associated with batterer recidivism, as measured by police calls. The between-group odds ratio (OR) suggested that FVRT clients experienced a 1.7 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.2 to 2.5) times greater recidivism rate than controls. Although increased reporting cannot be ruled out, results raise concerns about the effects of domestic violence interventions. Tables, Figures, References.

Protecting Prosecution: Exploring the Powers of Law in an Intervention Program for Domestic Violence

Author: Romkens, Renee11 Instit Policy Research, U Tilburg, Netherlands

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60005051?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article critically analyzes how the criminal justice system centrally situates itself in an intervention program intended to protect victims of domestic abuse & stalking. Based on the first empirical, in-depth study in the Netherlands of an intervention program using electronic technology that is increasingly used in the United States, results indicate how the central role of the criminal justice actors can evoke a shift toward foregrounding prosecutorial interests. Drawing from a critical theoretical understanding of the powers of law & the legal system, the author argues that current tendencies toward criminalization in domestic violence interventions can have an unintended violent impact for victims who are either excluded from the program or are forced into a criminal justice regime that might not be in their primary interest. In this study, women seem to actively navigate the use of the criminal justice system to receive the protection they need. Tables, References.

Predictors of Partner Abuse in a Nationally Representative Sample of Adolescents Involved in Heterosexual Dating Relationships

Author: Roberts, Timothy A1; Auinger, Peggy; Klein, Jonathan D1 Dept Pediatrics, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, VA taroberts@mar.med.navy.mil

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61334897?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article's goals are to identify the characteristics of abusive heterosexual dating relationships among adolescents. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health dataset, an analysis of 4,441 heterosexual relationships was completed using logistic regression models (SAS PROC GENMOD). The associations between being verbally & physically abused were examined with respect to the following relationship characteristics: involvement in sexual intercourse or pregnancy with the relationship partner, description of the relationship as a "special romantic relationship," duration of the relationship, age at relationship initiation, & age difference between partners. The findings indicate that involvement in a sexual or "special romantic" relationship was associated with greater likelihood of being abused in both genders. Increased length of time in the relationship was associated with verbal abuse in both genders. Involvement in a pregnancy was associated with being verbally & physically abused among males. It is thus concluded that relationship characteristics play an important role in the development of abusive relationships among adolescents. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Addressing Intimate Partner Violence in Primary Care: Lessons from Chronic Illness Management

Author: Nicolaidis, Christina1; Touhouliotis, Vasiliki1 Division General Internal Medicine, Oregon Health & Science U, Portland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60040550?accountid=14925

Abstract: Though many studies have documented the high prevalence, morbidity, mortality & costs attributable to intimate partner violence (IPV), it is still unclear how our health care system should address this major public health problem. Many have advocated for routine screening, yet there is still insufficient evidence that routine IPV screening can lead to improved outcomes. Though recognition of IPV is very important, a screening paradigm may not be the optimal way to approach IPV within the health care system. For many patients, exposure to violence is a chronic condition, characterized by long-term abusive relationships, histories of childhood & community violence, multiple associated chronic symptoms, & extra barriers to addressing their other chronic illnesses. Thus, there may be important lessons to be learned from work being done in the area of chronic care. We explore how Wagner's Chronic Care model may guide efforts to improve health care for IPV survivors & may serve as a framework for future research studies. References.

Reliability of Translated Measures Assessing Dating Violence among Mexican Adolescents

Author: Hokoda, Audrey1; Ramos-Lira, Luciana; Celaya, Patricia; Vilhauer, Keleigh; Angeles, Manuel; Ruiz, Serena; Malcarne, Vanessa L; Mora, Marina Duque1 Child & Family Development Dept, San Diego State U, CA ahokoda@sdsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60040575?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on the prevalence & correlates of dating violence in Mexican teens is challenged by the lack of culturally & linguistically appropriate assessment tools. This study modified, translated, & back-translated the Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory (CADRI; Wolfe et al., 2001) & the Attitudes Towards Dating Violence Scales (Price, Byers, & the Dating Violence Research Team, 1999) for Mexican adolescents. Analyses on 307 adolescents (15-18 years old) from Monterrey & Mexicali, Mexico, revealed that most of the translated CADRI subscales & Attitudes Towards Dating Violence Scales had acceptable internal consistency & test-retest reliability coefficients. The study offers some evidence that the measures may be useful in assessing dating violence in Mexican teens. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence, Welfare Receipt, and Health Status of Low-Income African American Women: A Lifecourse Analysis

Author: Yoshihama, Mieko1; Hammock, Amy C; Horrocks, Julie1 University of Michigan School of Social Work, 1080 S. University, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109-1106, USA, miekoy@umich.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811401183?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although the association among intimate partner violence (IPV), welfare receipt, and health status has been well-established, little is known about the temporal sequencing of these events. In a random sample of low-income African American women in an urban Midwestern county, lifecourse data about IPV and welfare receipt were obtained using the Life History Calendar method (D. Freedman, A. Thornton, D. Camburn, D. Alwin, & L. Young-DeMarco, 1988), along with data about mental and physical health status. Controlling for relevant factors, longitudinal analyses found that previous experience of IPV increased women's odds of receiving welfare benefits in a given year, but previous welfare receipt did not. Cumulative IPV, but not cumulative welfare receipt, was associated with current and past-year health problems. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that IPV leads women to turn to welfare assistance, and that compromised physical and mental health due to past cumulative IPV interferes with women's gainful employment.

Feminist Disability Theory: Domestic Violence Against Women with a Disability

Author: Mays, Jennifer M11 School Humanities & Human Services, Carseldine Directorate, Queensland U Technology, Australia j.mays@qut.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389925?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women with a disability continue to experience social oppression & domestic violence as a consequence of gender & disability dimensions. Current explanations of domestic violence & disability inadequately explain several features that lead women who have a disability to experience violent situations. This article incorporates both disability & material feminist theory as an alternative explanation to the dominant approaches (psychological & sociological traditions) of conceptualising domestic violence. This paper is informed by a study which was concerned with examining the nature & perceptions of violence against women with a physical impairment. The emerging analytical framework integrating material feminist interpretations & disability theory provided a basis for exploring gender & disability dimensions. Insight was also provided by the women who identified as having a disability in the study & who explained domestic violence in terms of a gendered & disabling experience. The article argues that material feminist interpretations & disability theory, with their emphasis on gender relations, disablism & poverty, should be used as an alternative tool for exploring the nature & consequences of violence against women with a disability.

Domestic Violence, Single Parenthood, and Fathers in the Setting of Teenage Pregnancy

Author: Tan, Louisa H1; Quinlivan, Julie A1 c/o Quinlivan -- Dept Obstetrics & Gynaecology, U Melbourne, Royal Women's Hospital, Victoria, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60005340?accountid=14925

Abstract: Purpose: To explore the relative impact of demographic & early interpersonal family relationships as associations of fatherhood where the mother is a teenager, compared to where the mother is over 20 years of age. Method: A prospective cross-sectional cohort study was undertaken. Institutional ethics committee approval & informed consent were obtained. Data were analyzed from interviews with consecutive males about to become fathers where the mother was aged less than 20 years (teenage) & compared to information from males about to become fathers where the mother was aged 20 years or more (control). Subjects were interviewed to obtain information covering their early life experiences, demographic information, drug use, opinion of the pregnancy, & future planning. Results: In multivariate analysis, & after controlling for family income & education, the following factors had a significant independent association with fatherhood in the setting of teenage pregnancy: a history of parental separation/divorce in early childhood, exposure to family violence in early childhood, & illicit drug use (ever or in pregnancy). Conclusions: Fathers, in the setting of teenage pregnancy, are more likely to report adverse early family relationships, such as exposure to domestic violence or parental separation or divorce. As such, these fathers may lack a positive role model for parenting & fatherhood. Tables, References. [Copyright 2006 The Society for Adolescent Medicine; published by Elsevier Inc.]

Psychopathology in Women Arrested for Domestic Violence

Author: Stuart, Gregory L1; Moore, Todd M; Gordon, Kristina Coop; Ramsey, Susan E; Kahler, Christopher W1 Brown Medical School and Butler Hospital

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809349679?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the prevalence of psychopathology among women arrested for violence and whether the experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) was associated with Axis I psychopathology. Women who were arrested for domestic violence perpetration and court referred to violence intervention programs (N= 103) completed measures of IPV victimization, perpetration, and psychopathology. Results revealed high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, substance use disorders, borderline personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. Violence victimization was significantly associated with symptoms of psychopathology. Logistic regression analyses showed that sexual and psychological abuse by partners were associated with the presence of PTSD, depression, and GADdiagnoses. Results highlight the potential importance of the role of violence victimization in psychopathology. Results suggest that Axis I and Axis II psychopathology should routinely be assessed as part of violence intervention programs for women and that intervention programs could be improved by offering adjunct or integrated mental health treatment.

Domestic Violence against Women in Egypt -- Wife Beating and Health Outcomes

Author: Diop-Sidibe, Nafissatou1; Campbell, Jacquelyn C; Becker, Stan1 Center Communication Programs, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health, Baltimore, MD

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382116?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research has consistently demonstrated that a woman is more likely to be abused by an intimate partner than by any other person. Many negative health consequences to the victims have been associated with domestic violence against women. Data from the 1995 Egyptian Demographic & Health Survey, a nationally representative household survey, were analyzed for 6566 currently married women age 15-49 who responded to both the main questionnaire & a special module on women's status. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine the association of ever-beating, beating in past year or frequency of beatings in past year with contraceptive use, pregnancy management, & report of health problems. Thirty-four percent of women in the sample were ever beaten by their current husband while 16% were beaten in the past year. Ever-beaten women were more likely to report health problems necessitating medical attention as were women beaten in the past year compared to never-beaten women. Regarding reproductive health, higher frequency of beating was associated with non-use of a female contraceptive method, while ante-natal care (ANC) by a health professional for the most recent baby born in the past year was less likely among ever-beaten women (OR=0.17, p<0.05). Unexpectedly, among professional ANC patients, those ever-abused were more likely to make four or more visits (OR=36.54, p<0.05). In Egypt as elsewhere around the world, wife beating is related to various negative health outcomes. Women's programmes must take domestic violence into account if they want to better address the needs of a non-negligible proportion of their target population. Tables, Figures, References.

Intimate Partner Violence and Women's Depression before and during Pregnancy

Author: Martin, Sandra L1; Li, Yun; Casanueva, Cecilai; Harris-Britt, April; Kupper, Lawrence L; Cloutier, Suzanne1 Dept Maternal & Child Health, U North Carolina, Chapel Hill

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61373525?accountid=14925

Abstract: Depressive symptoms of 95 prenatal care patients were examined relative to the women's experiences of intimate partner violence. Women who were victims of psychological aggression during the year before pregnancy were not at elevated risk for depression except when the psychological aggression was very frequent. However, during pregnancy, psychological aggression was more closely tied to women's depression levels, regardless of its frequency. In addition, women who experienced any level of physical assault or sexual coercion by their intimate partners (before or during pregnancy) had higher levels of depressive symptoms compared to nonvictims.

The Importance of Spirituality in the Lives of Domestic Violence Survivors

Author: Gillum, Tameka L1; Sullivan, Cris M; Bybee, Deborah L1 Urban Health Instit, Johns Hopkins U, Baltimore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61366393?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women with abusive partners utilize a variety of coping strategies to deal with & heal from the violence & sense of betrayal they have experienced. For many women, their trust in a higher power & the support they receive from their faith community is integral to their healing. Of 151 women interviewed for this study, the majority (97%) noted that spirituality or God was a source of strength or comfort for them. Extent of religious involvement predicted increased psychological well-being & decreased depression. For women of color, greater religious involvement was also related to increased social support. Implications for research & direct services are discussed. Tables, Figures, References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2006.]

Responding to the Needs of Older Women Experiencing Domestic Violence

Author: Straka, Silvia M1; Montminy, Lyse1 University-Affiliated Centre Social Gerontology, CSSS Cavendish, Quebec

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60006982?accountid=14925

Abstract: Older women experiencing domestic violence are an invisible group who fall into the gap between two forms of family violence: elder abuse & domestic violence. This article reviews the literature in both fields, describing each paradigm, how it explains & responds to its specific form of violence, & why neither has been able to provide an adequate response to domestic violence against older women. A collaborative response is needed, accounting for both the age & gender dimensions of the problem. References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2006.]

Punitive Action or Gentle Persuasion: Exploring Police Officers' Justifications for Using Dual Arrest in Domestic Violence Cases

Author: Finn, Mary A1; Bettis, Pamela1 Georgia State U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61327743?accountid=14925

Abstract: Mandatory & preferred arrest policies may be resulting in a backlash for victims who are arrested along with their batterers. Little prior research has explored why officers engage in dual arrests. The current study examines the rationales employed by officers to justify dual arrests in a preferred arrest jurisdiction. Content analysis of thought protocols of police officers (n=24) who reported they would arrest both parties was undertaken. Officers justified arrest of both parties, citing that such was required by law & the desire to force both parties to obtain counseling for their relationship. Implications for policy development are examined. References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2006.]

Feminist Social Movements and Policy Change: Devolution, Childcare and Domestic Violence Policies in Wales

Author: Ball, Wendy1; Charles, Nickie1 c/o Charles -- Centre Study Women & Gender, Dept Sociology, U Warwick, Coventry, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60044631?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper focuses on recent developments in Wales in order to explore the extent to which changes in the gendering of political institutions create new opportunities for social movements to influence policy change. We develop a conceptual framework which includes a consideration of the political & discursive opportunity structure, the way issues are framed, & the challenge posed by social movements in terms of redistribution. Using this framework, recent developments in Wales in the context of devolution are analysed. Particular attention is paid to the influence of social movement organisations on the policy-making process in relation to childcare & domestic violence, to the new political & discursive opportunity structures within which social movements are operating, & to the ways in which reframing of key issues within feminist social movements results in their incorporation into the policy agenda but, at the same time, marginalises more radical feminist voices.

Addressing Wife Abuse in Mexican Immigrant Couples: Challenges for Family Social Workers

Author: Hancock, Tina11 BSW Program Director and Associate Professor, Department of Social Work, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61408985?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article addresses wife abuse in undocumented Mexican immigrant couples and suggests an ecosystems treatment approach that takes into consideration the structural forces of oppression and discrimination on abusive behaviors in the home and combines individual, family and community level interventions to help immigrant men stop the abuse. Recognized are limitations on service provisions in rural communities and small towns where many 'newly arrived' immigrants reside. Family service workers in these settings are encouraged to advocate for this population and create culturally competent domestic violence services that draw on formal and informal resources and supports in the social environment.

Animal Cruelty by Children Exposed to Domestic Violence

Author: Currie, Cheryl L11 School Public Health, U Alberta, Edmonton

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61374019?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: The first objective of this study was to determine if children exposed to domestic violence were significantly more likely to be cruel to animals than children not exposed to violence. The second was to determine if there were significant age & gender differences between children who were & were not cruel to animals. Method: A community sample of 47 mothers with two children & a history of domestic violence were compared to a matched sample of 45 mothers with two children who did not have such a history. Results: Children exposed to domestic violence were significantly more likely to have been cruel to animals than children not exposed to violence. The age & gender of children who were cruel to animals did not differ from children who were not cruel to animals. However, exposed children cruel to animals were significantly older than non-exposed children cruel to animals. Conclusion: Animal cruelty by children is correlated with exposure to domestic violence. Tables, References. [Copyright 2006 Elsevier Ltd.]

A Multilevel Approach to Cultural Competence: A Study of the Community Response to Underserved Domestic Violence Victims

Author: Pyles, Loretta1; Kim, Kyung Mee1 School Social Work, Tulane U, New Orleans, LA lorettapyles@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397306?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social workers have often considered cultural competence to be an individual ability or skill (Green;, 1999; Ponterotto, Sanchez, & Magids, 1990). Some scholars, however, have transcended this individual-based approach & addressed cultural competence at the interpersonal, agency & systems levels. (Yan & Wong, 2005; Hyde, 2004). In this study, the authors pursued a multilevel approach to studying cultural competence, conceptualized as the knowledge, attitudes, & skills of individuals, agencies, & wider systems to address the needs of underserved & minority populations. Professionals who work with victims of domestic violence were surveyed to assess cultural competence. There were positive relationships between individual cultural competence & both agency & systems cultural competence, indicating that individual, agency, & systems cultural competence are connected & that a multilevel approach to addressing the needs of underserved individuals could prove useful in promoting the ends of social justice.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61376459?accountid=14925

Abstract: Joint custody & cooperative coparenting are often unsafe for women who leave violent partners. Although certain legal protections are available, more work is needed to understand & address abused women's needs in this context. This study provides divorce scholars & practitioners with information on the interface between separation/divorce & intimate partner violence. We review existing research, policies, & programs & propose directions for intervention & research that center around the unique needs of these families. Tables, References.

Righting Domestic Violence

Author: Choudhry, Shazia1; Herring, Jonathan1 Queen Mary, U London

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60011586?accountid=14925

Abstract: For too long human rights have been used to support a legal approach to domestic violence which is non-interventionist. This article discusses the ways in which human rights can be used to compel an approach to cases of domestic violence which requires state action to protect those harmed by domestic abuse. It argues that the state has an obligation to protect its citizens from torture, inhuman & degrading treatment & this obligation is heightened in respect of vulnerable adults & particularly children. Further, correctly understood, rights to respect for private & family life, rather than being a barrier to state intervention can be seen as justifying it. References.

The Role of Perceptions in Dating Violence among Young Adolescents

Author: Prospero, Moises11 Graduate School Social Work, U Houston

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61384087?accountid=14925

Abstract: The high prevalence of dating violence & the severity of its aftermath warrant the collaboration between research & practice for the development of prevention & intervention programs. This study investigates young adolescents' perceptions of dating partner's behaviors in common dating situations & their behavioral reaction to these dating situations. Initially, focus groups provided responses used for the development of a dating violence questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of dating scenarios related to perceptions & expected behaviors of the characters in the scenarios. Second, another sample of adolescents responded to the scenarios. Descriptive statistics found that boys & girls reported fewer aggressive perceptions than aggressive behavioral responses to the dating scenarios. Nonparametric statistics revealed that adolescent boys were significantly more likely to expect aggressive responses than girls. These findings have implications for practitioners charged with preventing dating violence. Tables, Appendixes, References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2006.]

Definitions of and Beliefs About Wife Abuse Among Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Men From Israel

Author: Steinmetz, Simona1; Haj-Yahia, Muhammad M1 Israel Ministry of Social Affairs

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809346660?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents a study conducted among 148 men from the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Israel. A self-administered questionnaire was utilized to examine their definitions of and beliefs about wife abuse. The definitions provided by the majority of the participants were highly consistent with definitions that are accepted in the professional literature. The majority of participants tended to view wife abuse as unjustified and held violent husbands responsible for their behavior. They were also in favor of helping women who were abused. At the same time, however, some participants showed a tendency to blame women for violence against them and indicated that the reasons why women stay with husbands who are abusive can be attributed more to external factors than to her internal situation. Substantial amounts of the variance in the participants' definitions of and beliefs about wife abuse can be explained by the extent of their patriarchal ideology. Limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed.

'Talking to My Mum': Developing Communication between Mothers and Children in the Aftermath of Domestic Violence

Author: Humphreys, Cathy1; Mullender, Audrey; Thiara, Ravi; Skamballis, Agnes1 Centre Study Safety & Well-Being, School Health & Social Studies, U Warwick, Coventry, UK cathy.humphreys@warwick.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61399526?accountid=14925

Abstract: Summary: Domestic violence often directly & indirectly undermines the relationship between mothers & their children. This paper describes 'the tactics of abuse' that are instrumental in this damaging process & draws on previous research by one of the authors which shows that a conspiracy of silence can ensue, precluding talk of the abuse that women & children have experienced. The first stage of a four-year action research process designed to address some of these issues is discussed. Findings: Early findings show that those women & children living in refuges or using outreach services who chose to work together on activities have found the process beneficial. They have provided critical feedback about how the project & activities can be revised for the second action research cycle. The research also shows that not all women are ready to engage in this process when they enter a refuge, & it does require them to acknowledge that their children have been exposed to, & negatively affected by, domestic violence. Applications: The implications for social workers & specifically the need to provide active support for the mother-child relationship in the aftermath of domestic violence are discussed. References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61298130?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article evaluates the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary social work & law curriculum for domestic violence. A pretest-posttest control group design with both law & social work students indicates that the course effectively increased: (1) knowledge about domestic violence theory & practice & differential roles, duties, & privileges of lawyers & social workers, & (2) positive attitudes about interdisciplinary work; & reduced (3) myths & stereotypes about domestic violence. Implications for interdisciplinary teaching & domestic violence services are discussed. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Defining Child Exposure to Domestic Violence as Neglect: Minnesota's Difficult Experience

Author: Edleson, Jeffrey L1; Gassman-Pines, Jenny; Hill, Marissa B1 School Social Work, U Minnesota, St. Paul jedleson@umn.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61384965?accountid=14925

Abstract: Policymakers are increasingly focusing on children exposed to domestic violence. The 1999 Minnesota legislature amended the definition of child neglect to include a childs exposure to family violence. What was initially seen as a simple change to bring more attention to children exposed to domestic violence resulted in great turmoil across Minnesotas county-run child protection system. Referrals to county child protection agencies expanded rapidly in the months following the law change, & no new state funding was provided to implement the legislation. A coalition of child welfare administrators & battered womens advocates successfully lobbied for the repeal of this change in definition. Many were dissatisfied with both the impact of the legislation & the fact that exposed children & their families were left without badly needed services. This article reconstructs how Minnesotas legislature made this change, its consequences, & the lessons that may be drawn from this experience. References.

Between the Devil and the Deep-Blue Sea: Conceptualising Victims' Experiences of Policing in Domestic Violence in the Singaporean Context

Author: Ganapathy, Narayanan11 Dept Sociology, National U Singapore, Singapore socng@nus.edu.sg

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60005981?accountid=14925

Abstract: In contextualising victims' experiences of policing in domestic violence situations in Singapore, two extreme but interrelated sets of responses have been observed. At one end of the continuum, criminal justice sanctions are strictly contingent upon victim willingness to initiate criminal proceedings against the perpetrator, & at the other, victims' rights, needs & preferences seem to be usurped by the justice system regardless of victims' choice. Neither of these positions takes victims' interests into account. Nor do they stem from an understanding of the sociocultural, economic & structural circumstances in which victims experienced violence, & continued to experience it, long after a police intervention. Data from the research revealed that criminalisation as an ideological & legally practical tool was not only rendered ineffective but irrelevant to the experiences of women in the Singaporean context. Two factors account for this phenomenon. First, the absence of support structures to achieve criminalisation & address victims' needs in the aftermath of criminalisation; second, the authoritative, paternalistic & patriarchal state impedes processes aimed at the empowerment of women victims.

Coping and Violence Exposure as Predictors of Psychological Functioning in Domestic Violence Survivors

Author: Lewis, Carla S1; Griffing, Sascha; Chu, Melissa; Jospitre, Tania; Sage, Robert E; Madry, Lorraine; Primm, Beny J1 Project Hospitality

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60004523?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the differential effects of adult & childhood physical & psychological abuse, abuse-specific coping, & psychological adjustment in battered women seeking emergency shelter. Multivariate regression analyses confirmed the devastating impact of psychological abuse (childhood & concurrent) on battered women's adjustment. The results corroborated prior research suggesting a cumulative vulnerability to psychological victimization in a substantial proportion of residents. Unexpectedly, frequency of physical violence was unrelated to women's distress. The study argues that modes of coping traditionally considered adaptive (e.g., engaged, proactive) may be unsafe for battered women & children. The multifaceted nature of survivors' coping choices is discussed. Tables, References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2006.]

Arresting Developments: Trends in Female Arrests for Domestic Violence and Proposed Explanations

Author: DeLeon-Granados, William1; Wells, William; Binsbacher, Ruffyard1 Criminology/Program/Policy Consultancy, San Rafael, CA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60010702?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article represents an effort to generate more systematic & specified discussion on the topic of unintended consequences in the movement to decrease violence against women. In this case, the consequence is increases in female arrests for domestic violence. This article builds on recent discussions by first using a sample of data to examine felony domestic violence arrest rates for men & women. The data support the conclusion that domestic violence arrests of women have increased. Second, the article presents six explanations that are derived from existing literature. Although the authors do not offer empirical tests of these explanations, this presentation can play an important part in better understanding the outcomes of criminal justice policies that are aimed at increasing victim safety.

Help-Seeking and Coping Strategies for Intimate Partner Violence in Rural and Urban Women

Author: Shannon, Lisa1; Logan, T K; Cole, Jennifer; Medley, Karen1 Center Drug & Alcohol Research, U Kentucky, Lexington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61300277?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women experiencing intimate partner violence may use a variety of help-seeking resources & coping strategies. The purpose of this study was to examine rural (n = 378) & urban (n = 379) women's help seeking, coping, & perceptions of the helpfulness of resources used in dealing with partner violence. Overall, results suggest that women from both areas utilized a variety of help-seeking resources & coping strategies in significantly different ways. Urban women used more help-seeking resources than rural women. Urban & rural women used different types of resources. Rural women perceived the justice system services as less helpful than urban women. Coping strategies & help seeking are related, with problem-focused coping associated with the use of more formalized help-seeking resources. Implications for research & practice are discussed.

Domestic Violence Cases Involving Children: Effects of an Evidence-Based Prosecution Approach

Author: Gewirtz, Abigail1; Weidner, Robert R; Miller, Holly; Zehm, Keri1 Dept Psychology, U Minnesota, Minneapolis agewirtz@umn.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61316489?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports findings from the evaluation of a city-county criminal prosecution unit for domestic violence involving children. Data from 446 cases prosecuted in the first 2 years of the Joint Prosecution Unit (JPU) were compared to a matched group of 446 domestic abuse cases prosecuted by both the city & county attorneys' offices in the 2 years prior to inception of the JPU. Results of the comparisons indicated that fewer cases were declined or dismissed by the new unit, & that cases were prosecuted at a significantly more stringent level. Multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated that child & weapon factors were associated with increased likelihood of a more serious (i.e., felony) plea for the new prosecution unit, relative to the comparison group. Results are presented in the context of addressing the difficulties inherent in the prosecution of domestic abuse & in light of the increasing awareness of the detrimental effects of domestic violence on children.

Intimate Partner Violence: Prevalence and Risk Factors for Men in Cape Town, South Africa

Author: Abrahams, Naeemah1; Jewkes, Rachel; Laubscher, Ria; Hoffman, Margaret1 Gender & Health Unit, Medical Research Council, Tygerberg, South Africa naeema.abrahams@mrc.ac.za

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61324931?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the prevalence of & risk factors for intimate partner physical violence against women. Interviews were conducted with a sample of 1,378 men working in Cape Town municipalities. An average of 42.3% (95% CI: 39.6, 44.8) reported physical violence against a partner of the last 10 years, & 8.8% (95% CI: 7.3, 10.3) reported physical violence in the past year. After adjustment for age, occupational group, & race, the factors associated with use of violence against partners of the last 10 years were having no post-school training (OR = 2.10), witnessing parental violence in childhood (OR = 1.87), involvement in fights at work (OR = 2.73) & in communities (OR = 1.54), drug use (OR = 1.99), problem alcohol use (OR = 1.98), perceiving hitting women to be acceptable (OR = 4.54), frequent conflict (OR = 2.40), women's alcohol use (OR = 2.25), conflict about sex (OR = 2.16), & conflict about his infidelity (OR = 2.81). The study shows that ideas supportive of gender inequality & normative use of violence in different settings are major underlying factors for men's violence against partners.

Depression, PTSD, and Comorbidity Related to Intimate Partner Violence in Civilian and Military Women

Author: O'Campo, Patricia; Kub, Joan; Woods, Anne; Garza, Mary; Jones, Alison Snow; Gielen, Andrea C; Dienemann, Jacqueline; Campbell, Jacquelyn

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61418095?accountid=14925

Abstract: The mental health consequences for women who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV), such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and especially their comorbidity, have received little attention in large-scale studies and treatment protocols for affected populations. We compared the association of PTSD, MDD, and PTSD/MDD comorbidity to IPV in two large cohorts, one of military and the other of civilian women. The adjusted prevalence of mental health symptoms, especially PTSD, was higher among abused than nonabused women in both samples. Mental health symptoms were also higher among the civilian sample compared to the military sample. Approximately one-third (34%) of the abused civilian women and one-fourth (25%) of the abused military women had symptoms that met criteria for at least one of the three diagnostic categories employed in this study, compared to 18% and 15% of nonabused women in the two groups. Comorbidity of PTSD and depression affected 19.7% of the civilian abused women versus 4.5% of nonabused civilian women, whereas for active duty military women, the prevalence was 4.6% and 4.2% for abused and nonabused, respectively. To better understand the mental health consequences of IPV and to design the most effective treatment and prevention programs, it is important to examine the presence of comorbidities between mental health disorders.

Abstract: This article presents the results of a qualitative analysis on strategies to encourage innovative collaborative practices, & the difficulties these pose, among various groups of practitioners involved with families experiencing domestic violence & child maltreatment simultaneously. The sociology of innovation provides the theoretical framework of this study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 71 practitioners in the fields of domestic violence & child protection. Among the issues raised during the interviews were questions about the day-to-day legal & material operations of organizations, concerns about power plays among various groups of actors, & suggestions to re-examine the perspective from which practitioners envisage the problem & develop solutions. Proposed strategies include: learning to know the other actors better, identifying effective communication mechanisms, involving family members & ensuring their interests are a priority, focusing on the common interests of all the actors, adopting attitudes allowing for the reduction of inequalities of power, & sensitizing practitioners more to this dual problem.

Reproductive Health and Domestic Violence: Are the Poorest Women Uniquely Disadvantaged?

Author: Kishor, Sunita; Johnson, Kiersten

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60037942?accountid=14925

Abstract: We use Demographic & Health Survey data from Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, & Haiti to compare women in different poverty & violence categories in terms of their experience of selected reproductive health outcomes. "Poor" women are those who belong to the bottom quintile of households arrayed according to a widely accepted asset-based wealth index. The results suggest that women who are both poor & have experienced violence are not unique in their reproductive health disadvantage. In particular, for all three reproductive health outcomes we consider, the negative association with having experienced violence cuts across all women, poor & wealthy. Tables, Appendixes, References.

Patterns Of Intimate Partner Violence Among Drug Using Women

Author: Duke, Michael1; Teng, Wei; Clair, Scott; Saleheen, Hassan; Choice, Pamela; Singer, Merrill1 Prevention Research Center

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61724680?accountid=14925

Abstract: Following from growing concern with the role of violence in intimate relationships, this paper examines the relationship between partner violence dynamics and illicit drug use among women in Hartford, CT. Based on an interview sample of 497 street-recruited, not-in-treatment, drug-involved women, the paper compares drug use and health risk among women in four types of relationships: 1) those without self-reported violence; 2) those in which there is violence targeted at a female partner; 3) those in which the violence is perpetrated by the female partner; and 4) those in which there is bi-directional or mutual violence. Findings suggest that drug treatment programs that serve women should therapeutically address the issue of intimate partner violence. Adapted from the source document.

A Child-Centered Approach to High-Conflict and Domestic-Violence Families: Differential Assessment and Interventions

Author: Johnston, Janet R11 Justice Studies Department, San Jose State University, California

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/886774223?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper discusses the extent of violence in high-conflict litigating families, differentiating between abusive relationships and high-conflict divorce, and describing the numerous ways that parenting is deficient and compromised. Guidelines for making access plans that minimise adverse effects on children, restrains further abuse, and protects parents who have been victimised is followed by a discussion of the specialised services needed, and the challenges in coordinating the efforts of family court and community agencies on behalf of these families.

Barriers in Screening Women for Domestic Violence: A Survey of Social Workers, Family Practitioners, and Obstetrician-Gynecologists

Author: Tower, Leslie E11 Divisions Social Work & Public Administration, Eberly Coll Arts & Sciences, West Virginia U, Morgantown letower@mail.wvu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389391?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence (DV) is a pervasive & serious threat to women's lives & well-being. Medical social workers, family practitioners, & obstetrician-gynecologists are in key positions to screen & offer help. Florida NASW members & board certified family practitioners & obstetrician-gynecologists were mailed a psychometrically tested scale. A total of 388 surveys were analyzed. Education (especially the number of in-service hours) & the presence of institutional supports, decreased barriers to screening, increased screening behaviors, & lead to increased victim identification. Only 20.8% of participants always or nearly always routinely screened for DV; 24.0% reported that routine screening did not apply to their role. Self-Efficacy was the strongest predictor of screening behavior with Fear of Offending, Safety Concerns, CEUs/CMEs, & in-service hours contributing approximately equally to the prediction of screening behavior.

A Cross-Cultural Assessment of Posttrauma Reactions among Malaysian and US Women Reporting Partner Abuse

Author: Phillips, Kathryn E1; Rosen, Gerald M; Zoellner, Lori A; Feeny, Norah C1 Center Prevention & Health Services, National Business Group Health, Washington, DC phillips@businessgrouphealth.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61643436?accountid=14925

Abstract: Information on partner abuse in women from non-Western cultures & resulting psychological morbidity are scant. The present study examined these issues among women who experienced partner violence & sought refuge at a domestic violence shelter in Malaysia. These women completed a semi-structured interview & standardized measures to assess posttrauma morbidity. Responses by Malaysian shelter residents were compared with a sample of US women who also reported partner violence. The majority of women in both samples reported severe levels of distress & met criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These findings suggest that psychological problems that women face after partner abuse may be similar in many respects, despite political, geographical, or cultural differences. References.

Relationship between Two Types of Help Seeking Behavior in Domestic Violence Victims

Author: Hollenshead, Jean H1; Dai, Yong; Ragsdale, Mary Katherine; Massey, Erin; Scott, Rachel1 Dept Psychology, One University Place, Shreveport, LA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61396533?accountid=14925

Abstract: A coordinated community response system to the help-seeking behaviors of domestic violence victims is critical to minimize the impact of violent events & to educate the public, so that safe & effective conflict management skills may replace violent responses. The focus for the present study is to identify & analyze victims' choices of law enforcement assistance in stopping the violence &/or aid through the services of the regional family violence center. Some victims select legal channels of support; others rely exclusively on social service support, & others seek assistance from both sources. Characteristics of victims whose cases followed two types of help-seeking behavior patterns -- legal support or social support -- were determined through archived data from both the records of a regional family violence center (FVC) (n=258) & domestic violence incident reports of a police department serving a city of approximately 200,000 citizens (n=127). Findings indicate that African American victims more frequently sought protection through law enforcement sources than they did through family violence center services, & the reverse was true for Euro-Americans.

Support for Emergency Department Screening for Intimate Partner Violence Depends on Perceived Risk

Author: Witting, Michael D; Furuno, Jon P; Hirshon, Jon Mark; Krugman, Scott D; Perisse, Andre RS; Limcangco, Rhona

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809347980?accountid=14925

Abstract: Emergency department (ED) screening for intimate partner violence (IPV) faces logistic difficulties and has uncertain efficacy. We surveyed 146 ED visitors and 108 ED care providers to compare their support for ED IPV screening in three hypothetical scenarios of varying IPV risk. Visitor support for screening was 5 times higher for the high-risk (86%) than for the low-risk (17%) scenario. Providers showed significantly more support for the need for ED IPV screening than visitors. Controlling for confounding by gender, race, experience with IPV, hospital, and marital status did not affect comparisons between groups. These responses indicate greater support for IPV screening in the ED for high-risk than for low-risk cases, particularly among visitors.

A Lifetime of Intimate Partner Violence: Coping Strategies of Older Women

Author: Zink, Therese1; Jacobson, C Jeff, Jr; Pabst, Stephanie; Regan, Saundra; Fisher, Bonnie S1 Dept Research Olmstead Medical Center, Rochester, MN tzink@olmmed.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60000046?accountid=14925

Abstract: Little is known about how older women cope in long-term abusive intimate relationships. Understanding their coping strategies may give insight into how to further support their effective coping efforts. Interviews were conducted with 38 women older than age 55 years. Grounded theory analysis demonstrated that women who remained in their abusive relationships employed mainly cognitive (emotion-focused) strategies to find meaning in a situation that was perceived as unchangeable. By reappraising themselves, their spouses, & their relationships they refocused energies in certain roles, set limits with their abusers, & reached out to others (friends, family, & community organizations). Some women appeared to thrive, others merely survived, but all maintained the appearance of conjugal unity. Tables, Figures, References.

Pushing Back the Boundaries: Social Policy, Domestic Violence and Women's Organisations in Peru

Author: Boesten, Jelke11 Centre International Development, U Bradford

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60000100?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article looks at the extent to which Peruvian women have been able to use a legal & institutional framework designed to combat domestic violence, despite its significant defects, in order to transform the authoritarian forms of communication that prevail in their families, organisations, & communities. Using in-depth interviews with women in Lima, Huancavelica & Ayacucho, the article suggests that while democratisation from above may often result in limited transformations in many policy areas, we must be attentive to the way in which democratisation can be appropriated, transformed & reinvigorated from below. Adapted from the source document.

Freedom of Association: Battering Ram or Trojan Horse?

Author: Caraway, Teri L11 Dept Political Science, U Minnesota, Twin Cities

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60006798?accountid=14925

Abstract: Integrating core labour standards (CLS) into the operations of the Bretton Woods institutions & the WTO has become a primary goal of the international labour movement. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) & the ILO have persuaded the IMF & the Bank to accept CLS, including freedom of association & collective bargaining. Since they can impose painful sanctions on violators, incorporating labour rights enforcement into the international organizations that regulate the international economy has great appeal for the labour movement. I argue that there are potential dangers in this effort. The ILO's understanding of freedom of association is distinctly liberal & promotes the formation of 'free' as opposed to powerful trade unions. In this liberal conceptualization, many labour regulations that enhance labour's power by limiting union fragmentation & increasing bargaining power are considered to be violations of freedom of association. In practice this has meant that the ILO makes policy recommendations that encourage union competition & that discourage centralized collective bargaining. Although framed in different language, these policies mesh well with the agenda of the Bretton Woods institutions. An analysis of Indonesia & Argentina shows how the ILO's understanding of freedom of association has mixed consequences for the strength of the labour movement. References.

The Phenomenology of Meditation for Female Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Kane, Kathleen E11 WholeHealth Initiative, Oasis Women's Counseling Center, Birmingham, AL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61375527?accountid=14925

Abstract: An existential-phenomenological methodology was utilized to investigate the experience of meditation for female survivors of intimate partner violence. Six coresearchers were taught a form of concentrative meditation & were asked to meditate daily & to attend a weekly group meditation for 6 weeks. Semistructured interviews were utilized to gather the data. The essence of the experience that was revealed was the emergence of a centered awareness that is distinctly different from the usual mode of being in the world. Findings suggest the value of meditation as an intervention strategy with survivors & demonstrate the need for further research in this area. Tables, References.

Domestic Violence and Children with Disabilities: Working towards Enhancing Social Work Practice

Author: Baldry, Eileen1; Bratel, Joan; Breckenridge, Jan1 School Social Work, U New South Wales, Sydney, Australia e.baldry@unsw.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61403005?accountid=14925

Abstract: Globally, domestic violence, where a family member, partner or ex-partner attempts to physically, sexually or psychologically dominate or harm the other, is now recognised as one of the most entrenched & pervasive forms of violence in society. Nevertheless, internationally & in Australia, the occurrence of domestic & other forms of violence in families affecting children with a disability is poorly understood. The present article examines the information available on domestic violence & children with a disability. Through the use of case studies drawn from a large disability organisation in New South Wales, Australia, practice issues with families where domestic violence affects a child with a disability are drawn out for social workers to consider. These considerations are designed to enhance practice in this field. References. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Child Maltreatment: Understanding Intra- and Intergenerational Connections

Author: Renner, Lynette M1; Slack, Kristen Shook1 c/o Slack -- Instit Research Poverty, U Wisconsin, Madison

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61605661?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to assess the extent to which intimate partner violence & different forms of child maltreatment occur within & across childhood & adulthood for a high-risk group of women. Low-income adult women were interviewed, retrospectively, regarding their experiences with intimate partner violence & child maltreatment in childhood & adulthood, & intra- & intergenerational relationships between multiple forms of family violence were identified. Analyses demonstrated weak to moderate associations between various forms of violence within generations. Only weak support was found for the transmission of violence hypothesis that maltreated children are more likely to grow up to maltreat their own children. Stronger support was found for the theory of learned helplessness, whereby children maltreated or witness to violence during childhood are more likely to be victimized as an adult. The results from this study suggest that interventions with children who are identified for one form of victimization should be assessed for other forms of victimization, & interventions should also address learned behaviors or beliefs associated with continued or future victimization.

Predicting Case Outcomes and Women's Perceptions of the Legal System's Response to Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault: Does Interaction Between Community Agencies Matter?

Author: Zweig, Janine M1; Burt, Martha R1 Justice Policy Center, The Urban Institute

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61411139?accountid=14925

Abstract: The goals of the current study were to assess if domestic violence and sexual assault case outcomes and women's perceptions of legal system response can be predicted by the level of interaction between community agencies and the level of legal system response after communities receive STOP funding. A total 1,509 interviews were conducted with women living in 26 communities. Two samples were included: (a) a Help Seeker sample recruited from nonprofit victim service agencies and their legal system agency partners, and (b) a Community sample of women ages 18 to 35 recruited through random digit dialing of households. Results show that women's perceptions of whether community agencies were working together to assist her and her case significantly and positively related to arrests in domestic violence and sexual assault cases and to convictions in domestic violence cases. It also increases women's beliefs that law enforcement and prosecution are effective agencies. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2006.]

Alcohol and Intimate Partner Violence: Do We Have Enough Information to Act?

Author: Gil-Gonzalez, D1; Vives-Cases, C; Alvarez-Dardet, C; Latour-Perez, J1 Area Medicina Preventiva & Salud Publica, Dpto Enfermeria Comunitaria/Medicina Preventiva/Salud Publica Historia Ciencia, Edificio Ciencias Sociales, U Alicante, Spain

Abstract: Background: Male alcohol consumption is one of the accepted risk factors for intimate partner violence. The aim of this study is to assess the magnitude of the association between male alcohol consumption & intimate partner violence against women & the quality of the evidence of published papers exploring this relationship empirically. Methods: Systematic review & meta-analysis of quantitative studies (1966-2004). Eight databases from Social & Behavioural Sciences, Clinical Medicine, & Life Sciences were reviewed. Studies with available 2 x 2 table or odds ratio were analysed using meta-analytic techniques. Results: A total of 22 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the systematic review: 14 (63.6%) were cross-sectional studies, 6 (27.3%) case-series, 2 (9.1%) case-control studies. Ten studies analysed the relationship between alcohol & violence as their primary hypothesis & only two used a direct measure of alcohol consumption. Of them, 11 papers were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled odds ratio was 4.57 (95% confidence limits 3.30-6.35), but a high degree of heterogeneity was observed. The magnitude of the effect was inversely associated with the year of publication. The biggest odds ratios were obtained in the studies with the smallest sample sizes. Conclusions: The evidence about the relationship between alcohol consumption & intimate partner violence is of low quality in the study designs & maybe biased by publication of positive results. Currently there is not enough empirical evidence to support preventive policies based on male alcohol consumption as a risk factor in the particular case of intimate partner violence.

Do Laws Restricting Access To Firearms By Domestic Violence Offenders Prevent Intimate Partner Homicide?

Author: Vigdor, Elizabeth Richardson1; Mercy, James A1 Sanford Institute of Public Policy, Duke University, P. O. Box 90312, Durham, NC 27708 Tel: 919-613-9264, Fax: 919-681-8288 evigdor@pps.duke.edu

Abstract: Domestic violence imposes a large cost on society. The authors exploit state variation in timing to examine the impact of three types of law on intimate partner homicides. These laws restrict access to firearms by individuals who are subject to a restraining order or have been convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor or allow law enforcement officers to confiscate firearms at a domestic violence scene. The authors find that female intimate partner homicide rates decline 7% after a state passes a restraining order law. They find no effect from the domestic violence misdemeanor or confiscation laws.

Using Grounded Theory to Generate a Theoretical Understanding of the Effects of Child Custody Policy on Women's Health Promotion in the Context of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Wuest, Judith1; Ford-Gilboe, Marilyn; Merritt-Gray, Marilyn; Lemire, Shannon1 Faculty of Nursing, University of New Brunswick, P.O. Box 4400, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, E3B 5A3 E-mail: wuest@unb.ca

Abstract: Women's health is frequently influenced by social and structural factors, largely beyond women's control, and often entrenched in public policy. Although health is acknowledged to be socially determined, the ways that social conditions affect health are rarely explicated. Grounded theory is a useful method for discovering how structural conditions influence patterns of behavior. We used grounded theory to generate a theoretical understanding of how justice system policy and services related to child custody influence health promotion processes of women and their children after leaving abusive male partners/fathers. In two diverse Canadian provinces, we interviewed single mothers who had left abusive partners as well as frontline workers and policymakers in the justice system. We identified the key dimensions of policy and services that influence the ways in which women and their children promote their health in the context of varying levels of ongoing intrusion as information, eligibility, accessibility, timeliness, human resources, safety, and diversity. In this article, the interplay between theses policy and service dimensions and women's health promotion after leaving abusive partners is discussed and suggestions are made for strengthening "healthy" custody policy. Adapted from the source document.

Dating Violence Among College Men and Women. Evaluation of a Theoretical Model

Author: Luthra, Rohini1; Gidycz, Christine A1 Boston Medical Center

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809321001?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study empirically evaluates the Riggs and O'Leary (1989) model of dating violence. A sample of 200 college students completes assessments concerning the occurrence of violence in their dating relationships. The incidence of self-reported partner violence is 25% for women and 10% for men. Multivariate logistic regression analyses are performed to determine the most salient predictors of dating violence for each gender. Findings reveal that the model is more accurate in predicting female, as compared with male perpetration of dating violence. The model accurately classifies 83% of violent women and only 30% of violent men. This study has several implications for the field of dating violence. Results indicate that although there is some degree of overlap, variant constructs predict violence for each gender. Identifying these constructs will guide prevention efforts in more effectively decreasing the occurrence of dating violence.

A Prospective Analysis of the Relationship Between Childhood Sexual Victimization and Perpetration of Dating Violence and Sexual Assault in Adulthood

Author: Loh, Catherine1; Gidycz, Christine A1 Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Centers, San Diego, CA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809267610?accountid=14925

Abstract: The majority of studies evaluating the relationship between childhood sexual assault and subsequent sexual assault perpetration by men have been conducted retrospectively and with incarcerated populations. The present study seeks to improve on previous research by prospectively investigating the relationship between childhood sexual assault and subsequent perpetration of dating violence in adulthood in men. Although there is a significant relationship between childhood sexual abuse and history of sexual assault perpetration at baseline, prospective analyses indicate that childhood sexual assault is not predictive of perpetration during the follow-up period. The role of family factors, including parental conflict resolution, is implicated in subsequent sexual aggression. These results are supportive of the idea that the effects of childhood sexual abuse may be mediated by a variety of factors.

Persistence of Intimate Partner Violence among Families Referred to Child Welfare

Author: Conelly, Cynthia D1; Hazen, Andrea L; Coben, Jeffrey H; Kelleher, Kelly J; Barth, Richard P; Landsverk, John A1 Child & Adolescent Services Research Center, Children's Hospital & Health Center, San Diego, CA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61375949?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to examine the longitudinal course of intimate partner violence (IPV) among female caregivers of children receiving child welfare services. Data are derived from the National Survey of Child & Adolescent Well-Being, a national probability study of children investigated for child abuse & neglect in the United States. Caregivers (n = 861) are interviewed about demographic characteristics, mental health, substance use, & physical violence by a partner at the close of the investigation & at an 18-month follow-up. Polychotomous logistic regression examines the associations of severe & minor IPV controlling for caregiver & environmental characteristics. The results suggest that factors related to initial risk for IPV do not affect the continuation of IPV & that patterns of IPV differ for racial & ethnic groups. Tables, Figures, References.

Representations of Body and Violence: The Making of "Domestic Violence" in East-Timor

Author: Simiao, Daniel Schroeter11 UFMG dssimiao@uol.com.br

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60312171?accountid=14925

Abstract: East Timor is now faced to a strong social & political change, which implies, on gender issues, the building of a new morality about domestic physical aggression. Based on the local translation of gender equality principles -- seen as universal values -- a set of actions against domestic violence is questioning local practices & attitudes regarding representations of body, gender & sexuality, such as polygamy, the obligations to childbirth & the responsibilities on contraception. Based on one year fieldwork in the country, this paper discusses the way the knowledge of experts on the field of gender & development reflects upon political projects which contribute to the shaping of a specific way of experiencing the body, inscribing physical punishment into a new universe of meanings, many of them considerably different from those in force at the countryside. Conflicts & syntheses emerged from this process show the importance of being aware of the relationship of the building of local identities faced to broader political & symbolic disputes as well as the limits of the binding of local practices & values thought as universal ones.

Domestic Violence and Contraceptive Adoption in Uttar Pradesh, India

Author: Stephenson, Rob1; Koenig, Michael A; Ahmed, Saifuddin1 Hubert Dept Global Health, Rollins School Public Health, Emory U, Atlanta, GA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60043138?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the association between domestic violence & the subsequent adoption of modern contraception in North India. Matched data on married couples who were not practicing contraception are analyzed from companion surveys of married husbands & wives in five districts of Uttar Pradesh. By means of hazard modeling, a significant negative association was found between a husband's reporting of using physical domestic violence against his wife & the couple's adoption of a modern method of contraception. Community norms that were more tolerant of domestic violence were, in contrast, not a significant predictor of subsequent method adoption. The results highlight the need to address the issue of support for women experiencing domestic violence within existing family planning services & to sensitize service providers to the specific needs of women experiencing such violence.

Who Listens? The Voices of Domestic Violence Survivors in Service Provision in the United Kingdom

Author: Hague, Gill1; Mullender, Audrey1 School Policy Studies, U Bristol, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60010851?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article discusses, in the context of the United Kingdom, service user participation in domestic violence services & how much the voices of domestic violence survivors are heard in policy & service development. If services addressing domestic violence are to continue to develop & to effectively meet abused women's needs, then the views of those using them need to be heeded & acted on. In the UK, these views have been mainly overlooked in the past. Now, however, as in some other countries, domestic violence survivor participation has been addressed to a small extent. This article discusses some of the pioneering techniques being tried out & the sensitivity & difficulties involved, within a context of an understanding of empowerment & the activist movement against gender violence. The article considers the participation of UK women experiencing violence in both shelter & advocacy services, in wider interagency forums & in policy development. References.

A Qualitative Exploration of the Nature of Domestic Violence in Pregnancy

Author: Bacchus, Loraine1; Mezey, Gill; Bewley, Susan1 Florence Nightingale School Nursing & Midwifery, Kings Coll London, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61376356?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents a small, qualitative study of 16 women who had experienced domestic violence in the previous 12 months. The violence was perpetrated by a current or former partner in all but one case. Ten of the 16 women had experienced domestic violence during their recent pregnancy, of whom four women had also been assaulted in at least one previous pregnancy. Three women had been assaulted by their partners in a previous pregnancy but not during their recent pregnancy, & three had experienced domestic violence outside of pregnancy only. Some women reported increased feelings of insecurity, jealousy, & possessiveness in their partner during their pregnancy. Abuse within the relationship centered around the arrival & care of the new baby: financial worries, the woman's lessening physical & emotional availability during pregnancy, the lack of practical & emotional support from the male partner, & doubts about paternity.

Modeling Prosecutors' Charging Decisions in Domestic Violence Cases

Author: Worrall, John L; Ross, Jay W; McCord, Eric S

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811975187?accountid=14925

Abstract: Relatively little research explaining prosecutors'charging decisions in criminal cases is available. Even less has focused on charging decisions in domestic violence cases. Past studies have also relied on restrictive definitions of domestic violence, notablycases with male offenders and female victims, and they have not considered prosecutors'decisions to pursue misdemeanor instead of felony charges-or vice versa. In response to these limitations, the authors collected data on prosecutors'charging decisions in 245 domestic violence cases filed by police officers in a Southern California city. They then examined the effects of victim, offender, and case characteristics on prosecutors' charging decisions. The authors found that (a) arrest and serious victim injuries were associated with prosecutors'charging decisions, (b) criminal charges were more likely in cases with male suspects, and (c) victim preference for prosecution was likely to result in felony rather than misdemeanor charges.

Welfare Workers' Responses to Domestic Violence Cases: The Effects of Training and Worker Characteristics

Author: Saunders, Daniel G1; Holter, Mark C; Pahl, Lisa C; Tolman, Richard M1 School Social Work, U Michigan, Ann Arbor

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61379362?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study evaluated a one-day domestic violence training for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) workers & analyzed the relationship between worker characteristics & the use of work exemptions. In a post-only evaluation, trained workers reported a greater tendency than untrained workers to refer clients to couples counseling, make a safety plan, & file a report to child protection services. In a pre/post evaluation, workers reported after training that they would be less likely to refer clients to couples counseling, & more likely to ask about the emotional & physical impact of abuse, make a safety plan, & ask about access to weapons. Workers most likely to offer a waiver from work requirements reported a higher likelihood of making referrals for a variety of services. Tables, Appendixes, References.

The Politics of Place: Practice, Process, and Kinship in Domestic Violence Courts

Author: Lazarus-Black, Mindie1; McCall, Patricia L1 Dept Criminal Justice & Affiliate, U Illinois, Chicago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60054926?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes the processing of domestic violence cases in Trinidad, with implications for the implementation of domestic violence law more generally in other common law courts, including the U.S. It is based on fieldwork in magistrate's courts & a statistical analysis of domestic violence court records-the first of its kind for the English-speaking Caribbean. We identify a "politics of place" that makes courts "discordant locales" (Frohmann 2004), places in which persons requesting protection orders will encounter different forms of structural, practical, & ideological resistance to their claims to rights. We explore the extent to which applications for protection orders are dismissed, withdrawn, or awarded protective action, uncovering differences in case dispositions between the courts. Our analysis highlights the architecture, organization, & workloads of the courts, contrasting judicial styles, & the role of kinship ideology & practice in shaping litigants' use of the courts. We reveal a "public secret" (Taussig 1999) about domestic violence litigation of theoretical & practical interest to anthropologists, scholars & activists concerned with domestic violence, & students of law & society research.

Mental health in women experiencing intimate partner violence as the efficiency goal of social welfare functions

Author: von Eye, Alexander1; Anne Bogat, G.1 Michigan State University, East Lansing

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61384037?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article, we propose that psychological goal functions, such as mental health, as well as income are important elements of social welfare. We examine the relationship between income, depression, social welfare (food stamps and Medicaid) and intimate partner violence, using a person-orientation in a sample from the United States. Data from four time points of a longitudinal study of intimate partner violence are analysed. Clusters of women are derived based on whether or not they received or did not receive food stamps and Medicaid at each of the four time periods. These clusters differ on income and intimate partner violence as well as the trajectory of depression. However, a series of linear models suggests that only intimate partner violence (not income and social welfare variables) predict the development and level of depression over time. The effects of the social welfare variables we examined seem to be domain specific and do not influence the mental health of women receiving these services. Tables, Figures, 1, References.

Abstract: The effects of anger feelings (rated by the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory) & witnessing family violence on anxiety & depression (rated by the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale) were examined in 457 junior high school students. Anxiety & depression scores were correlated with frequencies of witnessing family violence. In a regression analysis, however, after controlling for the demographic variables & depression score, the anxiety score was predicted by State Anger, Anger-Out, & Anger-Control; the depression score was predicted, after controlling for the demographic & anxiety score, by State Anger, Anger-In positively, & by Anger-Out & Anger-Control negatively. Witnessing family violence failed to add significant contribution in predicting anxiety or depression. These results were generally supported by structural equation modeling. The effects of witnessing family violence on dysphoric mood may be mediated by anger feelings. The style of dysphoric mood may be predicted by the style of anger expression.

Exposure to Interpersonal Violence As a Predictor of PTSD Symptomatology in Domestic Violence Survivors

Author: Griffing, Sascha1; Lewis, Carla S; Chu, Melissa; Sage, Robert E; Madry, Lorraine; Primm, Beny J1 Urban Resource Instit

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60010811?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the interrelationships between childhood abuse, exposure to maternal domestic violence, & posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology in a multiethnic sample of 111 adult female residents of a domestic violence (DV) shelter. Participants completed structured interviews about the DV & their prior violence exposure, as well as the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. As hypothesized, there was high co-occurrence between exposure to maternal DV & childhood physical & sexual abuse, & the frequency of lifetime violence exposure predicted PTSD symptomatology. A series of multiple regressions indicated a more complex pattern of relationships, in which specific forms of prior violence exposure predicted different PTSD symptom dimensions. A history of witnessing maternal DV predicted intrusion symptoms, & a history of childhood sexual abuse predicted hyperarousal symptoms. Ethnicity was not related to levels of violence exposure or to PTSD symptoms. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed. Tables, References.

Intimate Partner Violence, PTSD, and Adverse Health Outcomes

Author: Dutton, Mary Ann1; Green, Bonnie L; Kaltman, Stacey I; Roesch, Darren M; Zeffiro, Thomas A; Krause, Elizabeth D1 Dept Psychiatry, Georgetown U Medical Center

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60005615?accountid=14925

Abstract: The high prevalence of adverse health outcomes related to intimate partner violence (IPV) is well documented. Yet we know little about the pathways that lead to adverse health outcomes. Research concerning the psychological, biological, neurological, behavioral, & physiological alterations following exposure to IPV -- many of which are associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) -- represents a promising area of empirical discovery. New technologies & interdisciplinary collaborative efforts are required to integrate diverse methodologies & to apply new findings to improving the health & well being of those affected by IPV. This article focuses on victimization by IPV & addresses the most important research findings in the last 20 years (health & mental health burden of IPV), the most important research issue for the next decade (pathways between IPV & adverse health outcomes), & the most promising methodological innovation for the study of IPV (integrated, interdisciplinary, biobehavioral methodology).

Author: Murray, Christine E11 Department of Counseling and Educational Development, University of North Carolina, Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27402 E-mail: cemurray@uncg.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61392755?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article discusses the controversies surrounding the use of family systems theory as a framework for understanding family violence. The author examines potential implications for the exclusion of family systems approaches in the research and treatment of family violence. In addition, the author describes several opportunities that may arise through the application of family systems theory to family violence for theory, practice, and research.

A Coordinated Community Response to Intimate Partner Violence on the College Campus

Author: Holtfreter, Kristy1; Boyd, Jennifer1 College of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61416055?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recent statistics indicate that intimate partner violence is magnified on college campuses. In the university setting, victims of intimate partner violence may encounter numerous agencies (e.g., campus police, local courts, victim advocates) following reporting of victimization. The need for a coordinated community response to intimate partner violence of college students has been emphasized in recent years, yet little research has been conducted. This qualitative, exploratory study examines perceptions of 15 service providers in a recently implemented, campus-based, coordinated community response. Narrative data from semistructured interviews indicate that service providers are generally satisfied with the current response, but report a need for increased training and resources. Implications for future research, education, and public policy are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Alcohol and Domestic Violence: Women's Views

Author: Galvani, Sarah11 U Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60009090?accountid=14925

Abstract: Alcohol's role in men's violence to women is a controversial issue. In the United Kingdom, little research has been conducted on the link between the two, & no in-depth studies have sought the views of the women who suffer such violence. This article reports on in-depth research with 20 women that aimed to hear their views on the role of alcohol in men's violence to them. The results of the research show that women do not blame alcohol for their partner's violence; they hold the men, not their alcohol consumption, responsible for their actions. References.

Ecological Predictors of Traumatic Stress Symptoms in Caucasian and Ethnic Minority Children Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Graham-Bermann, Sandra A1; DeVoe, Ellen R; Mattis, Jacqueline S; Lynch, Shannon; Thomas, Shirley A1 U Michigan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60036556?accountid=14925

Abstract: Traumatic stress symptoms were assessed for 218 children ages 5 to 13 following exposure to intimate partner violence: 33% of Caucasian & 17% of minority children were diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder. A risk & protective factors model was used to predict traumatic stress symptoms. For Caucasian children, the best predictors were mothers' mental health & low self-esteem. For minority children, the amount of violence, mothers' low self-esteem, & low income predicted traumatic stress. Social support to the mother, inclusive of friends, relatives, & religion, was a protective element. Implications for assessment & intervention are discussed in light of each group's experiences.

Self-Concept and Dating Violence in 220 Adolescent Girls in the Child Protective System

Author: Collin-Vezina, Delphine1; Hebert, Martine; Manseau, Helene; Blais, Martin; Fernet, Mylene1 Dept sexologie, U Quebec, Montreal collin-vezina.delphine@courrier.uqam.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61385825?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this study was to describe the dating violence experiences in a cohort of adolescent girls in the Child Protective System (CPS), & to assess how these experiences relate to their self-concept. A total of 220 adolescent Canadian girls under care of the CPS completed the Offer self-image questionnaire & the revised conflict tactic scales. Results showed that the majority of these girls have experienced some types of victimization in their dating relationships, the least prevalent form being severe injury (24.4%) & the most being minor psychological aggression (81.5%). Data provided here show that the self-concept of teenagers involved in severe violence that includes injury is especially negative. Girls who sustained severe violence with injuries reported more negative overall views of themselves, more problems regulating their emotional tone, more psychopathological symptoms, & lower vocational & educational goals. Implications for prevention initiatives & treatment interventions are discussed. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Parenting Processes and Dating Violence: The Mediating Role of Self-Esteem in Low- and High-SES Adolescents

Author: Pflieger, Jacqueline C1; Vazsonyi, Alexander T1 c/o Vazsonyi -- Dept Human Development & Family Studies, Auburn U, AL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61618152?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current investigation tested a model in which low self-esteem mediated the effects by parenting processes (monitoring, closeness, & support) on measures of dating violence (victimization, perpetration, attitudes, & perceptions) in a sample of adolescents (n=809; mean age=16.4 years) from both low- & high-socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds. Hierarchical regression analyses provided evidence that low self-esteem partially mediated the link between parenting processes & dating violence, with unique differences observed between low- & high-SES youth. Specifically, in low-SES youth, low self-esteem mediated the relationship between closeness as well as support & dating violence behaviours, while in high-SES youth, it only mediated the relationship between maternal support & dating violence attitudes.

Victim or Offender? Heterogeneity Among Women Arrested for Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Henning, Kris1; Renauer, Brian; Holdford, Robert1 Criminology and Criminal Justice, Portland State University, P.O. Box 751, Portland, OR 97202, USA khenning@pdx.edu

Abstract: Mandatory arrest laws for intimate partner violence (IPV) have increased both the number and proportion of arrests that involve female defendants. Whether these numbers should be as high as they are remains a source of controversy. Most practitioners argue that women are usually arrested for defensive actions used in the face of assaults perpetrated by their spouse/partner. Others believe that these higher arrest rates more accurately reflect the true prevalence of physical aggression perpetrated by women. One way to help clarify this debate is to take a closer look at the women charged with IPV. The present study used self-reported information and criminal justice records on prior aggression to classify 485 women convicted of IPV into four distinct subtypes (i.e., no prior violence, primary victim, primary aggressor, and primary aggressor not identified). Despite the fact that all of these women were arrested for and convicted of IPV, analyses consistently found that few of the women could be considered as the primary aggressor in their relationship. Nor, however, were all of the women classified as primary victims. Methodological issues are discussed as well as the policy, practice, and research implications of this study.

Patterns of Intimate Partner Violence Among Married Women in the Military: Type, Level, Directionality and Consequences

Author: Forgey, Mary Ann1; Badger, Lee1 Graduate School of Social Service, Fordham University, 113 West 60th St., New York, NY 10023, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61623149?accountid=14925

Abstract: While separate evidence exists that married military women have high rates of both intimate partner violence victimization and aggression, little is known about the context of this violence, including the extent to which the violence committed toward and by military women is physical, psychological or sexual, whether the violence is unilateral or bi-directional, and the extent of injury sustained or inflicted. In order to gain a more multi-dimensional understanding of the violence in the lives of military women, this study involved 248 enlisted females who completed a self-report survey about themselves and their spouses' behavior. Results indicate that the majority of violence reported was bi-directional and symmetrical in terms of type and level of severity. However, enlisted females were more than three times as likely to be victims of unilateral severe violence as their male civilian spouses. Demographic factors associated with these patterns of violence were also identified. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence in Extremely Poor Women: Longitudinal Patterns and Risk Markers

Author: Bassuk, Ellen1; Dawson, Ree; Huntington, Nicholas1 The National Center on Family Homelessness, 181 Wells Avenue, Newton, 02459 MA ellen.bassuk@familyhomelessness.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61602286?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite high revalence rates of intimate partner violence in the lives of extremely poor women with dependent children, few studies have investigated the patterns of violence that occur over time, and the characteristics of women that serve as risk markers for partner violence. This paper describes patterns of domestic violence longitudinally and uses multivariate analyses to delineate childhood and adult risk markers for recent intimate partner violence in this population of women. Analyses draw upon a sample of 436 homeless and extremely poor housed mothers receiving welfare, in a mid-sized city in Massachusetts with a large Hispanic population of Puerto Rican descent and relatively fewer Blacks. We found that among women with complete longitudinal data (N = 280), almost two-thirds experienced intimate partner violence at some point during their adult life by the end of study follow-up, and that the abuse before and after the baseline interview was episodic and limited over time. To examine the role of individual women's factors, while controlling for partner characteristics, we used baseline data on women who had been partnered during the past year (N= 336). Among childhood predictors, we found that sexual molestation contributed most significantly to adult intimate partner violence that occurred during the past year prior to the baseline interview. Adult risk markers included inadequate emotional support from non-professionals, poor self-esteem, and a partner with substance abuse problems. Having a partner with poor work history was another independent predictor of recent abuse. Ethnicity did not significantly predict whether women were abused or not during the past year, contrary to other findings reported in the literature. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Edwardsen, Elizabeth A; Morse, Diane

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809428763?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: To determine the educational impact of placing partner violence resource information in a medical setting. Method: A cross-sectional study with a structured interview. Setting: Emergency department (ED) in an urban academic medical center. Participants: adult patients and visitors. Interventions: Educational materials and community resource information. Results: 51 patients and 71 visitors (N = 122) met the inclusion criteria and consented to enrollment during a 2-week study period. Of the participants, 71% were female and 29% were male. Sixty-five (53%) of the participants noticed the literature or cards. Ten (8%) read the materials. Seven (6%) retained a copy of the literature. Nineteen (16%) of the participants acknowledged knowing someone who could benefit from the information. Nine (7%) revealed that some of the information was new to them. Conclusions: Placing intimate partner violence resource pamphlets and cards in a medical setting is one means of educating the community and promoting violence prevention.

Prevalence and Predictors of Dating Violence Among Adolescent Female Victims of Child Sexual Abuse

Author: Cyr, Mireille; McDuff, Pierre; Wright, John

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809427936?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to advance knowledge of dating violence behaviors among adolescent victims of child sexual abuse (CSA), first, by determining the prevalence of psychological and physical dating violence and the reciprocity of violence, and second, by investigating the influence of certain CSA characteristics to dating violence. Respondents included 126 females ages 13 to 17 years. More than 45% reported experiencing some sort of physical violence in their dating relationships. Psychological violence was reciprocal in more than 90% of the cases. Multiple regression analysis revealed a significant contribution of CSA characteristics. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the duration of the sexual abuse and the presence of violence or completed intercourse during the abuse could significantly contribute to dating violence above and beyond other known risk factors. Discussion underscores the need to gain a better understanding of CSA and other risk factors that might influence violent dating behaviors.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61630129?accountid=14925

Abstract: The association between domestic violence & physical health in middle-aged Australian women is investigated via a cross-sectional survey of 14,100 women (45 to 50 years old) who responded to the first Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health survey. After adjustment for demographic & health behavior characteristics & menopause status in multivariate analyses, various physical conditions (allergies or breathing problems, pain or fatigue, bowel problems, vaginal discharge, eyesight & hearing problems, low iron, asthma, bronchitis or emphysema, cervical cancer) were associated with domestic violence. The results highlight the link between health & domestic violence in middle-aged women & underscore the need for health professionals to take a full social history from women presenting with physical symptoms.

Prevalence of Male Intimate Partner Abuse in Vietnam

Author: Nguyen, Tuyen D11 Dept Human Services, California State U, Fullerton

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61573793?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study investigated the prevalence of both current & lifetime physical partner abuse among Vietnamese males who reside in Vietnam. Participants (N = 315) were randomly selected to participate in the study. Participants completed the Vietnamese version of the Conflict Tactics Scale-2. A total of 47% (n = 148) of the sampled participants were identified as current physical abusers & 68% (n = 214) as past abusers. Four of the most common abusive tactics abusers exhibited toward their partner were (a) throwing something at their wife (80%), (b) pushing or shoving their partner (78%), (c) beating up their partner (54%), & (d) twisting their partner's arm or hair (60%).

Social Support among Afro-Trinidadian Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Hadeed, Linda F1; El-Bassel, Nabila1 Faculty Social Sciences, Dept Behavioral Sciences, U West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad & Tobago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61378193?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the types of, availability of, use of, & satisfaction with informal & formal social supports among Afro-Trinidadian women who have experienced intimate partner violence. A total of 17 women participated in a 2-hour, face-to-face interview. The findings suggest that despite male dominance & control, women were able to maintain some contact with family & friends. Although some women felt they had family & friends to turn to, many were dissatisfied with the support. Women also expressed dissatisfaction with legal & social services. References.

Reducing Repeat Victimization among High-Risk Victims of Domestic Violence: The Benefits of a Coordinated Community Response in Cardiff, Wales

Author: Robinson, Amanda L11 Cardiff U, Wales, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61391894?accountid=14925

Abstract: The goal of Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARACs) is to provide a forum for sharing information & taking actions to reduce harm to high-risk domestic violence victims. Interviews with participants & victims, observations, & police data reveal how the MARACs work in practice & also what they can accomplish. Results showed MARACs to be invaluable: Agencies assisted victims more efficiently, primarily through enhanced information sharing. MARACs improve victims' safety because both police & victim data revealed that 6 in 10 victims had not been revictimized. These positive results demonstrate the benefits of a coordinated community response. Tables, References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2006.]

Family Law Proceedings, Domestic Violence and the Impact upon School: A Neglected Area of Research

Author: Eriksson, Maria1; Bruno, Linnea; Nasman, Elisabet1 Department of Sociology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden maria.eriksson@soc.uu.se

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347784366?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this article is to open up a discussion about an unexplored area of children's lives at school. While there has been considerable discussion of issues about child protection and the cooperation between school and social services in that context, studies on the intersection between school and family law proceedings seem virtually non-existent. This is also the case when it comes to family law proceedings and different forms of childhood adversity. Drawing upon previous and ongoing research on family law and domestic violence in Sweden, together with a number of other existing studies on children and domestic violence, this article outlines the potential impact of family law proceedings upon school as well as issues requiring further research exploration. Adapted from the source document.

Losing the Plot? Researching Community Safety Partnership Work against Domestic Violence

Author: Radford, Lorraine1; Gill, Aisha1 Roehampton U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61629235?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article considers the role of feminist community activism & academic research in the context of contemporary crime reduction policy. We draw upon experiences & knowledge gained from our involvement in comprehensive evaluation studies of community responses to domestic violence against women (in two areas of the South East of England) completed in 1996 & in 2004, before & after the present government's crime reduction initiatives. We consider the perils & prospects for academic 'experts' & feminist activists, of the increased emphasis on 'what works' in crime reduction, & the development of new technologies of control, especially in the areas of risk management & performance & monitoring.

Children exposed to domestic violence: Effects of gender and child physical abuse on psychosocial problems

Abstract: This study sought to compare the specific impact on psychological and behavioral problems in children of exposure to domestic violence and of both exposure and physical victimization. These effects are examined also as a function of gender. A community sample of 79 children aged 6-12 years and their mothers were divided into three groups: witness (N = 34), abused/witness (N = 20) and comparison (N = 25). Results showed that children in the two domestic violence groups presented more symptoms and behavioral problems than did the comparison group. The abused/witness children obtained significantly higher scores on 5 of the 9 CBCL scales. Only one gender-specific difference was observed: Girls presented more problems on the delinquent conduct scale. Adapted from the source document.

A Study of Male Veterans' Beliefs toward Domestic Violence in a Batterers Intervention Program

Author: Craig, Mary E1; Robyak, James; Torosian, Elaine J; Hummer, Jon1 Women's Primary Care Clinic, Inpatient Rehab Unit, Veteran Affairs Medical Center, Bay Pines, FL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61573335?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intercultural mediation programs have recently been set up in Catalonia in order to manage growing foreign immigration flows. Intercultural mediators, usually immigrants working for local governmental entities & NGOs & brokering in the relationships between immigrants & their new social, cultural & legal setting, accomplish a very wide variety of roles aimed at facilitating the social inclusion of immigrant groups. This article, moving beyond classic approaches to immigrant acculturation & on the basis of ethnographic fieldwork, examines the activities of intercultural mediators as normative & institutional brokers who bridge the gaps between newcomers & the institutions, professionals & the population at large of the host society, in both conflictual & non-conflictual settings. The article examines how intercultural mediators behave as interfaces or entry points to the legal, normative & institutional systems of the host society, as transmitters & enforcers of legal & social norms, as promoters of welfare services & human rights &, more broadly stated, as mediators between different normative, institutional & cultural backgrounds. Its aim is to understand & make better known the work of these emerging actors, who, facilitating the integration of the newly arrived, provide an insightful example of cross-cultural normative brokering. The analysis of this bridging activity, in turn, provides some insights on the nature of their immigrant integration practices, their management of cross-cultural conflict, the impact of their approach to the laws & norms of the host society & the questionable suitability of the mediation label to describe their interventions.

Public's and Police Officers' Interpretation and Handling of Domestic Violence Cases: Divergent Realities

Author: Stalans, Loretta J1; Finn, Mary A1 Dept Criminal Justice, Loyola U Chicago, IL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61573422?accountid=14925

Abstract: The public's & police officers' interpretation & handling of realistic hypothetical domestic violence cases & their stereotypic views about domestic violence are discussed. A sample of 131 experienced officers, 127 novice officers, & 157 adult laypersons were randomly assigned to read a domestic violence case. Experienced officers were more likely to arrest only the husband than were laypersons or rookie officers even when respondents inferred that the husband was primarily responsible or had used violence before. Experienced officers considered their stereotypic beliefs about battered women's propensity to use self-defense in arriving at their arrest decision whereas laypersons & rookie officers did not. These findings indicate that the public & police officers have not adopted the feminists' message that arrest is the best response to handle all domestic violence cases. Policy implications are discussed. Tables, References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2006.]

Women's Response to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Ruiz-Perez, Isabel1; Mata-Pariente, Nelva; Plazaola-Castano, Juncal1 Research Dept, School Public Health, Granada, Spain isabel.ruiz.easp@juntadeandalucia.es

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61624522?accountid=14925

Abstract: The responses of women to a situation of abuse by their partner has hardly been addressed in the literature. Using a self-administered, anonymous questionnaire, 400 women attending three practices in a primary health care center in Granada (Spain) were studied. The women's response to abuse was used as a dependent variable. Sociodemographics, intensity, duration, & combination of the types of abuse were used as independent variables. Lifetime prevalence of any type of partner abuse was 22.8%. Of abused women, 68% showed an active response, attempting to resolve the situation mainly through separation (58.2%). The factors independently associated with a woman's active response were being separated, widowed, or divorced; reporting a greater intensity of abuse; & being younger than age 35 years. The results of this study show that a large majority of abused women in Spain try to resolve their situation, & that they are not passive victims. Tables, References.

Economic Well-Being and Intimate Partner Violence: New Findings about the Informal Economy

Author: Pyles, Loretta11 School Social Work, Tulane U

Abstract: The purpose of this research was to explore the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) & women's participation in the informal economy (both legal & illegal) & their impact on economic well-being. This research was part of a National Institute of Justice (NIJ) study that was concerned with women's survival of childhood & adult abuse. For the 285 women that were in this sample, there were positive, medium correlations between IPV & various types of informal economic activity. Illegal informal economic activity, institutionalized informal economic activity, incarceration & physical abuse negatively impacted women's economic well-being. Tables, References.

The Influence of Legal Reform on the Probability of Arrest in Domestic Violence Cases

Author: Simpson, Sally S1; Bouffard, Leana Allen; Garner, Joel; Hickman, Laura1 Dept Criminology & Criminal Justice, U Maryland, College Park ssimpson@crim.umd.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61637844?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using domestic violence incidence & arrest data from Maryland (1991-1997), this research examines whether the proportion of incidents that result in arrest increased due to a legislative initiative implemented in 1994 &, if so, whether this change is uniform across different types of offenders (race & gender) & offense characteristics. Using interrupted time-series analysis (ARIMA), we observe an increase in both the number of incidents reported to police & the percent of reported cases resulting in arrest. The legislative intervention has a significant positive impact on arrest likelihood above & beyond the increase over time for the state as a whole. While arrest probabilities increased across the board for males & females, African American & Whites, the ARIMA models do not suggest that the legislation differentially impacted arrest probabilities for these groups.

Working with Asian Perpetrators of Domestic Violence -- The British Experience

Author: Guru, Surinder11 Instit Applied Social Studies, U Birmingham, Edgbaston s.guru@bham.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61398810?accountid=14925

Abstract: Close work with male perpetrators of domestic violence has never found a comfortable compromise within feminist perspectives & strategies to tackle violence against women. However, interventions with perpetrators within mainstream white discourses have addressed this side of the coin whilst providing some level of safety to women & children. In Britain, such strategies have not, as yet, been explored in relation to men from ethnic minorities since other more serious issues of race & gender oppression have demanded the immediate attention of practitioners & researchers. This article explores the need for engaging in work with men in a culturally sensitive manner, with a view to reducing male aggression against women & children. References.

Domestic Violence and the Abuse of Pets: Researching the Link and Its Implications in Ireland

Author: Allen, Mary1; Gallagher, Barbara; Jones, Boyd1 School Applied Science, University Coll Dublin, Ireland mary.allen@ucd.ie

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61391722?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper reports on a small study which investigates the connection between domestic violence & non-accidental injury in animals in the Republic of Ireland. This found that many women reported witnessing one or more forms of abuse, or threats of abuse, of their pets. Most women considered that a place to accommodate pets would have made their decision to leave the family home easier. Four women disclosed that lack of such a service & concern for the welfare of their companion animals caused them to remain in their abusive relationships for longer than they felt appropriate. The majority of women felt unable to talk to anyone about their fears for their pets' welfare & there is no service which can provide temporary accommodation for women's pets while they are in a refuge. These findings support those found elsewhere in larger studies in the US & UK, & demonstrate a high incidence of animal abuse in households where there is reported domestic violence. The implications for social work education & practice of the issue of violence against women are discussed. Tables, Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence against Married Women in Cambodia

Author: Yount, Kathryn M1; Carrera, Jennifer S1 Emory U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61650529?accountid=14925

Abstract: We evaluate the effects of marital resources and early-life experiences on recent domestic violence and attitudes about wife abuse among 2,074 married Cambodian women. Household standard of living was negatively associated with physical domestic violence. Women with 8-13 fewer years of schooling than their husbands more often experienced physical and psychological domestic violence. Women with more living children more often experienced physical domestic violence and justified wife beating. Having surviving parents and siblings was not associated with domestic violence nor with attitudes about wife beating. Women reporting higher paternal schooling, urban childhood residence and domestic violence against their mothers had higher odds of experiencing physical and psychological domestic violence. Findings underscore the effects of marital resources and early-life experiences on domestic violence in Cambodia. Adapted from the source document.

The Process of Change for Victims of Intimate Partner Violence: Support for a Psychosocial Readiness Model

Author: Cluss, Patricia A1; Chang, Judy C; Hawker, Lynn; Scholle, Sarah Hudson; Dado, Diane; Buranosky, Raquel; Godlstrohm, Sheri1 Dept Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Instit & Clinic, U Pittsburgh, PA clusspa@upmc.edu

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization is a women's health problem that imposes a significant health & health care cost burden. Although IPV victims cannot change the perpetrator's behavior, they can take actions to reduce exposure to the partner's abuse. The process of change for IPV victims has been described using the transtheoretical model (TTM), among others. We report results of a qualitative study with current & past IPV victims to 1) explicate the process of safety-seeking behavior change for female victims of IPV & 2) explore the fit of the TTM for explaining this process. Based on the results, we propose the psychosocial readiness model to describe the process of change for female victims of IPV. This model considers readiness as a continuum that ranges from robustly defending the status quo on 1 end to being ready to take action toward change on the other. Movement toward & away from change along the continuum results from a dynamic interplay of both internal factors & external interpersonal & situational factors. Tables, Figures, References.

Spiritual and Religious Abuse: Expanding What Is Known about Domestic Violence

Author: Bent-Goodley, Tricia B1; Fowler, Dawnovise N1 School Social Work, Howard U, Washington, DC tbent-goodley@howard.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61369938?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence reportedly affects more than 5 million Americans each year, more than 85% of whom are women. Many of these women turn to their faith-based communities for support & guidance, but little is known about how the church members they turn to perceive or understand domestic violence. This article reports the outcomes of three focus groups in three diverse communities of faith in the African American community that resulted in a better understanding of how church leaders & congregants view spirituality & religion & how they converge with domestic violence. Implications for research & practice are presented for domestic violence intervention. References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2006.]

Female Caregivers' Reflections on Ethical Decision-Making: The Intersection of Domestic Violence and Elder Care

Author: Koenig, Terry L1; Rinfrette, Elaine S; Lutz, Wendy A1 School Social Welfare, U Kansas, Lawrence tkoenig@ku.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61383880?accountid=14925

Abstract: As our population ages, increasing numbers of social workers & other therapists will provide counseling to women who are caregivers of frail elders. These female caregivers often face complex ethical dilemmas in caring for a frail elder. Furthermore, these dilemmas are compounded by domestic violence in the caregiver/frail elder relationship initiated before the onset of caregiving. Illustrated with case examples, this article presents an ethical decision-making model based on an empowerment framework for helping practitioners work with caregivers who face difficult dilemmas impacted by domestic violence. Implications for strengthening clinical practice with these caregivers are discussed. References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This study explored factors associated with a lifetime history of domestic violence and sexual assault in a sample of welfare recipients in Illinois. Results indicate that childhood exposure to domestic violence is a risk factor for both sexual assault and domestic violence victimization, but that childhood physical abuse is only a risk factor for domestic violence. Increased education and employment skills and having more children were also risk factors for domestic violence victimization. Domestic violence was significantly associated with depression, while sexual assault was associated with low social support and a greater perceived need for mental health services. Frequent alcohol and drug use were not associated with either type of victimization. Research implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Police Response to Victims of Domestic and Non-Domestic Violence

Author: Sun, Wan Y11 University of Delaware, Newark, DE

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61655117?accountid=14925

Abstract: The research assesses whether police respond differently to victims of domestic and non-domestic interpersonal conflicts. Though many laws and policies have been introduced since the 1980s to enhance police responses to and protection of victims of domestic violence, very few studies have empirically examined police assistance or support toward victims of both domestic and non-domestic conflicts. Using data collected by a large-scale observational project, this research analyzes officer-initiated assistances and police responses to victim requests during conflict resolution. Findings show that police are more likely to provide assistances on their own initiative to victims of domestic violence than victims of non-domestic violence. Police, however, do not differ significantly in their responses to requests made by victims of domestic and non-domestic conflicts. Implications for policy and future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Diversity: A Call for Multicultural Services

Author: Sumter, Melvina11 Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61640164?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence is a pervasive problem in virtually all countries, cultures, ethnic and racial groups, and social classes. A review of the literature indicates that in the vast scholarship on violence against women in intimate relationships, minimal attention has been given to experiences of ethnic minorities. Consequently, although there have been significant gains in providing criminal justice and social services initiatives to victims of domestic violence, many victims of intimate violence who are ethnic minorities underutilize the interventions and services available in part because their help-seeking behaviors differ from those of the dominant culture. As such, this paper provides an overview of some of the cultural barriers that may hinder the effectiveness as well as limit the amount of intervention and social services available for some of the most vulnerable victims of intimate violence. This paper concludes with recommendations that agencies as well as individual service providers can employ to increase their multicultural competency. Adapted from the source document.

Child Maltreatment and Domestic Violence: Human Services Issues

Author: Appel, Jonathan K1; Kim-Appel, Dohee1 Old Dominion University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61396389?accountid=14925

Abstract: A significant number of family violence cases involve what are called co-occurring cases of violence. What this means is that if a child is being maltreated, there is a high likelihood that domestic violence is also occurring between the parents. When these cases occur, several different human services systems may get involved. This paper examines the concept of co-occurring violence and addresses the fragmented response system. Suggestions for improving the response to co-occurring violence are provided. Adapted from the source document.

The Prevalence and Characteristics of Intimate Partner Violence in a Community Study of Chinese American Women

Author: Hicks, Madelyn Hsiao-Rei11 University of London

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809555965?accountid=14925

Abstract: A community probability-sampled survey was done of 181 Chinese American women to investigate the prevalence and nature of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Chinese Americans. Of participants, 42% knew a Chinese woman who had experienced IPV. Also, 14% had experienced IPV themselves in their lifetime (8% severe and 6% minor), 3% in the previous year, and 2% currently. In Chinese American women who were ever married, the lifetime prevalence of IPV was 17%. IPV resulted in physical injuries for 31% of women and affected their work and education. Exploratory analysis suggests that relationship problems and partner's alcohol use may be risk factors for IPV in this group.

A Psychometric Typology of U.K. Domestic Violence Offenders

Author: Johnson, Rebecca1; Gilchrist, Elizabeth; Beech, Anthony R; Weston, Samantha; Takriti, Rachel; Freeman, Richard1 University of Birmingham

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809462033?accountid=14925

Abstract: A number of studies have described subtypes of domestically violent men, and the heterogeneity of domestically violent men is well established. The aim of the current study was to investigate the distribution of subtypes using psychometric measures in convicted domestically violent offenders in England. Four subtypes of offenders were identified: low pathology, borderline, narcissistic, and antisocial. These subtypes were broadly comparable with the family-only, dysphoric/borderline, and generally violent/antisocial types proposed by Holtzworth-Munroe and Stuart. The majority of the sample (60%) best fit the generally violent/antisocial profile. However, the reliance on psychometric measurement and lack of corroborative evidence from partners means that further research is necessary to test these findings.

Severity of Intimate Partner Violence and Occurrence and Frequency of Police Calls

Author: Bonomi, Amy E1; Holt, Victoria L; Martin, Diane P; Thompson, Robert S1 Center Health Studies, Group Health Cooperative, & Harborview Injury Prevention & Research Center, Seattle, WA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61358220?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article evaluates whether female victims of severe physical, psychological, or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) call police more often than other abused women. Abused women (431) reported frequency of contacting police (dependent variable), nature & severity of IPV experienced, & characteristics of themselves & their perpetrator (explanatory variables). A two-part regression model estimated likelihood of police contact among all participants & rate of contact among callers. Women with severe physical or psychological IPV or injury were more likely to call police than were other abused women. Among callers, women made 96% more calls if a weapon was involved, 58% more if they were severely sexually abused, & 40% more if they were severely physically abused. Women with children at home made 32% more calls. These results delineate the level & types of IPV & other characteristics of homes that make single & repeat calls to police. Tables, References.

Police Attitudes toward Domestic Violence Offenders

Author: Logan, T K1; Shannon, Lisa; Walker, Robert1 Dept Behavioral Science, U Kentucky

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388424?accountid=14925

Abstract: Police attitudes are important in facilitating a sense of safety & comfort in women seeking justice-system support for protection from partner violence. This study examined police attitudes toward sanctions & treatment for domestic violence offenders compared with other violent & nonviolent offenders. In addition, police attitudes toward domestic violence offenders who do & do not use substances were examined. Officers from one city police department (n = 315) participated in a survey. Results indicate there is a trend toward attitudes that treatment, rather than sanctions, was more appropriate for domestic violence offenders. In addition, officers rated the use of sanctions higher for domestic violence offenders who abuse alcohol or drugs compared with domestic violence offenders who did not abuse alcohol or drugs. Understanding police attitudes toward domestic violence offenders may have implications for police training & victim services in facilitating the use of the justice system in protecting women from partner violence.

The Emergence of Contrasting Domestic Violence Regimes in Post-Communist Europe

Author: Johnson, Janet Elise1; Brunell, Laura1 Dept Political Science, Brooklyn Coll, New York

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61363747?accountid=14925

Abstract: Between the end of socialism & the 2004 European Union enlargement, options for women in Central & Eastern Europe seeking to overcome domestic violence grew noticeably. Because these options include both social movement organisations & the state, we adopt what we call a 'domestic violence regime' approach, comparing 11 countries & exploring four -- Poland, Russia, Slovakia & Armenia -- in more depth. Considering the impact of foreign intervention in encouraging & complicating these reforms, the conclusion draws implications for European policy makers concerned with gender equality.

Abstract: This article explores the types and prevalence of intimate partner violence within one conservative Christian denomination. The article provides an overview of findings from a five-state region in the North Pacific United States. A stratified random sample of seventy churches within the denomination offered data collection venues with a total sample of 1431 respondents. Using anonymous survey methodology, we found that the predominant type of abuse occurring between intimates in this sample was controlling and demeaning behavior. Sixty-five per cent of the respondents confirmed they experienced these behaviors from an intimate at least once in their lifetime. Nearly half the respondents (46%) reported experiencing common couple violence, 29% sexual violence, and 10% severe physical violence. Multiple regression analysis reveals the two strongest indicators that are significantly associated with all types of intimate partner violence include being divorced or separated and having a personal history of childhood abuse. In addition, having a difficult family economic situation and being female were predictors of some type of victimization. Social workers in religious congregations have important work to do in helping victims in need of healing, educating congregants about healthy intimate partner interaction, and preventing child abuse which leads to future relationship vulnerability.

Theological and Practice Issues regarding Domestic Violence: How Can the Black Church Help Victims?

Author: Collins, Wanda Lott1; Moore, Sharon E1 Raymond A. Kent School Social Work, U Louisville, KY wanda.collins@louisville.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61379894?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence in all of its forms is ugly & destructive. It comes from every class, every ethnic group, & every walk of life. It crosses all denominational lines & is a serious problem within the African American community. However, African American pastors & church leaders have generally not held perpetrators accountable & have responded to domestic violence in silence & denial. This sends the message that violence in intimate relationships is acceptable. This paper examines the historical function & role of the black church in the African American community. It highlights how abusive men misapply & distort biblical scriptures to support women staying in unhealthy relationships. Recommendations are included for how social workers & church leaders may effectively unveil & address the silence & denial regarding domestic violence as it relates to African American women.

The Consequences of Witnessing Family Violence on Children and Implications for Family Counselors

Author: Adams, Chritopher M11 Dept Counseling, School, & Educational Psychology, U Buffalo-State U, New York

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61387913?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although a large number of children are directly abused, an even larger number may indirectly experience the effects of abuse as witnesses of family violence. However, the effects on children who witness such violence have long been unaddressed, although a growing body of research indicates that these children are affected in various domains, including their physical or biological functioning, behavior, emotions, cognitive development, & social adjustment. This article summarizes some of the recent literature regarding the effects of witnessing family violence on children's development, addresses the clinical implications of these effects, & offers several recommendations for family counselors who work with children affected by violence within the family.

Intimate Partner Violence: Predictors of Recidivism in a Sample of Arrestees

Author: Kingsnorth, Rodney11 California State U, Sacramento

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61572343?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article seeks to identify the variables that predict intimate partner violence recidivism. Neither prosecutorial actions, such as case rejection or subsequent dismissal, nor judicial imposition of jail terms or placement in a batterer treatment program demonstrated predictive value. Extralegal variables associated with the defendant, such as cohabitation status, marital status, gender, employment, & substance use at the time of the incident, all failed to attain significance. Victim support for arrest & prosecution were also unrelated to revictimization. Conversely, use of a weapon, the offender's prior arrest for any offense, & the presence of a protective order at the time of the precipitating incident all predicted rearrest for intimate violence within an 18-month follow-up period. Policy implications are discussed. Tables, Figures, References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2006.]

Victims of Intimate Partner Violence more Likely to Report Abuse from In-Laws

Author: Raj, Anita1; Livramento, Kai N; Santana, M Christina; Gupta, Jhumka; Silverman, Jay G1 Boston U School Public Health

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61604822?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study of South Asians in the United States was designed to assess quantitatively the association between intimate partner violence (IPV) & emotional abuse by in-laws (n = 169) & to qualitatively identify via in-depth interviews with battered women (n = 23) forms of abuse perpetrated by in-laws. Quantitative findings demonstrate a significant relationship between IPV & abuse from in-laws (odds ratio = 5.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.5-21.5). Qualitative data demonstrate that abuse by in-laws includes emotional abuse (e.g., isolation, social & economic control, & domestic servitude), awareness or support of IPV, & direct physical abuse. Domestic violence interventions with South Asian women must consider abuse from in-laws & IPV experiences. References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2006.]

Intimate Partner Violence, Women, and Work: Coping on the Job

Author: Swanberg, Jennifer E1; Macke, Caroline; Logan, T K1 Coll Social Work, U Kentucky, Lexington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61610980?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence is a significant health problem for women, with consequences extending to work as well as society at large. This article describes workplace interference tactics, how women cope with violence at work, & workplace supports for a sample of recently employed women with domestic violence orders (DVO; n = 518). Results indicate that violent partners used a wide range of work interference tactics, that women were more likely to tell someone at work about the victimization than they were to hide the information, & that coworkers & supervisors provided a range of supports to women who did disclose their situation. Implications for further research & practice are discussed. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Factors Associated with Attitudes toward Intimate Partner Violence: A Study of Women in Zambia

Author: Lawoko, Stephen11 Stockholm Centre Public Health, Karolinska Instit, Stockholm, Sweden stephen.lawoko@sll.se

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61386707?accountid=14925

Abstract: Demographic, social, & empowerment factors associated with attitudes toward intimate partner violence (IPV) were investigated in a random sample of women (n = 5,029) aged 15-49 years in Zambia. Data was retrieved from the Zambia Demographic and Health Survey 2001-2002 (2003). The findings indicated demographic, social, & structural differences in attitudes toward IPV. Married/previously married & less educated women, employees in the agricultural sector, & women with a history of IPV were more likely to tolerate IPV. In addition, structurally disempowered women (i.e., women lacking access to information & autonomy in household decisions) were more likely to justify IPV than more-empowered peers. Most variables remained significant even when possible confounding was adjusted for using a logistic regression. The findings are discussed & implications for prevention as well as methodological issues considered. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

An Integrated Relapse Prevention and Relationship Safety Intervention for Women on Methadone: Testing Short-Term Effects on Intimate Partner Violence and Substance Use

Author: Gilbert, Louisa1; El-Bassel, Nabila; Manuel, Jennifer; Wu, Elwin; Go, Hyun; Golder, Seana; Seewald, Randy; Sanders, Glorice1 Columbia U, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61628437?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study tests the feasibility, safety, & short-term preliminary effects of a relapse prevention & relationship safety (RPRS) intervention in reducing drug use & the experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) among women on methadone. For this randomized controlled trial, 34 women who met IPV & drug use criteria were randomly assigned to either the RPRS condition (n = 16) or a one-session informational control (IC) condition (n = 18). RPRS participants were more likely than IC participants to report a decrease in minor physical or sexual IPV (OR = 7.1, p = .05), minor psychological IPV (OR = 5.3, p = .03) & severe psychological IPV (OR = 6.07, p = .03) at the 3- month follow-up. Data suggest that RPRS participants were also more likely than IC participants to report a decrease in any drug use at 3 months (OR = 3.3, p = .08). This study provides preliminary evidence that the RPRS intervention is effective in reducing IPV & drug use among women on methadone. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Preliminary Findings from an Outcome Evaluation of an Intimate Partner Violence Prevention Program for Adjudicated, African American, Adolescent Males

Author: Salazar, Laura F1; Cook, Sarah L1 Rollins School Public Health/Behavioral Sciences/Health Education, Emory U, Atlanta, GA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61635245?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study evaluated the efficacy of a five-session intimate partner violence (IPV) prevention program for adjudicated African American male adolescents. The program was guided by feminist theory & was culturally focused & gender specific. An experimental design was used to assess changes in knowledge of IPV & patriarchal attitudes at posttest & to test for the moderating effects of committing IPV & witnessing parental IPV. Results indicated higher levels of knowledge & less patriarchal attitudes among the intervention group as compared to the control group. Committing violence was not a significant moderator of intervention effectiveness; a witnessing parental violence by group interaction revealed that adolescents in the intervention group had significantly lower patriarchal attitudes compared with adolescents in the control group, but only for those who witnessed high levels of parental male-to-female violence.

Intimate Partner Violence and the Workplace. Consequences and Disclosure

Author: Swanberg, Jennifer E; Macke, Caroline

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811224937?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the context and consequences associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) when it traverses the workplace. It reports the findings of a study of 34 employees in one workplace pertaining to the prevalence of recent IPV, the consequences of batterers' actions on employees' work performance, the context associated with the disclosure of IPV in the workplace, the types of workplace supports that were received, and the effects of supports on employment outcomes. Implications for social work practice are discussed.

Dilemmas of Healthcare Providers towards Domestic Violence in Mexico

Author: Herrera, Cristina1; Agoff, Carolina1 c/o Agoff -- Centro Regional Investigaciones Multidisciplinarias, U Nacional Autonoma Mexico, Los Reyes, Coyoacan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919905280?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study of 30 physicians & nurses from the Mexican public health system aimed to understand their concepts & practices concerning domestic violence. A recent survey showed that most health professionals were unaware of the official criteria & procedures for dealing with cases of domestic violence. Our in-depth interviews failed to show substantial differences between professionals according to level of care, & that treatment was generally inadequate. We also observed a repertoire of ingrained social meanings among the medical staff concerning violence (derived from their own cultural traditions), hindering more effective responses to the problem.

Communities, Care and Domestic Violence

Author: Wilcox, Paula11 School Applied Social Science, U Brighton, Sussex, UK P.S.Wilcox@brighton.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61646858?accountid=14925

Abstract: Whilst there has been a resurgence of interest in community in many fields in the UK this has been singularly missing in relation to domestic violence. Relatively little is known about informal community networks & their responsiveness to survivors of domestic violence & the intersections of these with formal agency networks. This paper argues that (mis)understandings of domestic violence, a focus on agency/state responses & the traditional association of discourses of caring with women have all been important contributory factors here. Drawing on an empirical study on the informal support of survivors in the north of England in the mid 1990s & current research with survivors in the south of England this paper reviews the evidence for arguing that, whilst community-based work against domestic violence raises particularly complex challenges, it is nevertheless essential to explore this as an additional strategy in tackling domestic violence.

Classification Typology and Assessment of Five Levels of Woman Battering

Author: Roberts, Albert R11 Criminal Justice Dept, Rutgers U, Piscataway, NJ prof.albertroberts@comcast.net

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61386988?accountid=14925

Abstract: Family violence is a prevalent, dangerous, and often life-threatening social and public health problem. It is an indiscriminating crime that knows few boundaries, as recent annual estimates indicate that over 8.7 million women are battered by husbands, boyfriends, and other intimate partners [Roberts, 2002; Roberts & Roberts, 2005]. This article examines a new five-level classificatory schema or typology detailing the duration and severity of woman battering. Five hundred and one battered women completed in-depth interviews which formed the basis for a new classification typology ranging from short-term to chronic to homicidal levels. The current research on different types of battering relationships provides clinicians and forensic specialists with psychosocial indicators that can be utilized as a basis for early intervention and prevention of lethal consequences. The concept of the unknown prevalence of women abuse, or the "dark figure," is also addressed in this article. Additionally, practical suggestions are made for implementing crisis intervention protocols. Adapted from the source document.

Cognitive-Affective Predictors of Women's Readiness to End Domestic Violence Relationships

Author: Shurman, Lauren A1; Rodriguez, Christina M1 University of Utah

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809327786?accountid=14925

Abstract: A model of women's readiness to terminate an abusive relationship was examined, using cognitive and emotional factors to predict readiness to change as conceptualized in the transtheoretical model. Factors previously identified in the domestic violence literature were selected to represent cognitive predictors (attribution and attachment style) and affective predictors (depression, hopelessness, anxiety, and anger) of readiness to end a domestic violence relationship. Responses by 85 female victims of intimate partner violence indicated that their overall readiness to terminate a relationship was predicted by a preoccupied attachment style and high emotional arousal. However, women's low level of anger predicted their precontemplation of change, the earliest stage of readiness, whereas internalizing emotional difficulties and preoccupation with their batterer predicted maintenance, the final stage of readiness to persist in their decision to leave their abuser. Implications of these findings for working with women considering leaving their partner are discussed.

Characteristics of Victims Coarrested for Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Houry, Debra1; Reddy, Sudha; Parramore, Constance1 Emory University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809327774?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study evaluated the frequency of coarrest in female victims who utilized 911 for intimate partner violence (IPV) and any patterns or circumstances that increased the likelihood of coarrest. All cases of police-documented IPV where a female IPV victim was arrested in conjunction with the perpetrator were included. Each incident report was reviewed to determine demographic characteristics of the victim, weapon and substance involvement, presence of children, and violence severity. Of IPV victims, 9% (131 of 1,489) were arrested. Having a weapon, alcohol use, not being married, and older age were associated with increased likelihood of arrest (p < .001). The presence of a child decreased the likelihood of victim arrest (p < .001). Race, prior incidents of IPV, offender restraining order, and incident severity were not significantly associated with coarrest. Although coarrest occurred in a minority of cases, it may deter victims from contacting police for future incidents of police.

Factors Influencing Help-Seeking from Informal Networks among African American Victims of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Morrison, Katherine E1; Luchok, Kathryn J; Richter, Donna L; Parra-Medina, Deborah1 Wellesley Centers

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61383975?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of the challenges African-American women in abusive relationships face when they consider seeking-help from their informal networks. Data are reported from interviews with 15 African-American women who were self-identified as having survived physical intimate partner violence. A 13-item, semi-structured interview guide was developed in order to elicit information from participants. All of the interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, & coded for analysis. This analysis revealed emergent themes from these interviews concerning the social factors & perceptions that influence help-seeking behavior. Participants perceived their informal networks as willing to offer instrumental support. However, informal networks were not emotionally supportive. Participants also noted that the African-American community at-large believes victims of violence to be 'stupid' for remaining in violent relationships. Additional results are also discussed. Results may be used to help enhance efforts to reduce the rates of intimate partner violence among African-Americans. Tables, References.

Conflict and Control: Gender Symmetry and Asymmetry in Domestic Violence

Author: Johnson, Michael P11 Pennsylvania State U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389602?accountid=14925

Abstract: Four types of individual partner violence are identified based on the dyadic control context of the violence. In intimate terrorism, the individual is violent & controlling, the partner is not. In violent resistance, the individual is violent but not controlling; the partner is the violent & controlling one. In situational couple violence, although the individual is violent, neither the individual nor the partner is violent & controlling. In mutual violent control, the individual & the partner are violent & controlling. Evidence is presented that situational couple violence dominates in general surveys, intimate terrorism & violent resistance dominate in agency samples, & this is the source of differences across studies with respect to the gender symmetry of partner violence. An argument is made that if we want to understand partner violence, intervene effectively in individual cases, or make useful policy recommendations, we must make these distinctions in our research.

Utilizing Program Evaluation as a Strategy to Promote Community Change: Evaluation of a Comprehensive, Community-Based, Family Violence Initiative

Author: Kaufman, Joy S1; Crusto, Cindy A; Quan, Michael; Ross, Ellen; Friedman, Stacey R; O'Rielly, Kim; Call, Stephanie1 Division Prevention & Community Research & Consultation Center, Yale U School Medicine, New Haven, CT joy.kaufman@yale.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61364250?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper describes the authors' work in a community that received Federal funding for an integrated system of care to reduce the impact and incidence of exposure to violence for children less than six years of age. The paper includes a review of the conceptual framework that guided the work of the authors and provides a brief overview of the issue of family violence, the impact of this violence on young children, and the Federal response to this issue. In addition, a description of the Initiative and the community in which it was based is provided along with some aspects of the evaluation plan. Finally, the authors discuss how their work with this Initiative depicts an approach to facilitating change within communities. Adapted from the source document.

Children and Domestic Violence: A System of Safety in Clinical Practice

Author: Cooley, Belinda1; Frazer, Craig1 E-mail: belinda.cooley@sesiahs.health.nsw.gov.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61366843?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present paper provides a framework for working with children and families where there are domestic violence and child protection concerns. A model of practice developed by the St George Domestic Violence Counselling Service and the St George Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service in the South East Sydney and Illawarra Health Service (NSW Australia) is outlined. The present paper includes a discussion on a recently developed service agreement between the two services and a case study focusing on a 'system of safety' when working with children. The present paper focuses on the effects of domestic violence on women and children by male perpetrators. We do not ignore that men may be victims of domestic violence, however, the authors recognise the gendered nature of domestic violence and the significant number of women and children who experience and live with domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence of Rural Aging Women

Author: Teaster, Pamela B1; Roberto, Karen A; Dugar, Tyler A1 306 Wethington Health Sciences Building, 900 S Limestone, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536-0200 E-mail: pteaster@uky.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61417802?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although reports of intimate partner violence (IPV) decrease with age, a significant number of aging women experience IPV in their relationships. The structure and culture of rural environments may inadvertently conceal violence against aging women and inhibit prevention and treatment efforts. Guided by an ecological community framework, 3 focus groups involving 24 professionals working with victims of IPV in rural Kentucky and in-depth interviews with 10 aging rural women who had experienced IPV were conducted to examine the trajectory of, and community responses to, violence in late life. Findings revealed multiple interacting influences on IPV of aging women in rural areas including the women's families and resources, culture and locality, religion, community support, and government entities.

"Hitting is Not Manly": Domestic Violence Court and the Re-Imagination of the Patriarchal State

Author: Mirchandani, Rekha11 Bowling Green State U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61632247?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this study, the author investigates how the battered women's movement has transformed the treatment of domestic violence in Salt Lake City's specialized domestic violence court. Using Lisa Brush's account of how the state promotes the dominance of men & the disadvantage of women, the author shows that Salt Lake City's domestic violence court transforms both its governance of gender & its gender of governance, lending support to optimistic theories of the state. The author argues that this court is an example of a state institution that has been transformed into a feminist regime committed to individual & social change. The author encourages feminist theorists to engage with the work of Jurgen Habermas to better conceptualize the potentially positive relations among the state, social movements, & social change.

The Operational Policing of Domestic Violence in Singapore: An Exploratory Study

Author: Ganapathy, Narayanan11 Department of Sociology, National University of Singapore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61684814?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the formal processing of domestic violence as accomplished by institutionalized policing in Singapore. The description of the process through which domestic calls for assistance were shaped and translated into relevant categories for appropriating a particular police response was facilitated through the use of the participant observation method. The ethnographic fieldwork reported here, including observations of call screening in action, is an attempt to explicate the phenomenological grounds employed by organizational members to constitute calls as instances of categories for practical policing purposes. Theoretically, the data point to the need for a reconceptualization of the problem of policing domestic violence by emphasizing the point that the eventual institutional response be understood as a product of the relationship that exists between police subculture and structural conditions of policing unique to contemporary Singapore society.

Judicial Monitoring of Compliance: Introducing 'Problem Solving' Approaches to Domestic Violence Courts in England and Wales

Author: Burton, Mandy11 U Leicester, UK mdbl5@le.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61637261?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the development of specialist domestic violence courts. It overviews the features of 'problem solving' courts and considers the extent to which the fledgling domestic violence courts in England and Wales are adopting the problem solving approaches found in some specialist courts in the United States of America. Whilst noting some of the successes of the first seven domestic violence courts in England and Wales, the article concludes that more effective interventions in domestic violence cases can be achieved through greater involvement of the judiciary in ongoing monitoring of the defendant's compliance with court ordered perpetrator programmes. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence. Linguistic Features and Accommodation Behavior of Perpetrators and Victims

Author: Robertson, Kirsten; Murachver, Tamar

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809422921?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study compared the communication behavior of individuals with and without histories of intimate partner violence (IPV). Specifically, the authors examined participants' use of and accommodation toward facilitative and nonfacilitative language features as a function of their abuse histories. The findings revealed that perpetrators and victims of IPV used fewer facilitative and polite language features. Additionally, men with histories of IPV were more likely to use nonfacilitative language features. The examination of accommodation behavior revealed that perpetrators of psychological abuse were more likely to accommodate toward nonfacilitative language features and were less likely to accommodate toward facilitative language features. In all other instances, participants modified their speech toward the manipulated styles. In light of these findings, recommendations are made for IPV treatment initiatives.

Abstract: This article overviews the findings of a domestic violence and disability study undertaken in 2005. The study was sponsored by Middlesbrough Domestic Violence Forum and funded by the Neighbourhood Support Fund, Middlesbrough, as one way of taking forward their equal opportunities commitments to this group of women, in the wake of the domestic homicide of a local disabled woman. Although local, it is one of the very few recent UK studies to address this issue, so its findings have national significance. Adapted from the source document.

A Specification of the Types of Intimate Partner Violence Experienced by Women in the General Population

Author: Miller, JoAnn11 Women's Studies Faculty, Purdue U, West Lafayette, IN

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61649692?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study analyzes data from a national, general population sample of respondents (National Violence Against Women Survey) to estimate the prevalence of the different forms of intimate partner violence (IPV) that women experience in the United States. The study's purpose, to differentiate types of IPV, follows the Johnson & Ferraro tradition that distinguishes occasional & random acts of abuse from chronic & controlling forms of violence. When examining the specific types of IPV that the survey respondents disclosed, the author finds that the distribution closely resembles Gordon's epidemiological findings. This study analyzed the variance in the number of types of IPV as a function of the childhood abuse the women experienced & their partner's controlling & threatening behaviors. It concludes with a discussion of the multiple responses to IPV that are necessary in contemporary U.S. society. Tables, Figures, References.

Community Violence and Its Direct, Indirect, and Mediating Effects on Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Raghavan, Chitra1; Mennerich, Amy; Sexton, Ellen; James, Susan E1 John Jay Coll Criminal Justice, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61633616?accountid=14925

Abstract: The links among social disorder, violence in the social support network (NIPV), community violence, & women's substance use were examined in a sample of 50 low-income, nonshelter women to predict intimate partner violence (IPV). The authors found that living in a neighborhood with higher levels of social disorder & using substances increased women's exposure to community violence that, in turn, was associated with increased rates of IPV. In addition, although not associated with community violence, NIPV was associated with increased IPV. The results suggest that examining neighborhood-level factors is important in domestic violence policy, practice, & research. Tables, Figures, References.

"Anything with Two Heads Is a Monster": Religious Leaders' Perspectives on Marital Equality and Domestic Violence

Author: Levitt, Heidi M1; Ware, Kimberly1 U Memphis, TN

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61649927?accountid=14925

Abstract: Religious leaders from Jewish, Christian, & Islamic faiths were interviewed about their understanding of the intersection of intimate partner violence (IPV) & religion. The present article explores the leaders' understanding of how relationship dynamics relate to IPV, focusing particularly on concepts of equality & submission. On the whole, the leaders were concerned that religious prescriptions of disproportionate power, such as the teachings of male leadership & female submission, could be interpreted to support IPV practices. Tensions between leaders' desire to salvage marriages & to protect victims are explored. Tables, Figures, References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2006.]

Black Women's Health: The Effect of Perceived Racism and Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Waltermaurer, Eve1; Watson, Carole-Ann; McNutt, Louise-Anne1 Dept Sociology, New Paltz State U, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61643333?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study provides preliminary evidence of the relationship between perceived racial discrimination & intimate partner violence (IPV) & how these exposures interact to affect the mental & physical health of Black women. The exposures of lifetime perceived racial discrimination & IPV were found to be highly associated. Furthermore, women who reported both exposures showed a notably higher prevalence of anxiety & nonspecific physical health symptoms compared with women who reported either or neither exposure. To appropriately respond to the health needs of Black women, it is essential that women's many stressors be considered simultaneously. Tables, References.

Domestic Violence Beliefs and Perceptions among College Students

Author: Nabors, Erin L1; Dietz, Tracy L; Jasinski, Jana L1 Dept Sociology, U Central Florida, Orlando

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397741?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study builds on current research, investigating the relationships between sociodemographic variables & domestic violence attitudes & beliefs among college students. Data from the Relationship Characteristics Study conducted in 2001, which includes a sample of 1,938 college students, are used to replicate & extend the research of Carlson & Worden (2001, 2005), the developers of the attitudes & beliefs items. In addition, the research portends to analyze factors associated with domestic violence causation endorsement, physical & sexual abuse, stalking, & verbal abuse beliefs, including gender, race & ethnicity, university year, parents' education, family income, parents' marital status, & relationship status. Results are consistent with the rates reported by the item developers. Further, results demonstrate that sociodemographic variables are correlated with physical & sexual abuse & verbal abuse beliefs & causation endorsement. Tables, References.

Prevalence Of Dating Violence And Victimization: Regional And Gender Differences

Author: Marquart, Beverly S1; Nannini, Dawn K; Edwards, Ruth W; Stanley, Linda R; Wayman, Jerfrey C1 Tri-Ethnic Center for Prevention Research, Department of Psychology, Sage Hall, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1876

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61675096?accountid=14925

Abstract: This report examines (1) the prevalence of dating violence victimization from a national sample of rural adolescents and (2) patterns by gender and region. Analyses are based on 20,274 adolescents who reported violence victimization using the Community Drug and Alcohol Survey. The relationship of dating violence with gender and region was assessed with HLM5 using Bernoulli's logistic regression. Approximately 16% of adolescents reported being a victim of dating violence. Females reported higher incidence of victimization than males. Dating violence is more prevalent in the South. While it is important to address the underlying values in society that may contribute to dating violence, it is equally productive to include regional and cultural values. Adapted from the source document.

Making Your Home a Shelter: Electronic Monitoring and Victim Re-entry in Domestic Violence Cases

Author: Erez, Edna1; Ibarra, Peter R1 Department of Justice Studies, 113 Bowman Hall, Kent State University, Kent E-mail: eerez@kent.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61663238?accountid=14925

Abstract: The development of bilateral electronic monitoring (BEM) exemplifies how shifts in the "culture of control" (Garland, 2001), including a focus on domestic violence (DV) victims' emotional welfare and integration into proceedings, can alter abused partners' everyday lives. As a protective strategy, BEM provides DV victims with an alternative to relocating to a shelter. The subjective sense of safety engendered by program involvement emerges gradually, as everyday environments are re-evaluated in light of an estranged partner's absence; through social interactions with family members, friends, and justice agents; and as the understanding of what it means to be "protected" develops. The use of BEM technology to promote victim welfare rather than as a strictly evidentiary tool suggests that this expression of the new paradigm ofjustice is oriented toward victim re-entry into civil society. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence against Women -- Etiology and Legal Regime in India

Author: Singh, Pradeep11 School Law, Banaras Hindu U, Varanasi, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60353317?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence is a major social problem facing the world community, and frequently refers to men's physical, sexual and psychological violence against women. It is not a new emerging offence committed against women, but recently, due to the impact of feminism it has now become hotly debated. Not only municipal regimes, but international legal measures are making an effort to tackle this menace and make the society egalitarian in which there should be no gender violence. For this purpose, the Indian Parliament has passed the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. For proper tackling of the problem, it is necessary to study the causes and the law simultaneously. One can find that the new enactment may also be affected and there may be various hurdles in its implementation viz., women have no willingness to file the case; if filed, to pursue the case; and the problem of retracted testimony. Patriarchal society is set up such that, by filing a case the victim usually loses her reputation and her husband loses nothing. These problems may make the Act of 2005 only a paper tiger. In this situation, to tackle the problem efficiently, the responsibility is fully relying on law enforcement agencies. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic violence and child protection: exploring the role of perpetrator risk assessments

Author: Humphreys, Cathy11 Alfred Felton Chair of Child and Family Welfare, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia cathy.humphreys@unimelb.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61428460?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores the issue of severity in relation to domestic violence and provides a number of reasons for the necessary engagement by workers with such a contentious issue. The specific role that the assessment of the risks posed by the perpetrator which has now developed in some police forces in the United Kingdom is examined, and its relevance to child welfare intervention discussed. A range of factors are identified that heighten the risks of increased violence. These include prior sexual assault; stalking and controlling behaviour; substance misuse and mental-health problems; separation and child contact disputes; pregnancy; escalation including the use of weapons and psychological abuse; attempts and threats to kill; child abuse; isolation and barriers to help-seeking. The ways in which perpetrator risk assessment can be used to inform the filtering of referrals to the statutory child care agency, enhance multi-agency working, provide a structure for the assessment of the perpetrator, enhance partnership-working with survivors (usually women) and inform the protection strategies for workers are explored. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence Screening and Service Acceptance Among Adult Victims in a Dependency Court Setting

Author: Rivers, James E1; Maze, Candice L; Hannah, Stefanie A; Lederman, Cindy S1 Department of Sociology & Anthropology, Florida International University, Miami, Florida

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61421036?accountid=14925

Abstract: Many child welfare systems are unable to effectively identify and address co-occurring domestic violence and child maltreatment. In response, the Dependency Court Intervention Program for Family Violence implemented a protocol to identify indicators of domestic violence in families involved with child protection proceedings. This article highlights data that demonstrate the ability of an outreach and screening process to identify adult victims of domestic violence in dependency court and to offer them appropriate intervention services.

Animals As Disregarded Pawns in Family Violence: Exclusionary Practices of Feminist Based Refuge Policies

Author: Brennan, Sharon11 U Melbourne Sharob@BarwonHealth.org.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61666849?accountid=14925

Abstract: Commonly agreed upon is the relationship between family violence and violence toward nonhuman animals. Workers in the field of family violence also acknowledge that women may delay leaving a violent home due to loyalty to their nonhuman counterparts, and because refuge policies often do not allow them to accompany humans into safe shelter. The recent work of Clifton Flynn has indicated the relationship between nonhuman animals and human animals to be one of responsive interaction, with theoretical analyses most often based upon Goffman's theory of symbolic interaction. Despite literature indicating the level of harm inflicted upon nonhuman family members in violent homes, and requests from women and children that they accompany them to safe shelter, refuge policies often negate the possibility of this occurring. This article critiques the feminist ideals on which refuge policies are based, and in doing so, argues that justice is denied to nonhuman animals. Their existence in the violent home is maintained by lack of choices available to their human counterpart, and is enforced by feminist ideals, which are ironically based upon equity. Unless feminist principles are challenged, nonhuman family members will continue to be denied justice in violent families where escape is the only option to ensure safety. Adapted from the source document.

Training, Co-Training, and Cross-Training of Domestic Violence and Child Welfare Agencies

Abstract: As a result of the frequent co-occurrence of intimate partner violence (IPV) and child maltreatment, national organizations have recommended that child welfare systems (CWS) and domestic violence service (DVS) organizations be trained, co-trained, and cross-trained on IPV and child maltreatment. The objective of this study was to describe the training reported by local CWS and DVS agencies on the topic of co-occurring abuse. Structured telephone interviews were conducted with 73 CWS and 76 DVS agencies. Approximately half of the DVS agencies and two thirds of the CWS agencies achieved less than 50% of the total possible training score. However, several sites demonstrated strong training. Future research should identify additional factors that facilitate or impede the recommended training for CWS and DVS agencies. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence Continuum, Forensic Assessment and Crisis Intervention

Author: Roberts, Albert R11 Interdisciplinary Criminal Justice Program, Rutgers-The State University of New Jersey, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Livingston College Campus, Lucy Stone Hall B-wing, Room 261, Piscataway, NJ 08854 E-mail: prof.albertroberts@comcast.net

Abstract: Domestic violence continues to be one of the most pervasive, traumatic, life-threatening, and harmful family problems in society today. A new 5-level classificatory schema or continuum of the duration and severity of woman battering is proposed for assessment and intervention. The continuum is based on 501 in-depth interviews with battered women in emergency shelters, police departments, and a large state women's prison. The underlying goal of identifying different types of battering relationships is to provide social workers and forensic specialists with psychosocial indicators that can be used as a basis for early case-finding, crisis intervention, and preventive intervention. Crisis intervention protocols and other intervention strategies are needed with abused women throughout North America. Adapted from the source document.

Is peer injecting a form of intimate partner abuse? A qualitative study of the experiences of women drug users

Author: Wright, Nat M J1; Tompkins, Charlotte N E; Sheard, Laura1 HMP Leeds, Centre for Research in Primary Care, University of Leeds, and

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61422355?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women are over-represented as the recipients of injections of illicit drugs and are often injected by their intimate partners. This study used qualitative research to explore women drug users' experiences of abuse from intimate partners when being injected with illicit drugs. In-depth interviews were conducted with 45 women drug users in the city of Leeds and the area of North Nottinghamshire, UK . The practice of peer injecting illicit drugs places women recipients at risk of physical, economic and emotional abuse from their male intimate partner injectors. However, this was not a universal feature. In trusting, supportive intimate partner relationships peer injecting took place through reciprocal arrangements. Moving away from peer injecting was technically and emotionally difficult for women and rarely straightforward. The implications of the work are discussed as clinicians and wider drug service staff should be aware of the possibility of abuse and enquire about peer injecting when consulting with women injecting drug users. However, clinicians should avoid working within a simplistic clinical framework that views all peer injecting as intrinsically abusive. More research is needed to provide evidence for best practice. Until then, generic principles of best practice management of intimate partner abuse could apply, including enhancing women's motivation to effect change in an abusive situation. Adapted from the source document.

Cultural Considerations And Challenges To Service Delivery For Sudanese Victims Of Domestic Violence: Insights From Service Providers And Actors In The Criminal Justice System

Author: Keller, Elizabeth M1; Brennan, Pauline K1 The University of Nebraska at Omaha, Department of Criminal Justice, DSC 208, 6001 Dodge Street, Omaha, NE 68182-0149, USA ekeller@mail.unomaha.edu

Abstract: Omaha, Nebraska has recently seen an influx of immigrant refugees from the African nation of Sudan. Domestic violence service providers worry that many Sudanese women are suffering abuse in silence. With that in mind, we identified a number of common obstacles that immigrant women are likely to face when accessing services for domestic violence. We interviewed victim advocates, criminal justice personnel, and other community-based service providers. Our respondents identified the areas of difficulty they encountered most frequently when working with Sudanese clients. Everyone interviewed agreed that Sudanese cultural norms created barriers to service delivery. Our respondents also discussed the strategies they employed when they provided services to Sudanese women, along with their impressions about how well or how poorly those approaches worked. We present their experiences, their challenges, and their recommendations for the future. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence Help-Seeking Behaviors Of South Asian Battered Women Residing In The United States

Author: Raj, Anita1; Silverman, Jay G1 Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02118, USA anitaraj@bu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61663605?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study was designed to assess domestic violence help-seeking behaviors among battered South Asian women residing in Greater Boston, USA. Prevalence of these behaviors was assessed among South Asian women reporting violence in their current relationship via an anonymous survey (N=44). Forms and qualities of help-seeking behaviors and needs were assessed via in-depth interviews with a separate sample of self-identified battered South Asian women (N=23). Of the surveyed battered women (N=44), 23 (52%) reported no acquisition of support or services assessed; no women reported use of criminal justice services; and only two had contacted a domestic violence program (5%). Qualitative data (N=23) indicate that when help-seeking does occur, it is elicited by increasing severity in violence and/or thoughts of separation from the batterer; it begins with help-seeking within the community, and the community response includes helping link victims with more formal domestic violence services. However, among women attempting to separate from their batterer, resource constraints at the programmatic level and restrictive immigration laws were cited as major hurdles they were facing towards independence. Findings from this study attest to the need for a multi-level approach to support battered South Asian women in the US that goes beyond the current criminal justice model of intervention.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND MANDATORY ARREST LAWS: TO WHAT EXTENT DO THEY INFLUENCE POLICE ARREST DECISIONS?

Author: Hirschel, David; Buzawa, Eve; Pattavina, April; Faggiani, Don

Abstract: Current research on domestic violence indicates that intimate partner violence arrest rates have risen as a direct result of the implementation of mandatory and preferred arrest domestic violence laws. However, this research also suggests that part of this increase can be attributed to an increase in the arrest rate of females in cases of domestic assault. In addition, the arrest of both parties involved in an incident, also known as a 'dual arrest,' appears to have contributed to the rising rates of domestic assault arrest. This study analyzes assault and intimidation data from a calendar year 2000 National Incident Based Reporting System ('NIBRS') dataset that includes information from 2819 police departments in nineteen states. The study examines the differential arrest outcomes in intimate partner and other domestic, acquaintance, and stranger assaults, and the effect that the statutory framework has on the likelihood of arrest, with an added emphasis on female arrests. We found that mandatory and preferred arrest statutes have significant effects on arrest practices for intimate partner as well as other victim-offender relationship categories. The nature of the impact of laws varies depending upon offender and offense characteristics. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT].

The AC-COD Screen: Rapid Detection of People with the Co-Occurring Disorders of Substance Abuse, Mental Illness, Domestic Violence, and Trauma

Abstract: An important SAMHSA initiative that started in 2003 is focusing on improving treatment for people with the co-occurring problems of mental illness and substance abuse. The 2002 national survey found over 23% of adults with a serious mental illness also abused alcohol or other drugs, and 20.4% of adults who abused alcohol or other drugs also had a serious mental illness. To provide more effective treatment for people with a co-occurring disorder, universal screening has been suggested. Objective: The intent of this study was to develop an integrated screen that would help identify people with a possible co-occurring disorder who needed to be fully assessed for a concurrent mental health and substance abuse disorder. Method: The screen consists of 17 common behavioral health questions used in the fields of mental health, addiction, domestic violence, and trauma. The screen was designed to be easy to use and easy to interpret. To pilot test the screen, it was administered to 234 people who called either a mental health or addiction treatment program. Statistical analysis of the screen subscales included Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the items, calculating Cronbach's Alpha (a) coefficients, and a beginning examination of sensitivity and specificity. Results: The data analysis suggests that the three subscales had acceptable internal consistency (MH ? = .70, SA ? = .89, DV ? = .72). Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, the AC-COD Screen although continuing to need further testing has the potential of being a tool that can identify people who have a likelihood of having a concurrent disorder and who should be fully assessed.

Abstract: There has been much research on the effects of domestic violence on women, however, little research has focused on possible differences in reactions to domestic violence between Latina and non-Latina women. Comparable samples of Latina and non-Latina women were obtained and analyses revealed that there were no significant differences between the two samples with regard to the nature and severity of the domestic violence to which they were exposed. However, results indicated that Latina women who had been victims of domestic violence had significantly greater trauma-related symptoms, depression, lower social and personal self-esteem, and were less likely to make global attributions for positive events than were non-Latina women. They also reported more parenting stress due to their child's behaviors than did non-Latina women. The implications of these results in light of cultural differences between Latina and non-Latina women are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Enhancing current explanations of domestic violence exposure effects on child cognitive and behavioral functioning was the purpose of this investigation. Participants were 31 domestic violence exposed and 31 non- exposed children ages 3 to 5 years and their single-parent household mothers. Child-mother pairs were matched for child's age, gender, and ethnicity, mother's age and education, and annual family income. Child cognitive and behavioral functioning was assessed via psychological assessment and parent report. The presence of mental health difficulties in mothers was assessed using self-report and clinician- administered instruments. Exposed children showed lower verbal functioning and higher internalizing behaviors than did their non-exposed peers. Exposed mothers displayed greater psychological difficulties than did their counterparts. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence, Condom Use and HIV Risk for Adolescent Girls: Gaps in the Literature and Future Directions for Research and Intervention

Author: Teitelman, Anne M1; Dichter, Melissa E; Cederbaum, Julie A; Campbell, Jacquelyn C1 University of Pennsylvania, School of Nursing, Center for Health Disparities, 420 Guardian Drive, NEB 223-250, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6096

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61421384?accountid=14925

Abstract: Adolescent girls account for a growing number of new cases of HIV in the United States, primarily transmitted through heterosexual sex. The principal method of HIV prevention for heterosexually-active girls is condom use by their male partners. Most HIV prevention interventions aimed at adolescent girls have focused on promoting the girls' individual behavior change and are most effective in situations that are under girls' control. A growing body of literature indicates the importance of recognizing partner influence on girls' condom use and negotiation strategies, and a beginning recognition of the role that intimate partner violence (IPV) may play in the decision-making control within the dyad. To better understand these linkages, this paper examines the association between IPV and girls' HIV risk through condom non-use with a systematic review of the literature and a theory-informed conceptual background. Six studies with adolescent girls were found that reported an association between intimate partner violence and increased risk for HIV (indicated by condom non-use). Gaps in the literature and implications for future research and prevention strategies are described. Findings highlight the need for more research to further elucidate the mechanisms linking intimate partner violence to condom non-use and to identify common precursors (proximal and/or distal) to explain these often co-occurring health risks. Prevention strategies that address the influence of interpersonal power dynamics and gender norms on sexual decision-making, and also incorporate ways to reduce risk for exposure to abusive relationships, hold promise for increasing effectiveness of HIV prevention interventions for adolescent girls. Such interventions need to be youth-informed and include tailored strategies for at-risk groups. Adapted from the source document.

Predicting the Occurrence of Stalking in Relationships Characterized by Domestic Violence

Author: Melton, Heather C11 University of Utah

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809430272?accountid=14925

Abstract: A high correlation has been found between domestic violence and stalking. However, very few studies have examined what factors predict the occurrence of stalking in relationships characterized by domestic violence. Using in-depth interviews with victims of domestic violence whose cases have gone through the criminal justice system, this article explores this issue. It was found that experiences of stalking by their abusers were very prevalent in this group of domestic violence victims. In terms of predicting stalking, domestic violence victims who were not in a relationship with their abuser, whose abusers had an alcohol or drug problem, who experienced more controlling behaviors by their abusers, and who had experienced prior stalking by their abusers were at the greatest risk of experiencing more severe stalking. Implications for intervention are discussed.

Identifying Pregnant Women Experiencing Domestic Violence in an Urban Emergency Department

Author: Datner, Elizabeth M; Wiebe, Douglas J; Brensinger, Colleen M; Nelson, Deborah B

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809431146?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article describes characteristics of pregnant women presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) who are experiencing current violence and presented a screening tool to identify pregnant women experiencing violence. Women completed an in-person interview regarding violence, sociodemo-graphic factors, health status, and drug use. Fifteen percent of women reported at least one episode of violence during the pregnancy. Young age (OR = 3.37, 95% CI: 1.79-6.36), current alcohol use (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.06-2.19), current marijuana use (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.32-2.92), less than a high school education (OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.01-2.12), and a prior diagnosis of trichomonas (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.20-2.72) were significantly related to experiencing current violence. Screening patients using these five characteristics identified 8 out of 10 women reporting violence (sensitivity = 75.6%). These results identify a set of predictors that may be helpful in identifying pregnant women who are experiencing current domestic violence.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder does not Increase Recurrent Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Sonis, Jeffrey11 Department of Social Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61355179?accountid=14925

Abstract: To determine whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases the risk of recurrent intimate partner violence, I conducted a secondary analysis of longitudinal data from 321 women in the Chicago Women's Health Risk Study. PTSD at baseline showed a moderate unadjusted association with recurrent IPV in the 2-year follow-up period. However, when important confounding factors, such as severity of previous abuse and use of control tactics by the partner, were controlled in a logistic regression model, there was no association between PTSD and recurrent victimization.

A Comparison Study of Coping, Family Problem-Solving and Emotional Status in Victims of Domestic Violence

Author: Clements, Caroline1; Ogle, Richard L1 Department of Psychology, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, NC 28403-5612 clementsc@uncw.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61347922?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence research has been limited by lack of appropriate comparison groups. In the present study, shelter-living, abused women were compared to community-living, abused women, maritally distressed women, and non-distressed non-abused women on relationship characteristics, emotional status, and family problem solving and coping. Shelter-living abused women reported more physical violence in the past year than community-living abused women. Both abused groups reported higher levels of depression and anxiety than non-abused groups. Community-living women reported greater use of aggressive solutions to family problems than other groups. Differences between community-living and shelter-living abused women point to the utility of including appropriate comparison groups in studies of abused women. Adapted from the source document.

Preliminary Results of a Police-Advocate Home-Visit Intervention Project for Victims of Domestic Violence

Author: Casey, Robert L1; Berkman, Miriam; Stover, Carla Smith; Gill, Kelley; Durso, Sasha; Marans, Steven1 Division of Pediatric Psychosocial Services, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61348482?accountid=14925

Abstract: A police-advocate home-visit intervention project was conducted with 204 women who were victims of domestic violence requiring police intervention. These women, who resided with their children at the time of the incident, received law enforcement-advocacy services through a home-visit project conducted by neighborhood patrol officers and battered women's advocates. A comparison group of battered women, receiving the intervention, and a matched group of battered women, receiving standard police intervention, revealed a significant reduction in calls for police service for the intervention group, for a 12-month period following the intervention. Additional investigation is required to fully understand the reason for this difference and the potential utility of this type of domestic violence intervention. Adapted from the source document.

Preventing Dating Violence in Public Schools: An Evaluation of an Interagency Collaborative Program for Youth

Author: Lowe, Laura A1; Jones, Chris D; Banks, Leon1 Department of Sociology, Anthropology, and Social Work, Social Work Division, Texas Tech University, Box 41012, Lubbock, TX 79409 laura.lowe@ttu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61394286?accountid=14925

Abstract: Many communities offer programs aimed at improving teen dating skills and knowledge about violence and sexual behavior. This research study evaluates one such program, operated by an interagency collaborative. Each of four participating community agencies provided one hour of curriculum during one week of health class. Lecture, group activities, and films were used in the intervention. A 0 X 0 design was used to examine changes in knowledge and attitudes among 74 students. Results indicate that most students began with fairly high knowledge levels and appropriate attitudes. Nevertheless, the program did appear to have a positive impact on those who exhibited less knowledge about and more tolerant attitudes toward exploitive dating behaviors at pre-test. Implications of results for the school context are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence by Another Name: Crimes of Passion in Fin-de-Siecle Paris

Author: Ferguson, Eliza Earle

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59973303?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article investigates practices of domestic violence behind "crimes of passion" in fin-de-siecle Paris. Professional discourses attributed crimes of passion to a loss of rational control caused by suggestive images in the media and the atomization of modern urban life. Yet far from being symptomatic of social disintegration, this article argues that crimes of passion reveal complex local systems of social control at the household and neighborhood level. Testimony in more than 250 cases of violent crime between domestic partners tried in the assize court of the Seine shows that victims and perpetrators alike were firmly embedded in close-knit urban communities, where neighbors had detailed knowledge of each other's daily lives and readily intervened in domestic disputes. From this perspective, it is possible to construct a social history of domestic violence even in a time and place where the concept was not yet subject to feminist analysis. Adapted from the source document.

Victims of War: The First World War, Returned Soldiers, and Understandings of Domestic Violence in Australia

Author: Nelson, Elizabeth

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/59967225?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the wake of the First World War in Australia, numerous ex-soldiers appeared before the courts after having committed acts of violence against their wives. Reports and records of these court cases suggest that many in the community accepted explanations that connected men's apparent nerve-shattering experiences of battle with their violent actions back home. While a link between war trauma and wife abuse appears to be borne out in many cases, there were also many instances where such a link clearly did not exist. As public attention focused on men's war injuries (whether real or assumed), the abuse suffered by wives was overlooked. The notion that returned soldiers' violence in the home was the result of mental disturbance can be seen as a contributing factor in the shift towards a psychological understanding of domestic violence that occurred in Australia over the first half of the twentieth century. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence Against Farm Women in Bangladesh: Causes and Consequences

Author: Parveen, Shahnaj11 Department of Agricultural Extension Education, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, Bangladesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61694527?accountid=14925

Abstract: The main focus of this study was to analyse the domestic violence against farm women. It was conducted in three villages of Mymensingh District in Bangladesh. Data were collected from January to April 2003 from one hundred and fifty six farm women through qualitative and quantitative data gathering methods. It was found that torture for dowry, under-valuation of women's work, threat of divorce, tortured by husbands' family members and physical assault were the most common forms of violence against women at domestic sphere. To cope with this violent situation, the majority of the women tried to convince their husbands showing more loyalty and affection. It was also found that early marriage, lack of knowledge and skills, land ownership and income were the most important causes of domestic violence against women that led to make them vulnerable. It was suggested that an integrated and combined effort by the development organisations through rural community initiatives would be highly effective to reduce the magnitude of violence against women. Creating awareness among rural people about different socio-cultural, political and legal issues by development agencies was considered as potentials to prevent violence against women at household level.

Role of Self-Determined Goals in Predicting Recidivism in Domestic Violence Offenders

Author: Lee, Mo Yee1; Uken, Adriana; Sebold, John1 Coll Social Work, Ohio State U, Columbus lee.355@osu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61380430?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: This study investigated the role of self-determined goals in predicting recidivism in domestic violence offenders. Method: The study was a posttest design with an annual follow-up of recidivism data of 88 court-mandated batterers who attended a solution-focused, goal-directed treatment program. We hypothesized that goal commitment, goal specificity, & goal agreement would predict recidivism, & that confidence to work on goals would affect the degree to which these factors predicted recidivism. Results: The recidivism rate for program participants was 10.2%, & the final model accounted for 58% of variance in recidivism. The model indicated that goal specificity & goal agreement positively predicted confidence to work on goals, which negatively predicted recidivism. Conclusions: Significance of the study was discussed with respect to the potential positive impact of utilizing self-determined goals, language of "self-determination," & "strengths & solutions" in batterer treatment as well as advances in social work intervention research.

Abstract: This article examines how women's non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were targeted as an important component of the democracy building and civil society promotion programs of the post-socialist period. In particular, it focuses on NGO organizing around the issue of domestic violence in Armenia. It argues that the framing of the problem along with the proposed solutions led to civil society resistance to and critique of the anti-domestic violence campaign. It considers both the causes and the implications of this resistance on organizing around domestic violence as well as the responses and adaptations of the NGOs involved in the campaign.

Domestic Violence: Comparative Analysis of German and U.K. Research Findings

Author: Smartt, Ursula1; Kury, Helmut1 Thames Valley University, London

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61696530?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective This article examines the notion of the family and within its postmodern definition the research undertaken in the field of domestic violence and its consequences for criminal justice agencies in the United Kingdom and Germany. Has the notion of the family changed in Western culture? How has legislation changed regarding domestic violence in line with criminologists' and social scientists' hypotheses, reflections, and recommendations? How are victims and witnesses protected from perpetrators? Methods The authors discuss how legislation in both countries has changed to meet the needs of victims and witnesses of domestic violence. The article looks at different forms of law enforcement in domestic violence and how the agencies assess future dangerousness. Results Research analyses show that domestic violence is now taken seriously in both countries' legislation. But what is the impact on policing domestic violence in both countries? It is argued that U.K. law enforcement agencies are more advanced that the German police in dealing with domestic violence in a practical and pragmatic fashion. Conclusions The authors explore the shift in cultural beliefs affecting male dominance in the family setting, how public attitudes to domestic violence have changed, and how law enforcement agencies are now dealing with violence within the family in both countries.

Domestic violence against women: A field study in Turkey

Author: Kocacik, Faruk1; Kutlar, Aziz; Erselcan, Feray1 Department of Sociology, Cumhuriyet University, Faculty of Science and Literature, 58140 Sivas, Turkey kocacik@cumhuriyet.edu.tr

Abstract: Factors affecting domestic violence against women in four Turkish cities (Adiyaman, Sivas, Denizli and Kirklareli) having different socioeconomic structures, are analyzed in this study. These factors consist of social, cultural, economic and psychological factors. In contrast to what we expected based on earlier literature, family income level has a positive relationship with violence. Logistic regression analysis also revealed that being a university graduate and having a personal income decreases the prevalence of violence as expected. However, working women and women with children are more prone to domestic violence. Again, there is a strong association between the neighborhood where the family lives and the incidence of violence. The extent of male dominance, as measured by the question 'How are decisions taken in the family' is also associated with domestic violence: woman is less likely to be abused in households where decisions are taken collectively. Likewise, families where women have to get permission from the husband to carry out certain activities, have an increased incidence of suffering from husband's violence. Psychological factors, like being abused or having witnessed violence as a child, are also significantly correlated with domestic violence. [Copyright 2007 Elsevier Inc.]

An Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Implementation and Impact of a Comprehensive Approach to Domestic Violence

Author: Muftic, Lisa R1; Bouffard, Jeffrey A1 Department of Criminal Justice, University of North Texas, Denton

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61375501?accountid=14925

Abstract: The primary goal of society's response to domestic violence is the protection of the victim from further abuse. Recently, the coordinated community response (CCR) has been developed as one example of an approach aimed at reaching this goal. Prior research has generally found support for the model, with male offenders recidivating at lower rates. The current study examines whether a comprehensive, community-based approach is capable of reducing recidivism rates among male and female offenders. Comparisons are made between 70 female and 131 male offenders. Specific attention is given to the intervention process, including differences in service or treatment component completion and recidivism by gender.

Collegiate Sororities and Dating Violence: An Exploratory Study of Informal and Formal Helping Strategies

Author: Anderson, Kim M1; Danis, Fran S1 University of Missouri-Columbia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61602694?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women in collegiate sororities are more at risk for violence within the context of dating relationships than is the general population of college women. Because assaulted women are more likely to turn to their peer networks for support, this study explores the formal and informal helping strategies available to sorority members within the context of their sororities. A total of 35 women representing 17 different sororities participated in 4 focus groups. Although the central finding uncovered how violence is largely omitted from the formal agendas of sororities, community and campus-based programs addressing the issue can build on their sincere interest in helping each other.

Borderline Personality Symptomatology and History of Domestic Violence Among Women in an Internal Medicine Setting

Author: Sansone, Randy A1; Reddington, Anne; Sky, Karen; Wiederman, Michael W1 Sycamore Primary Care Center, 2115 Leiter Road, Miamisburg, OH 45342 E-mail: Randy.sansone@kmcnetwork.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61693040?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this study of primary care patients, we examined the relationship between a history of domestic violence (measured with the Severity of Violence Against Women Scale [SVAWS) and borderline personality (measured with the Self-Harm Inventory [SHI] and the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4 [PDQ-4]). We elected borderline personality for examination because several diagnostic criteria sets describe relationship features suggestive of partner abuse. In this study, both measures of borderline personality were highly related to each other (r = .73, p < .00 1). Adapted from the source document.

Borderline and Antisocial Personality Scores as Mediators Between Attachment and Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Mauricio, Anne Marie1; Tein, Jenn-Yun; Lopez, Frederick G1 Arizona Prevention Research Center, Arizona State University, P.O. Box 876005, Tempe, AZ 85287-6005 E-mail: anne.mauricio@asu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61640248?accountid=14925

Abstract: Court-mandated male batterers (n = 192) attending an intervention program completed measures examining adult attachment orientations (anxious and avoidant), personality disorders (borderline and antisocial), type of violence (psychological and physical), and social desirability. Structural equation modeling was used to determine whether there were significant relationships between anxious attachment and physical and psychological violence that are mediated by either borderline or antisocial personality disorders. Social desirability was included in both models as a covariate. Results indicated that personality disorders fully mediated the relationship between avoidant attachment and physical as well as psychological violence. Personality disorders only partially mediated the relationship between anxious attachment and psychological violence. Implications for intervention are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Children's Direct Sensory Exposure to Substantiated Domestic Violence Crimes

Author: Fantuzzo, John; Fusco, Rachel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61378338?accountid=14925

Abstract: Police officers served as public health sentinels to collect data on children exposed to domestic violence events (DVEs) across an entire municipality for 1 year. These officers used a standard, validated protocol to collect data on all investigate DVEs. This study extended previous research by including data demographic data on children in the household at the time of the DVE and investigating children's direct sensory exposure to DVEs. Findings revealed that almost half of all events had children present, and 81% of these children were directly exposed to DVEs. Children under the age of 6 years old were at greater risk of direct sensory exposure. Domestic violence households with children were more likely to be low-income, non-White, and headed by a single female compared to households at large. Logistic regressions revealed that six major DVE variables were related to children being directly exposed. These included father as perpetrator, victim injury, weapon use, non-White victim, mutual assault, and arrest of perpetrator. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT].

Effects of Social Desirability on Students' Self-Reporting of Partner Abuse Perpetration and Victimization

Author: Bell, Kathryn M1; Naugle, Amy E1 Department of Psychology, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI 49008-5439 E-mail: amy.naugle@wmich.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61410129?accountid=14925

Abstract: Little is still known about the degree to which social desirability affects reports of partner abuse. The current study builds on existing research exploring the relationship between social desirability and partner abuse reports by analyzing 49 male and 155 female students' responses to the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2) and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MCSDS). Sex differences were not associated with partner abuse rates, regardless of type, severity, and violence role. Women had significantly higher social desirability scores than men, and women's MCSDS scores were negatively correlated with partner abuse perpetration and victimization rates. Social desirability was a significant predictor of psychological abuse perpetration, whereas gender was a significant predictor of sexual coercion perpetration. In all partner abuse cases, however, social desirability and gender accounted for less than 10% of the variance in partner abuse reports. Adapted from the source document.

Youth Violence Trajectories and Proximal Characteristics of Intimate Partner Violence

Abstract: Analyses first examined the developmental course of intimate partner violence (IPV), beginning with trajectories of youth violence. We then examined potential mediators of prior youth violence trajectories in models predicting later IPV perpetration as an outcome. Potential mediators include risks associated with the individual (e.g., current alcohol and drug use and mental health diagnosis), characteristics of a perpetrator's partner (e.g., use of alcohol/drugs and history of antisocial behavior), and aspects of the surrounding community (e.g., neighborhood norms favorable to violence and drug use). Data are from the Seattle Social Development Project, a longitudinal study of over 800 individuals followed from elementary school to young adulthood (age 24). Findings suggest that both chronic and late-increaser patterns of youth violence elevated the likelihood of later IPV perpetration. Partial mediation effects of the relation between youth violence and IPV were found for variables related to one's partner and the surrounding community. Individual characteristics of the perpetrator were not uniquely predictive of IPV when measured as a risk index and modeled along with other risk factors. Findings indicate that the risk of IPV could be lessened by addressing earlier forms of violence and by intervening to reduce risks within and across domains of influence.

Female Victims of Domestic Violence: Which Victims Do Police Refer to Crisis Intervention?

Author: Kernic, Mary A1; Bonomi, Amy E1 Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center, Box 359960, 325 Ninth Avenue, Seattle, WA 981042499 E-mail: mkernic@u.washington.edu

Abstract: Factors associated with activation of a volunteer-based crisis intervention services program for victims of police-reported intimate partner violence (IPV) were examined to determine if those for whom services were activated were representative of the overall eligible population. The study population comprised 2,092 adult female victims of male-perpetrated police-reported IPV. Crisis intervention services were requested by responding patrol officers in 415 (19.8%) of these incidents. Activation of crisis intervention services was more likely for victims who were married to their abusive partner, pregnant, or of Latina or Asian race/ethnicity and among IPV incidents involving physical abuse, visible victim injuries, and arrest of the abusive partner. Additionally, one of the citys five police precincts was less likely than the remaining four to utilize these services. Activation of crisis intervention services was associated with factors related to need and feasibility of service delivery, but differential activation at the precinct level was also found to be influential. Adapted from the source document.

Maternal Childhood Parental Abuse History and Current Intimate Partner Violence: Data from the Pacific Islands Families Study

Abstract: Pacific peoples are a rapidly growing but socially disadvantaged segment of New Zealand society. Within this context, individuals may be particularly vulnerable to the experience of intimate partner violence (IPV). The aim of the study was to establish the association between the experience of maternal and/or paternal emotional or physical abuse and current severe physical partner violence perpetration or victimization among a cohort of Pacific women. Paternal physical abuse was the only statistically significant risk factor from childhood parenting history that was independently associated with severe physical perpetration and victimization within the mothers current intimate partner relationship (RR 2.6). These findings highlight the deleterious effect of paternal physical violence on subsequent IPV and contribute to the development of empirically based and considered ways to approach these complex phenomena.

Gender Differences in the Relationship Between Intimate Partner Violence Victimization and the Perception of Dating Situations Among College Students

Author: Prospero, Moises1; Vohra-Gupta, Shetal1 561 Jake Garn Boulevard, Salt Lake City, UT 84104 E-mail: moises.prospero@socwk.utah.edu

Abstract: Although the prevalence and severity of dating violence among college students is well known, the relationship between past victimization and perceptions of future dating situations has not been examined. Using both qualitative and quantitative research methods, this study investigated gender differences in the relationship between intimate partner violence victimization and the perceptions of dating situations. The study found that the more psychological, physical, or sexual violence that was experienced by females, the more likely they perceived dating situations as inappropriate. Males, on the other hand, were more likely to report aggressive behaviors in dating situations only if victimized by sexual violence. Implications for professionals working with college students or community prevention programs are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

The Relationship Between Mothers Social Networks and Severe Domestic Violence: A Test of the Social Isolation Hypothesis

Author: Coohey, Carol11 School of Social Work, University of Iowa, 308 North Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242 E-mail: carol-coohey@uiowa.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61408518?accountid=14925

Abstract: To understand the relationship between characteristics of mothers social networks and domestic violence, battered mothers who were severely assaulted were compared to battered mothers who were not severely assaulted and mothers who were not assaulted. The results showed that all three groups of mothers had several family members in their social networks with whom they had frequent contact during the past month. No differences were found between the groups on the number of family members who gave emotional support. However, the mothers who were severely assaulted had fewer friends, fewer contacts with their friends, fewer long-term friendships, and fewer friends who really listened to them than did the nonbattered mothers and the battered mothers who were not severely assaulted. Batterers may be more successful in disrupting friendship ties than family ties. Adapted from the source document.

Preliminary Report on the Accountability Scale: A Change and Outcome Measure for Intimate Partner Violence Research

Author: Costa, Daniela M; Canady, Brittany; Babcock, Julia C

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61351687?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study investigated the reliability of a new self-report questionnaire assessing accountability for the perpetration of intimate partner violence. The Accountability Scale (AS) is a brief, Likert-type measure designed to assess the degree to which perpetrators acknowledge and accept responsibility for their violent actions. In Study #1, an exploratory factor analysis on a clinical sample revealed two factors: Acknowledging Harm and Internalizing Responsibility. In Study #2, the factor structure was replicated on a community sample using confirmatory factor analysis, revealing an 11-item solution. Factor 1 was related to readiness to change but negatively related to social desirability, suggesting convergent and discriminant validity of that subscale. Factor 2 was negatively related to Factor 1 in the community sample, calling into question the construct of accountability. Preliminary evidence suggests that the AS shows promise as a brief and reliable tool to assess forms of accountability. Future research will examine if the two factors of accountability function as mechanisms of change and outcome measures in intimate partner violence intervention research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT].

Female Domestic Violence Offenders: Their Attachment Security, Trauma Symptoms, and Personality Organization

Author: Goldenson, Julie; Geffner, Robert; Foster, Sharon L; Clipson, Clark R

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60197824?accountid=14925

Abstract: Unlike male domestic violence offenders, female domestic violence offenders have traditionally been overlooked in research and theory, despite the fact that females also have high rates of domestic violence perpetration. Towards the aim of extending extant research on male and female pepetrators of domestic violence, we examined attachment style, trauma symptoms, and personality organization in 33 female offenders receiving mandated treatment for domestic violence. These offenders were compared to 32 nonoffending women receiving psychological treatment. The Experiences in Close Relationships Revised (ECR-Revised) was used to examine adult attachment, the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) was used to examine trauma symptomology, and finally, the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III (MCMI-III) was used to examine cluster B personality traits. Analyses indicated that female domestic violence offenders reported less attachment security, more trauma-related symptoms, and more personality psychopathology (Antisocial, Borderline, and Dependent Subscales) than did nonoffender clinical comparison women.

Perceptions of Motives in Intimate Partner Violence: Expressive Versus Coercive Violence

Author: Hamel, John; Desmarais, Sarah L; Nicholls, Tonia L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61366748?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined perceptions of motives in the perpetration of intimate partner violence. Respondents (N = 401) of diverse professions read three vignettes and indicated their perception of the aggressor's motive (from 1 = Exclusively Expressive; 5 = Exclusively Coercive). Half of respondents read vignettes describing male-perpetrated violence against a female partner; the other half, female-perpetrated violence against a male partner. Overall, male-perpetrated aggression was seen as more coercive than female-perpetrated aggression, particularly by shelter workers and victim advocates. Further analyses revealed that men generally gave higher ratings than women, and that women rated female-perpetrated aggression as less coercive than male-perpetrated aggression. In contrast, men did not differ in their ratings of male versus female perpetration. Implications are discussed with respect to the assessment and treatment of partner violence.

Prevalence, Perpetrators, and Characteristics of Witnessing Parental Violence and Adult Dating Violence in Latina, East Asian, South Asian, and Middle Eastern Women

Author: Maker, Azmaira H; deRoon-Cassini, Terri A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61417263?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study describes and compares the prevalence, perpetrators, and characteristics of witnessing parental violence during childhood and experiencing adult relationship violence in 251 college-educated South Asian/Middle Eastern (n = 93), East Asian (n = 72), and Latina (n = 86) women residing in the United States. Results showed that more than 50% of each ethnic group witnessed parental and adult relationship violence. For all three groups, adult psychological violence was more prevalent than physical violence, which, in turn, was more prevalent than injury violence. Significant differences were found for paternal and maternal psychological, physical, and injury violence witnessed within ethnic groups. High prevalence rates and significant differences emerged for psychological, physical, and injury violence experienced as a victim and enacted as a perpetrator within ethnic groups. The implications of college-educated, higher socioeconomic status (SES) women of color being at risk for witnessing and experiencing family violence are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This article is one of the first to extensively compare characteristics of women who do and do not report stalking by a violent partner or ex-partner using a large sample of women with civil protective orders. Specifically, the purpose of this study was to examine similarities and differences in relationship and victimization history characteristics, mental health symptoms, help-seeking, and protective order violations for women who report being stalked in the past year (n = 345) by the partner they received a protective order against compared to women who received a protective order against a violent partner but who report no stalking by that partner ever in the relationship (n = 412). Results indicate that women who report partner stalking have more severe partner violence victimization, histories, increased distress, greater fear, and more protective order violations, suggesting that partner stalking victimization warrants more research and practice attention.

Social Inequalities in Intimate Partner Violence: A Study of Women in Kenya

Author: Lawoko, Stephen1; Dalal, Koustuv; Jiayou, Luo; Jansson, Bjarne1 Stockholm Centre of Public Health, SUF, Vastgotagatan 2, Box 17533, SE-118 91 Stockholm, Sweden stephen.lawoko@sll.se

Abstract: This study examines social inequalities in intimate partner violence (WV) among women of reproductive age in Kenya. A sample comprising 3,696 women was retrieved from the Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey of 2003. The study design was cross-sectional. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results indicated that while high education among women reduced the risk of IPV exposure, both being employed and having a higher education/occupational status than her partner increased a woman's vulnerability to IPV. Age differences between the partners, illiteracy, and lack of autonomy and access to information increased the likelihood of WV. Finally, being in polygamous relationships was associated with WV exposure. The findings indicate demographic, social, and structural differences in exposure to WV with important implications for interventions. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Abuse, Health Status, and Social Functioning

Author: McCaw, Brigid1; Golding, Jacqueline M; Farley, Melissa; Minkoff, Jerome R1 Family Violence Prevention Program, Kaiser Permanente, 1950 Franklin, 18th Floor, Bayside, Oakland, CA 94612

Abstract: Background: Current and past history of domestic violence (DV), including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse is common among women patients seen in health care settings and is associated with a higher frequency of many health problems. However, the association of DV with self-assessed social functioning is less well known. Methods: We administered a telephone survey to a random sample of 391 women HMO members seen for a routine annual check-up. The survey included questions about current and past physical, sexual, and emotional violence and self-assessed social functioning and health status from the SF-36. We included questions about attitudes toward routine DV screening, likelihood of disclosure, and the health care setting as a resource. Results: Seven percent of the women reported recent DV and 34% reported lifetime abuse. Abuse was related to limitations in social functioning (adjusted OR = 2.26). Among women with no recent history of abuse, those with a history of past physical (adjusted OR = 1.90), sexual (adjusted OR = 2.04), or emotional (adjusted OR = 2.20) abuse reported significantly poorer social functioning. Emotional abuse, even in the absence of a history of physical or sexual abuse, was strongly associated with limitations in social functioning (adjusted OR = 4.95). Most women believed it appropriate for clinicians to inquire routinely about DV (87%) and 83% believed that the health care setting was a source of help. Conclusions: Current and past DV, including emotional abuse, adversely affect social functioning. Therefore, clinicians in the health care setting have a unique and important opportunity to assist women victims of DV and abuse. Adapted from the source document.

An Exploratory Examination of the Meanings of Residual Injuries from Intimate Partner Violence

Abstract: The meanings attached to residual injuries resulting from intimate partner violence (IPV) may play an important role in shaping psychological distress associated with these experiences. This study explored IPV victims' personal definitions and meanings of their residual IPV-related injuries as a first step in determining the potential psychological implications. Sixteen female victims of IPV with partner violence- related residual injuries, defined as marks, scars, and other permanent changes to their bodies met in small groups of 3-5 participants. Group discussions focused on the meanings individuals associated with their most distressing residual injury and the implications of those meanings for body image, interpersonal relationships, cues for posttraumatic responses, and other emotional reactions. Findings suggested that IPV related injuries may be connected to the IPV, IPV-related blame, and may have implications for victims' self-identity and perceived potential for future relationships.

Understanding the Impact of Prior Abuse and Prior Victimization on the Decision to Forego Criminal Justice Assistance in Domestic Violence Incidents: A Life-Course Perspective

Author: Buzawa, Eve1; Hotaling, Gerald T; Byrne, James1 Department of Criminal justice and Criminology, University of Massachusetts, Lowell

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61425149?accountid=14925

Abstract: While there has been much attention focused on offenders, crime, and desistance from crime through the life course, researchers have largely ignored victimization and desistance from victimization through the life course. Focusing specifically on domestic violence among a cohort of offenders and victims in a single court setting (Quincy, Massachusetts), the authors explore the factors (including both offender and victim characteristics) related to revictimization and then examine the difference between those victims who do not report revictimization to the police and those victims who do report The research reported here demonstrates that a childhood history of abuse may increase the probability that revictimization-if/when it occurs-will not be reported to police. The implications of this finding for criminal justice system's response to victims of domestic violence are discussed, focusing on (a) the development of new strategies for the identification and control of revictimization that are proactive and police- and/or probation-driven as well as (b) new approaches to treatment and crisis intervention that recognize the importance of understanding victimization-both at the individual and family level-throughout the life course. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This study investigated the impact of violence exposure on youth attitudes toward violence and guns. Rural youth were surveyed on their exposure to violence in the home, school, and neighborhood in addition to their attitudes toward guns and violence. Results indicated youth were exposed to an alarming amount of violence in each setting, particularly the school. Findings also demonstrated that attitudes toward violence and guns were significantly influenced by violence in the home and being male. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: A screening instrument for detecting intimate partner violence (IPV) was developed using indirect questions. The authors identified 5 of 18 items studied that clearly distinguished victims of IPV from a random group of health conference attendees with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 87%. This 5-item instrument (SAFE-T) was then tested on 435 women presenting to three emergency departments and the results compared to a direct question regarding current abuse. The SAFE-T questions detected only 54% of the women who admitted being abused and correctly classified 81% of the women who said they were not victims. The 1-year prevalence of IPV in this sample of women presenting to an emergency department was 11.6%. The authors conclude that indirect questioning of women appears to be more effective at ruling out IPV in an emergency department population and may be less useful for women 'early' in an abusive relationship.

Intimate Partner Violence in Older Women

Author: Bonomi, Amy E1; Anderson, Melissa L; Reid, Robert J; Carrell, David; Fishman, Paul A; Rivara, Frederick P; Thompson, Robert S1 Department of Human Development and Family Science, The Ohio State University, 1787 Neil Avenue, 135 Campbell Hall, Columbus, OH 43214. E-mail: bonomi.1@osu.edu

Abstract: Purpose: We describe the prevalence, types, duration, frequency, and severity of intimate partner violence ('partner violence') in older women. Design and Methods: We randomly sampled a total of 370 English-speaking women (65 years of age and older) from a health care system to participate in a cross-sectional telephone interview. Using 5 questions from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and 10 questions from the Women's Experience with Battering (WEB) Scale, we assessed a woman's exposure to partner violence. We estimated lifetime partner violence prevalence using the BRFSS questions (physical, forced intercourse, forced sexual contact, verbal threats, and controlling behavior), and we estimated past-5-year and past-year prevalence using the BRFSS and the WEB Scale. We estimated violence frequency, duration, and severity using the BRFSS questions. Results: According to the BRFSS, lifetime partner violence prevalence was 26.5%; 18.4% of women experienced physical or sexual violence and 21.9% experienced nonphysical violence (threats or controlling behavior). According to the BRFSS and WEB Scale, past-5-year violence prevalence was 3.5%, and past-year violence prevalence was 2.2%. Many abused women reported more than 20 episodes of violence in their lifetime (from 18.1% for physical violence to 61.2% for controlling behavior). The median duration ranged from 3 years (forced sexual contact) to 10 years (controlling behavior). The proportion of abused women rating their abuse as severe ranged from 39.1% (forced sex or sexual contact) to 70.7% (threats). Implications: The high lifetime partner violence occurrence, frequency, duration, and severity, coupled with results from prior studies indicating long-term adverse health effects of partner violence, suggest a need for increased efforts to address partner violence in older women.

An Overview of Intimate Partner Violence Among Latinos

Author: Klevens, Joanne11 Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Atlanta, GA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61608702?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reviews the existing literature on intimate partner violence (IPV) among Latinos to put the findings of this special issue into context. This review of the literature suggests that WV occurs as frequently among Latinos as among non-Latinos when con-founders are controlled for. There is also some preliminary evidence that Latinas experience similar forms of IPV and suffer similar consequences. Many of the risk factors associated with its occurrence are the same as those observed among non-Latinos, except that beliefs approving IPV and alcohol-drinking patterns may not have much explanatory value for the occurrence of IPV among Latinos. Role strain, especially as a result of immigration and acculturation, might be unique to Latinos, and its importance, and the importance of male dominance among Latinas experiencing IPV, deserve more research.

Intimate Partner Violence Among Latinas in Eastern North Carolina

Author: Denham, Amy C1; Frasier, Pamela York; Hooten, Elizabeth Gerken; Belton, Leigh; Newton, Warren; Gonzalez, Pamela; Begum, Munni; Campbell, Marci K1 U North Carolina, Chapel Hill

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389334?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores the correlates of intimate partner violence (IPV) among rural, southern Latinas. A sample of 1,212 women in blue-collar work sites in rural North Carolina completed a questionnaire assessing IPV and other social, demographic, and health-related variables. Social and demographic correlates of IPV were examined. Adult lifetime prevalence of IPV in Latinas was 19.5%, similar to that of non-Latinas. As compared to Latinas who did not experience IPV and non-Latinas who experienced IPV, Latinas who experienced IPV were more likely to lack social support and to have children in the home. Agencies that provide services to victims of IPV in the rural South need to be prepared to meet the unique needs of Latina immigrants.

Latinos' Perspectives and Experiences With Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Klevens, Joanne1; Shelley, Gene; Clavel-Arcas, Carmen; Barney, David D; Tobar, Cynthia; Duran, Elizabeth S; Barajas-Mazaheri, Ruth; Esparza, Janys1 Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Atlanta, GA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61668082?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study, utilizing focus group interviews with community members and in- depth interviews with victims and perpetrators, explored Latinos' beliefs and perceptions of IPV in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, as a basis for developing culturally appropriate intimate partner violence (IPV) services for this population. The findings from these interviews suggest that this community recognizes IPV as a problem and is aware of the multiple dimensions, potential causes, and negative consequences of IPV. In general, participants perceived family and neighbors as preferring to not get involved in situations of IPV. However, family was also expected to, and often did, provide tangible support to victims. Directions for developing prevention programs for this population and future research are suggested.

A Comparison of Help Seeking Between Latino and Non-Latino Victims of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Ingram, Eben M11 Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Atlanta, GA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61639535?accountid=14925

Abstract: Analyses based on a random-digit-dial survey of households (N = 12,039) compared Latinos and non-Latinos on sociodemographic factors for intimate partner violence (IPV) and help seeking. Lifetime prevalence of IPV was found to be lower for Latinos than for non-Latinos, but past-year prevalence of IPV was greater for Latinos. Reported IPV victimization was greater among non-Latinos than among Latinos at education levels below college and at family incomes less than $35,000. Informal help seeking was found to be similar for Latinos and non-Latinos; however, non-Latinos reported seeking access to shelters more frequently than Latinos, and Latino immigrants were less likely than non-immigrants to seek help from formal agencies.

Latino Teens Talk About Help Seeking and Help Giving in Relation to Dating Violence

Author: Ocampo, Beverly Weidmer1; Shelley, Gene A; Jaycox, Lisa H1 RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61635611?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors examine attitudes about help seeking and help giving related to dating violence among Latino ninth graders, including survey and focus group data. Latino teens are more likely to seek help for a dating violence situation from informal sources of support (e.g., friends) than from formal sources (e.g., health professionals). Students are most likely to turn to other teens for help and do not confide or trust the adults in their social network. Teens are reluctant to intervene in dating violence situations. The quality of help offered by teens related to dating violence is perceived as being limited. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2007.]

A Network Model for Providing Culturally Competent Services for Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence

Author: Whitaker, Daniel J1; Baker, Charlene K; Pratt, Carter; Reed, Elizabeth; Suri, Sonia; Pavlos, Carlene; Nagy, Beth Jacklin; Silverman, Jay1 Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Atlanta, GA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61635664?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Massachusetts Department of Public Health implemented the Collaborative for Abuse Prevention in Racial and Ethnic Communities (CARE) project in two Latino communities, in the city of Chelsea and in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. One goal of CARE was to build collaborative networks of service providers to provide culturally competent services. Networks of existing community-based agencies that provide a variety of different services regarding violence against women were established in both locales. This article describes the CARE model, network formation, initial attempts to build collaboration and cultural competence, outreach and education activities, and organizational-level changes resulting from the establishment of the networks. The challenges, successes, and lessons learned in implementing this network model are also discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2007.]

Working Women Making It Work: Intimate Partner Violence, Employment, and Workplace Support

Author: Swanberg, Jennifer1; Macke, Caroline; Logan, T K1 College of Social Work at the University of Kentucky

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61651267?accountid=14925

Abstract: Partner violence may have significant consequences on women's employment, yet limited information is available about how women cope on the job with perpetrators' tactics and the consequences of her coping methods on employment status. This article investigates whether there is an association between workplace disclosure of victimization and current employment status, and whether there is an association between receiving workplace support and current employment status among women who disclosed victimization circumstances to someone at work. Using a sample of partner victimized women who were employed within the past year (N = 485), cross-tabulation and ANOVA procedures were conducted to examine the differences between currently employed and unemployed women. Binary logistic regressions were conducted to examine whether disclosure and receiving workplace support were significantly associated with current employment. Results indicate that disclosure and workplace support are associated with employment. Implications for clinical practice, workplace policies, and future research are discussed.

Exploring the Literature on Relationships Between Gender Roles, Intimate Partner Violence, Occupational Status, and Organizational Benefits

Author: Kwesiga, Eileen1; Bell, Myrtle P; Pattie, Marshall; Moe, Angela M1 Department of management at Bryant University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61651168?accountid=14925

Abstract: Studies of intimate partner violence (IPV) and work have been primarily conducted with women in low-wage low-status (LWLS) positions, as much of this research has focused on poverty, welfare, and homelessness. Although women in LWLS positions represent a large percentage of working women in the United States, it is also important to investigate experiences of women in high-wage high-status (HWHS) positions because a growing number of women are employed within such jobs. We propose gender role theory can be used to explain occurrences of IPV among women in HWHS positions and their utilization of organizational benefits. We suggest those in HWHS positions may be likely to have access to organizational benefits (e.g., medical, vacation, and flexible work schedules) and the ability to utilize the Family and Medical Leave Act. However, prevailing gender roles existing in organizations may render women in HWHS positions unlikely to use benefits or to take leave.

The Effects and Costs of Intimate Partner Violence for Work Organizations

Author: Reeves, Carol1; O'Leary-Kelly, Anne M1 Department of Management at the University of Arkansas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61608787?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the productivity-related effects and costs of intimate partner violence (IPV) on the workplace. Specifically, it explores whether IPV victims and nonvictims differ in the number of work hours missed due to absenteeism, tardiness, and work distraction and the costs for employers from these missed work hours. The research involved a Web-based survey of 823 male and 1,550 female employees in three midsized organizations. Employees who reported lifetime IPV victimization, but not current victimization, missed more hours of work because of absenteeism than did nonvictims. Current victims, but not lifetime victims, were more likely to be distracted at work than nonvictims. Organization costs due to absenteeism and tardiness were greater for lifetime victims than nonvictims, however, no difference in costs was found for current victims. Overall, we found that IPV has negative effects on organizations, but that the nature and cost of these effects vary by type of victimization.

Intimate Partner Violence, Social Support, and Employment in the Post-Welfare Reform Era

Author: Staggs, Susan L1; Long, Susan M; Mason, Gillian E; Krishnan, Sandhya; Riger, Stephanie1 Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61404446?accountid=14925

Abstract: This prospective study used 3 years of longitudinal data to explore relationships among intimate partner violence (IPV), perceived emotional and material social support, employment stability, and job turnover among current and former female welfare recipients in the immediate post-welfare reform era. Higher levels of current IPV and lower levels of current social support predicted less stable future employment, however, current employment stability did not predict either future IPV or future social support. Current social support did not predict future IPV, and perceived social support did not mediate the relationship between IPV and employment stability during a 3-year period.

Domestic Violence and Human Rights: Local Challenges to a Universal Framework

Author: Morgaine, Karen11 Graduate School Social Work, Portland State U, OR morgaine@pdx.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389259?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over the past 15-20 years there has been a dramatic increase in transnational social movements including the movement to eradicate violence against women. This paper examines the development of the transnational women's movement & the prioritizing of violence against women (VAW) as a universal women's agenda using the United Nations (U.N.) human rights conferences as a focal point. As one form of VAW, domestic violence (DV) has been placed into the human rights context by many organizations globally. The implications & possible limitations of universalizing a framework for DV are explored using salient examples from various areas of the world. It is suggested that the framing of DV as a human rights violation is relevant to social work in light of social work's role in the critical analysis of framing of social problems & the emergent movement in the United States for social work to become more internationally-focused.

Understanding Causes of and Responses to Intimate Partner Violence in a Jewish Orthodox Community: Survivors' and Leaders' Perspectives

Author: Ringel, Shoshana1; Bina, Rena1 School of Social Work, University of Maryland, 525 West Redwood Street, Baltimore, MD 21201-1777 E-mail: sringel@ssw.umaryland.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61394220?accountid=14925

Abstract: There has been little research on intimate partner violence (IPV) in faith-based communities. This qualitative study examines social attitudes and religious values in an Ultra-Orthodox Jewish community that affect the incidence of IPV and prevent women survivors from seeking help. Interviews were conducted with 8 Orthodox women and 11 community leaders, and findings include the following: (a) causes of IPV were early marriage, separation of the sexes, and personality characteristics, (b) religious beliefs and social values were barriers to seeking help, and (c) the role of rabbis in education and marital intervention was viewed in markedly different ways by the two sets of respondents. Implications for practice and further research are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2007.]

"When You're Involved, It's Just Different": Making Sense of Domestic Violence

Author: Berns, Nancy1; Schweingruber, David1 Drake U, Des Moines, IA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61646363?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores how people make sense of domestic violence. The authors argue that it is easier to make sense of other people's problems than your own. If people are trying to understand a social problem with which they are personally involved, they are likely to engage in interpretive work that connects their own experiences with the problem and with a possible troubled identity. However, the person not involved in the social problem does not have the additional troubled identity construction occurring. This process of evaluating claims and constructing different narratives of the self and the social problem helps explain the differences between victims' and nonvictims' understandings of social issues.

No Refuge: An Exploratory Survey of Nightmares, Dreams, and Sleep Patterns in Women Dealing With Relationship Violence

Author: Rasmussen, Brian11 U British Columbia-Okanagan, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61646409?accountid=14925

Abstract: This exploratory survey examined the dreams, nightmares, and sleep patterns of 30 women who were dealing with relationship violence. The sample of women was taken from two transition homes and a family counseling center. The findings indicate that 50% of the sample experienced nightmares on a weekly basis. Some of the dream images included drowning, being chased, being killed, or killing others. Slightly more than half (56%) experienced a recurring dream. Most women had trouble falling asleep and, on average, slept for 6.1 hours per night. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

Attributing Responsibility for Child Maltreatment When Domestic Violence Is Present

Author: Landsman, Miriam J1; Hartley, Carolyn Copps1 School Social Work, U Iowa, Iowa City

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61689738?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine factors that influence how child welfare workers attribute responsibility for child maltreatment & child safety in cases involving domestic violence. Methods: The study used a factorial survey approach, combining elements of survey research with an experimental design. Case vignettes were constructed by randomly assigning characteristics to vignettes believed to be related to assessments about responsibility for child maltreatment. Public child welfare workers were systematically sampled & asked to rate vignettes on male & female caregivers' responsibility for child maltreatment & concerns for safety. Results: The presence of domestic violence significantly affected workers' assessments of the attribution of responsibility & concern for child safety, more so than variables related to child maltreatment. Responsibility for exposing a child to domestic violence differed for males & females, with more factors explaining female responsibility. Substance use by either caregiver was significant in attributing responsibility for physical harm, not watching the child closely enough, & concern for child safety, but not for exposure to domestic violence. Conclusions: Domestic violence appeared to heighten workers' assessments of responsibility for child maltreatment & concerns about child safety, taking precedence over the characteristics of the child maltreatment itself. Battering tends to work against the domestic violence victim in terms of the attribution of responsibility. A greater number of factors affect female responsibility for exposing a child to domestic violence than male responsibility, even though in every case the male was the designated domestic violence batterer.

Assessment of intimate partner violence by child welfare services

Author: Hazen, Andrea L1; Connelly, Cynthia D; Edleson, Jeffrey L; Kelleher, Kelly J; Landverk, John A; Coben, Jeffrey H; Barth, Richard P; McGeehan, Jennifer; Rolls, Jennifer A; Nuszkowski, Melanie A1 Child and Adolescent Services Research Center, Children's Hospital and Health Center, San Diego, CA, United States email: ahazen@casrc.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61419518?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to describe policy and practice with respect to the assessment of intimate partner violence in a sample of child welfare agencies located throughout the United States and to examine the relationship of contextual characteristics and assessment practices. Telephone interviews were conducted with key informants from child welfare agencies. A snowball interviewing strategy was used to identify the best informant in each agency. Almost all of the participating agencies conducted some assessment of intimate partner violence, with most reporting that the majority of screening or assessment occurred during investigation of referrals. However, only 43.1% reported that all of the families referred to the child welfare system were assessed for intimate partner violence, and 52.8% indicated they had a written policy pertaining to screening and assessment of the problem. There was little relationship between county or agency characteristics and assessment practices. Additional research is needed to determine factors that influence assessment practices and to identify strategies to support and extend efforts to identify intimate partner violence and provide appropriate services for families in the child welfare system.

Definitions of and Beliefs About Wife Abuse Among Undergraduate Students of Social Work

Author: Haj-Yahia, Muhammad M1; Schiff, Miriam1 The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mt. Scopus, Israel, mshayah@MSCC.huji.ac.il

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810461651?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article focuses on definitions of and beliefs about wife abuse among undergraduate social work students in Israel. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires. The vast majority of students in Study 1 acknowledged acts thought to constitute wife assault and disapproved of a husband's use of force against his wife. The majority of students in Study 2 did not justify wife abuse nor tend to believe that battered women benefit from beating, although they tended to blame the violent husband for his behavior. Significant amounts of the variance in dependent variables were explained by the students' marital role expectations (Study 1) and their attitudes toward women and sex role stereotypes (Study 2). The students' year of study and participation in family violence or wife abuse courses did not contribute toward explaining the variance in their beliefs. Results are discussed in light of the students' patriarchal ideology, and implications for future research are presented.

Domestic Violence Abusers: A Descriptive Study of the Characteristics of Defenders in Protection from Abuse Orders in Sedgwick County, Kansas

Author: Etter, Gregg W, Sr1; Birzer, Michael L1 School of Community Affairs, Wichita State University E-mail: michael.birzer@wichita.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61415957?accountid=14925

Abstract: Protection from abuse orders have been presented in the contemporary literature as one of many tools in protecting battered women. While protection from abuse orders provides legal protection from abuse, many abusers violate these court orders. The current study describes the characteristics of 1,873 alleged domestic violence abusers in Sedgwick County, Kansas. Data were collected from protection from abuse filings over a 12-month time frame. The data were used to examine the demographics of offenders as well as to assess the prior arrests of the offenders. Results showed that abusers were typically white males, average age of 33 with extensive past criminal arrest histories. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Risk Factors among Korean Immigrant Women in the United States

Author: Lee, Eunju11 Assistant Professor, Department of Social Welfare, Dongguk University, Korea E-mail: ejlee@dongguk.ac.kr

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61424521?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic Violence is a serious problem among Korean immigrant women in the United States. However, little is known about the incidence of domestic violence as well as risk factors predicting violence experienced in intimate relationships. The purpose of this study is to describe domestic violence among Korean immigrant women, including type and frequency of violence and predictive factors of domestic violence experienced by Korean immigrant women. One hundred and thirty-six Korean women completed questionnaires developed in this study. Results indicate that domestic violence is a major family problem for Korean immigrant women. Implications are discussed in terms of the need of social services for Korean immigrant women. Adapted from the source document.

Young Children's Exposure to Intimate Partner Violence: Towards a Developmental Risk and Resilience Framework for Research and Intervention

Author: Gewirtz, Abigail H1; Edleson, Jeffrey L1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Minnesota, 2540 Riverside Ave. Minneapolis, MN 55454, USA E-mail: agewirtz@umn.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61641880?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article employs a developmental risk and resilience framework to examine the impact of exposure to intimate partner violence on young children, particularly those facing economic hardship. In doing so, it reviews and weaves together two separate literatures, one on emotional and behavioral development in high-risk settings and the other on children exposed to adult domestic violence. The article ends by pointing to the need for further research and the promise that early interventions hold for helping children who are exposed to intimate partner violence and living in poverty. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This study investigates whether depression in women who experienced intimate partner violence is associated with having also experienced childhood sexual and physical abuse, psychological abuse by an intimate partner, recent involvement with the abusive partner, and bodily pain. Fifty-seven women who had left a violent relationship with an intimate partner completed measures assessing their demographic characteristics, experiences of abuse in childhood and in their relationship with their intimate partner, and depressive symptoms. Multiple regression analysis showed that women's depression was significantly greater among those who had experienced childhood physical and sexual abuse, more severe psychological abuse, and greater bodily pain (p < .001), adjusted R super(2) = .32. These results suggest characteristics that can help to identify abused women who are most at risk for depression, and they suggest specific issues that may need to be addressed in this population.

Screening Practices for Adolescent Dating Violence

Author: Brown, Larry K1; Puster, Kristie L; Vazquez, Elizabeth A; Hunter, Heather L; Lescano, Celia M1 Bradley/Hasbro Children's Research Center, One Hoppin Street, Suite 204, Providence, RI 02903 E-mail: LKBrown@lifespan.org

Abstract: This study sought to determine the screening practices of child and adolescent psychiatrists regarding adolescent dating violence (DV). A questionnaire regarding screening practices for DV and other risk behaviors was administered to 817 child and adolescent psychiatrists via the Internet and mail. Twenty-one percent of clinicians screened for DV "more than 90% of the time," and 65% had identified it in the past year. Multiple logistic regression analyses found that screening for DV was associated with consistent screening for either substance use or interparental violence (OR = 3.0 and 6.3, respectively). Despite the prevalence of DV, only a minority of psychiatrists screen their adolescent patients for this type of risk. These data suggest that screening for DV is associated with consistent screening practices for other risk behaviors. Screening rates may be improved with training and adherence to specific protocols.

Providing Services to Survivors of Domestic Violence: A Comparison of Rural and Urban Service Provider Perceptions

Author: Eastman, Brenda J1; Bunch, Shelia Grant1 School Social Work, Coll Human Ecology, East Carolina U, Greenville, North Carolina eastmanbr@ecu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61668623?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although there is a considerable body of knowledge about domestic violence, a limited proportion focuses on domestic violence in rural settings. Using a nonprobability purposive sampling technique, 93 providers of domestic violence services from rural and urban localities in North Carolina and Virginia were located and asked to complete a self-administered survey soliciting provider perceptions about service consumers, the general public, themselves, and inter- and intra-agency issues. Significant differences were observed between rural and urban providers about service consumer needs and experiences, perceptions about the general public, area resource availability, agency funding, provider training, and worker safety. Implications of these differences are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2007.]

Predicting the use of aggressive conflict tactics in a sample of women arrested for domestic violence

Author: Hughes, Farrah M1; Stuart, Gregory L; Coop Gordon, Kristina; Moore, Todd M1 Francis Marion University, FHughes@FMarion.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811135313?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explored factors that might place women at risk for utilizing physical aggression in their relationships. Women (N = 103) court-referred to violence intervention programs completed measures of family of origin violence, relationship aggression, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and borderline personality features. Relationship aggression was correlated with reports of parent-to-child violence in the family of origin, borderline personality features, and the partner's use of violence. Regression analyses indicated that, controlling for partners' aggression, PTSD symptoms were negatively associated with physical aggression, and borderline features were positively associated with physical aggression. The relationship between family of origin violence and the use of physically aggressive conflict tactics was mediated by borderline features. Study limitations and implications for future research are discussed.

Intimate partner violence among Afghan women living in refugee camps in Pakistan

Author: Hyder, Adnan A1; Noor, Zarin; Tsui, Emma1 John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Center for Injury Research & Policy, USA, Tel.: + 14109553928, Fax: + 14106141419 E-mail: ahyder@jhsph.edu

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore events and factors that lead to conflict in the home in the Afghan refugee setting, and the current status of the health sector's ability to respond to evidence of conflict. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 women of reproductive age and 20 health workers serving these women in an Afghan refugee camp near Peshawar, Pakistan, during the summer of 2004. In particular, this paper analyses women's explanations of how various marriage traditions may be linked to conflict in the home and how the interactions of different family members may be related to conflict. The relationships of women with their parents-in-law and husbands are highlighted in particular, and a model developed to explore the choreography of their relationships and the ways in which these dynamics may encourage or inhibit violence. The perspectives of health workers on the ways in which the health system responds to family conflict and violence are also presented. Finally, this paper provides information that helps to frame the issues of family violence and conflict in long-term refugee populations for intervention designers and those who are working to craft a health sector response to this problem.

Family Violence in Congregations: An Exploratory Study of Clergy's Needs

Author: Homiak, Katie Brennan1; Singletary, Jon E1 Metropolitan Lutheran Ministries, Kansas City, MO

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61422719?accountid=14925

Abstract: Studies of clergy, congregations, and victims of family violence often portray the church as a place of ongoing hope and increased pain. Some clergy deny that family violence is present in their congregations or feel ill-equipped to address it, other clergy are highly aware of this problem and are proactive in addressing its effects on families. In this study, the researcher mailed a survey to 100 different clergy in the (254) area code of central Texas in order to explore the number of abuse cases reported to clergy, how clergy address family violence, and the needs of clergy in responding to cases of reported abuse. Clergy also described their responses to these reports of abuse, which included confronting the families, informing authorities, referring victims to outside resources, and providing emotional, spiritual, and sometimes financial support. A small percentage of clergy felt very equipped to counsel victims of domestic violence (8%) or refer them to community resources (32%). The author provides implications for social workers, which include providing training for clergy and initiating collaborative relationships with congregations. Clergy need to promote violence-free congregations by recognizing and condemning abuse, educating congregants, validating and empowering women, and collaborating with community agencies to provide safety and basic assistance for victims. Adapted from the source document.

Battered Pets and Domestic Violence: Animal Abuse Reported by Women Experiencing Intimate Violence and by Nonabused Women

Author: Ascione, Frank R1; Weber, Claudia V; Thompson, Teresa M; Heath, John; Maruyama, Mika; Hayashi, Kentaro1 Psychology Department, Utah State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61393475?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women residing at domestic violence shelters (S group) were nearly 11 times more likely to report that their partner had hurt or killed pets than a comparison group of women who said they had not experienced intimate violence (NS group). Reports of threatened harm to pets were more than 4 times higher for the S group. Using the Conflict Tactics Scale, the authors demonstrated that severe physical violence was a significant predictor of pet abuse. The vast majority of shelter women described being emotionally close to their pets and distraught by the abuse family pets experienced. Children were often exposed to pet abuse, and most reported being distressed by these experiences. A substantial minority of S-group women reported that their concern for their pets' welfare prevented them from seeking shelter sooner. This seemed truer for women without children, who may have had stronger pet attachments. This obstacle to seeking safety should be addressed by domestic violence agencies.

A Comparison of the Police Response to Heterosexual Versus Same-Sex Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Pattavina, April1; Hirschel, David; Buzawa, Eve; Faggiani, Don; Bentley, Helen1 Department of Criminal Justice, University of Massachusetts Lowell

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61684061?accountid=14925

Abstract: It has been argued that the police do not respond to domestic calls involving same-sex couples in the same manner as they respond to calls involving heterosexual couples. A major problem facing researchers examining the police response to cases involving same-sex couples has been the lack of adequately sized samples. In this article, the authors utilize the 2000 National Incident Based Reporting System database, which contains 176,488 intimate partner assaults and intimidation incidents reported to 2,819 police departments in 19 states. The key issue examined is whether similar cases involving same-sex and heterosexual couples result in the same police response. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2007.]

Effects of Coordinated Services for Drug-Abusing Women Who Are Victims of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Bennett, Larry1; O'Brien, Patricia1 Jane Adams College of Social Work, University of Illinois, Chicago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61399310?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article summarizes outcomes from a demonstration project on collaboration between substance abuse and domestic violence agencies. Researchers recruited women seeking services for substance abuse or intimate partner violence at 1 of 6 participating agencies. Admitted women were both victims of domestic violence and abusing alcohol or drugs. Following an initial screening, participants were interviewed at program entry (n = 255) and again 4 to 6 months later (n = 128, 50%). Key outcomes were the number of days substances were used in the past 30 days, women's perceptions of harm from battering, and domestic violence self-efficacy. Results suggest participants used substances less frequently and experienced themselves as more efficacious following services, but they were also more fearful of the consequences of domestic violence. Repeated-measures MANOVA found that substance abuse days and domestic violence self-efficacy significantly contributed to the multivariate function. Implications for services for women with co-occurring substance abuse and domestic violence victimization are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2007.]

Discovering Strengths and Competencies in Female Domestic Violence Survivors: An Application of Roberts' Continuum of the Duration and Severity of Woman Battering

Author: Lee, Mo-Yee11 College of Social Work, The Ohio State University, 325W Stillman, 1947 College Road, Columbus, OH 43210 lee.355@osu.edu

Abstract: This paper describes a solution-focused approach for treating domestic violence female survivors and discusses the implications of Roberts' Continuum of Duration and Severity of Women Battering for therapists and researchers working within a solution-focused frame. Building on a strengths perspective, a solution-focused approach holds a person accountable for solutions instead of focusing on problems. The ultimate goal of the therapy is to provide a therapeutic context for domestic violence female survivors to rediscover and reconnect with their own resourcefulness in resisting, avoiding, escaping, and fighting against the abuse, develop a vision of a life free of violence, and empower women to re-experience their personal power in bringing positive changes to their lives.

Dating violence among emancipating foster youth

Author: Jonson-Reid, Melissa1; Scott, Lionel D, Jr; McMillen, J Curtis; Edmond, Tonya1 Washington University in St Louis, United States email: jonsonrd@wustl.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61418233?accountid=14925

Abstract: Youth emancipating from foster care have been found to be at higher risk for many adverse outcomes. Only one prior published study exists, however, about the dating violence experiences of foster youth. Asking similar questions about dating violence, this study attempted to replicate the prior findings regarding prevalence and to explore associations between foster care placement history, maltreatment history and mental health/stance abuse and self-reported dating violence. The youth reported a higher prevalence of dating violence than found in studies of the general youth population. Self-reported PTSD symptoms and drug use were associated with higher likelihood of dating violence victimization. The majority of youth self-reporting as dating violence perpetrators also self-reported as victims. Implications for research and practice are discussed. [Copyright 2006 Elsevier B.V.]

Letting them get away with it: Fathers, domestic violence and child welfare

Author: Featherstone, Brid1; Peckover, Sue1 Dept Social Sciences & Humanities, U Bradford, UK b.m.featherstonel@bradford.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61660191?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recent developments at policy, legislative and practice levels have led to the mainstreaming of domestic violence as a child welfare issue. However, research evidence would suggest that familiar and well established tensions in service provision to women and children continue to be recycled. Moreover, there remains a central dichotomy in relation to men. Constructed as perpetrators or offenders, their identities as fathers remain invisible with serious consequences for the development of policies and practices which engage with them as 'domestically violent fathers'. The discursive removal of violent men from the category of father or indeed parent needs addressing in order to support women and children, but also to offer possibilities for men to develop non-violent parenting and partnering relationship patterns.

Domestic Violence against Women in Nepal

Author: Paudel, Giridhari Sharma11 Giridhari Sharma Paudel, Program Director, Family Planning Association of Nepal, Central Office Harihar Bhavan, Laitpur, PO Box 486, Kathmandu, Nepal, fpan@mail.com.np

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810445589?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article aims to explore the phenomenon of women experiencing gender-based violence (GBV) at home, strategies adopted by women to manage GBV; knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) among health service providers (HSPs) and law enforcers to support GBV victims and to recommend appropriate policy and program initiatives for combating GBV in Nepal. GBV is an attitudinal problem of men towards women in Nepal. Men always feel superior to women and try to keep them subservient and commit violence if women are not able to understand their sentiments and act accordingly for pleasing them and performing their reproductive and productive roles, including household chores. One-third (35 percent) of women in Nepal experience GBV at home, although most violence is unreported and unrecorded in informal or formal institutions. Psychological violence was found to be high, followed by physical, economic and sexual violence. The main reasons for perpetuating violence against women are the low educational status of women, bringing less dowry at the time of marriage, no control over resources by women and low educational status of the perpetuators. Promulgating a law to criminalize GBV perpetrators and the formulation and implementation of educational and training programs to reduce GBV are immediate needs of the country.

Typologies of Adolescent Dating Violence. Identifying Typologies of Adolescent Dating Violence Perpetration

Author: Foshee, Vangie A1; Bauman, Karl E; Linder, Fletcher; Rice, Jennifer; Wilcher, Rose1 University of North Carolina

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809502073?accountid=14925

Abstract: Acts scales, the most common way of measuring partner violence, have been criticized for being too simplistic to capture the complexities of partner violence. An alternative measurement approach is to use typologies that consider various aspects of context. In this study, the authors identified typologies of dating violence perpetration by adolescents. They conducted in-depth interviews with 116 girls and boys previously identified by an acts scale as perpetrators of dating violence. They provided narrative descriptions of their dating violence acts. For boys and girls, many acts considered violent by the acts scale were subsequently recanted or described as nonviolent. From the narratives, they identified four types of female perpetration that were distinguished by motives, precipitating events, and the abuse history of the partners. One type of perpetration accounted for most acts by boys. The findings are discussed relative to dating violence measurement, prevention and treatment, and development of theory.

Associations of Dating Violence Victimization with Lifetime Participation, Co-Occurrence, and Early Initiation of Risk Behaviors among U.S. High School Students

Author: Eaton, Danice K1; Davis, Kristen S; Barrios, Lisa; Brener, Nancy D; Noonan, Rita K1 Division of Adolescent and School Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61692786?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the association of victimization in a physically violent dating relationship with risk behaviors, age of risk behavior initiation, and co-occurrence of risk behaviors among students in grades 9 through 12 in the United States. Data were from the 2003 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). Nearly 9% of students reported experiencing dating violence victimization. Dating violence victimization was associated with alcohol use, marijuana use, and having ever had sexual intercourse among female students and having ever had sexual intercourse among male students. Dating violence victimization also was associated with early initiation of alcohol use among female students. The odds of dating violence victimization increased as the number of risk behaviors increased and as the number of lifetime sexual partners increased. These risk behavior patterns should serve as warning signs of elevated risk for dating violence victimization and may be helpful in identifying adolescents who could benefit from targeted, preventive interventions.

Intimate Partner Violence During Pregnancy and Mothers' Child Abuse Potential

Author: Casanueva, Cecilia E1; Martin, Sandra L1 Department of Maternal and Child Health, CB #7445, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7445

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61666452?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research examines whether women who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy have a higher child abuse potential than women who have not experienced IPV. Data were analyzed from a longitudinal investigation of WV during pregnancy. This study recruited 88 pregnant women during prenatal care and followed them for 1 1/2 years. IPV was assessed using the Conflict Tactics Scale 2 (CTS2). The woman's potential for child abuse was assessed using the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI). There was a significant positive association between IPV and child abuse potential scores (p = .003), even after controlling for socio-demographics. The odds of having a high level of child abuse potential were 3 times greater for women who were victims of IPV compared to non-victims. Higher child abuse potential scores of the victimized women resulted mainly from the Distress and Problems with Others CAPI scales.

Women's Employment Status, Coercive Control, and Intimate Partner Violence in Mexico

Abstract: Findings from previous studies examining the relation between women's employment and the risk of intimate partner violence have been mixed. Some studies find greater violence toward women who are employed, whereas others find the opposite relation or no relation at all. I propose a new framework in which a woman's employment status and her risk of violent victimization are both influenced by the level of control exercised by her partner. Controlling men will actively prevent women from working and are also more likely to physically harm their partners. Using a statistical model in which the effect of omitted characteristics on women's employment and their risk of violence are allowed to be correlated reverses the estimated association between employment and violence. The final results show that employment reduces women's risk of violence. Data for the study are drawn from a sample of over 30,000 Mexican women in intimate relationships. The findings have broad implications given the increase in female labor force participation in many parts of the world. Adapted from the source document.

At the Crossroads and in the Crosshairs: Social Welfare Policy and Low-Income Womens Vulnerability to Domestic Violence

Author: Purvin, Diane M11 Wellesley Centers for Women, Wellesley College, 106 Central Street, Wellesley, MA 02481 E-mail: dpurvin@wellesley.edu

Abstract: Although research and social policy on domestic violence and poverty have largely focused on factors linked to welfare reform policy goals, low-income abused women have a broader set of needs for which they turn to the state for assistance. Using ethnographic data, I explore the impact of abused mothers interactions with an array of social welfare policy systems on their ability to protect themselves and their children from domestic violence. Analysis of interview and observational data found that distinctions between positive and negative influences on vulnerability to domestic violence were not clear-cut. Policies that provided protection and security to some placed others at increased risk, some policies mitigated the risk of further abuse for participants at the same time that other policies exacerbated their risk. Findings identify some current policy successes and failures, highlight the important role played by frontline workers, and demonstrate the importance of expanding the focus of research in this area beyond welfare and employment policies and outcomes to include the range of structural forces affecting family life in low-income communities. Drawing on the analyses and findings, I discuss ways in which social policy might be made more responsive to abused women and better ensure the safety and security of our most vulnerable families. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Dowry: Evidence from a South Indian Village

Author: Srinivasan, Sharada1; Bedi, Arjun S1 Institute of Social Studies, The Hague, The Netherlands

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61673079?accountid=14925

Abstract: In recent years the practice of dowry has witnessed sharp changes in south India. Dowry has become an all caste/class phenomenon and average dowry payments have risen. These changes have been associated with several negative consequences for women, including their survival. Despite these consequences the practice of dowry continues unabated. Based on data from a south Indian village, this paper examines the link between dowry and domestic violence. We argue that larger dowries reduce marital violence by increasing the economic resources of the marital household, enhancing the social status of the groom and his family, and serving as an asset over which the woman enjoys relatively more control. While women with generous dowries may benefit, a continued upward spiral in dowry expectations will exacerbate daughter aversion and may fuel sex selective abortion and female infanticide.

Child and partner abuse: Self-reported prevalence and attitudes in the north of Portugal

Author: Machado, Carla1; Goncalves, Miguel; Matos, Marlene; Dias, Ana Rita1 Departamento de Psicologia, Universidade do Minho, 4710-057 Braga, Portugal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61685095?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objectives To determine the self-reported prevalence of child and partner physical and emotional abuse in the north of Portugal and to investigate attitudes about these forms of family violence. Methods Data were collected by questionnaire from a representative sample of parents in two-parent families with children under the age of 18 years. A total of 2,391 parents participated (1,057 males), aged 20-67 years. Four questionnaires were used, one behavioral and one attitudinal, for each of the forms of abuse: child and partner. Results At least one act of emotional or physical abuse towards a child during the previous year was reported by 25.9% of participants (12.3% reported physically abusive and 22.4% emotionally abusive acts). Abuse of a partner was reported by 26.2% of participants; at least one act of physical abuse during the previous year was reported by 12% and of emotional abuse by 23.7%. The attitudinal data, however, showed general disapproval of the use of violence, both for disciplining children and within marital relationships. The degree of self-reported support for physical punishment was higher in participants who reported using abusive behavior. Females more commonly reported acts of child abuse, and males reported acts of partner abuse. Both forms of self-reported abuse showed an association with low educational and socio-economic status. Conclusions This is the first study in Portugal to analyze family violence through self-report using a representative sample. The findings indicate that child and partner abuse constitute a significant problem in the region of northern Portugal. The discrepancy between the self-reported behavioral and attitudinal data may reflect conflicts in Portuguese society, which is undergoing substantial cultural changes.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Anger, and Partner Abuse Among Vietnam Combat Veterans

Author: Taft, Casey T1; Street, Amy E; Marshall, Amy D; Dowdall, Deborah J; Riggs, David S1 Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System (116B-20, 150 South Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02130 casey.taft@va.gov

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61675464?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors examined interrelationships among posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology, anger, and partner abuse perpetration among a sample of 60 combat veterans. Compared with PTSD-negative participants, PTSD-positive participants reported higher state anger across time and neutral and trauma prime conditions and higher anger reactivity during the trauma prime condition. PTSD-positive participants also exhibited more anger reactivity during the trauma prime than during the neutral condition. The same pattern of results was not found for anxiety reactivity during trauma memory activation. PTSD symptoms were associated with physical assault and psychological aggression perpetration, and trait anger mediated these relationships. Findings indicate a heightened anger response among PTSD-positive veterans and suggest the salience of dispositional components of anger in abuse perpetration in this population.

Screening for Intimate Partner Violence. The Impact of Screener and Screening Environment on Victim Comfort

Author: Thackeray, Jonathan1; Stelzner, Sarah; Downs, Stephen M; Miller, Carleen1 Mayerson Center for Safe and Healthy Children, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Ohio

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809363938?accountid=14925

Abstract: The barriers that professionals face when screening victims for intimate partner violence (IPV) are well studied. The specific barriers that victims face however when being screened are not. The authors sought to identify characteristics of the screener and screening environment that make a victim feel more or less comfortable when disclosing a history of IPV. One hundred forty self-reported female victims of IPV completed a survey regarding their experiences with screening and degree of comfort with certain traits of the screener and the screening environment. Women demonstrated a preference to be screened by a woman, someone of the same race, a provider aged 30 to 50 years, and without anyone else present. Screeners should be aware of characteristics that impact victim comfort and should provide multiple opportunities for women to disclose IPV in a safe, respectful, and culturally effective environment.

Intimate Partner Violence Within a Cohort of Pacific Mothers Living in New Zealand

Author: Paterson, Janis1; Feehan, Michael; Butler, Sarnia; Williams, Maynard; Cowley-Malcolm, Esther Tumama1 Auckland University of Technology

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809353309?accountid=14925

Abstract: Maternal reports of intimate partner violence (IPV) were obtained from a cohort of Pacific mothers living in New Zealand. The Conflict Tactics Scale was completed by 1,095 women who had given birth in the past 12 months, and who were married or living with a partner as married. The 12-month prevalence of 'victimization' through verbal aggression was 77%, 21% for 'minor' physical violence, and 11% for 'severe' physical violence. The 12-month prevalence of 'perpetration' of verbal aggression against a partner was 90%, 35% for 'minor' physical violence, and 19% for 'severe' violence towards their partner. The experience of social inequality and acculturation are associated with IPV, albeit differentially across the experience of victimization and perpetration. Factors significantly associated with victimization are ethnicity, maternal education, social marital status and household income. Factors significantly associated with perpetration are ethnicity, cultural alignment, maternal birthplace and alcohol consumption since the birth of the child.

Abstract: This study aims to explore the relationship between perceived neighborhood social disorder and attitudes toward reporting domestic violence against women. Data from a national representative sample (N = 14,994) of Spaniards 18 years old and older were used. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that perceived neighborhood social disorder is negatively associated with attitudes toward reporting domestic violence against women. These results take into account the potential confounding effects of gender, age, socioeconomic status, perceived frequency of domestic violence against women, and size of city on reporting attitudes. Findings support the idea that to reduce and prevent domestic violence against women, it is also important to address those conditions leading to mistrust between people and diminished social control such as concentrated disadvantage and disorder.

An Exploratory Study of Women Arrested for Intimate Partner Violence: Violent Women or Violent Resistance?

Author: Muftic, Lisa R1; Bouffard, Jeffrey A; Bouffard, Leana Allen1 Department of Criminal Justice, University of North Texas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61668932?accountid=14925

Abstract: With the advent of mandatory and pro-arrest laws for incidents of intimate partner violence, there has been an increase in the number of women arrested for domestic violence. Several explanations are posed in the literature that attempt to explain such a rise, including the hypothesis that women are being arrested not for offensive violence but rather for defensive violence. Few studies, however, have used empirical data to support such arguments. This exploratory study examines the characteristics of women arrested for intimate personal violence. Particular attention is paid to women arrested with their partner (i.e., dual arrestees) and the contextual characteristics of dual arrestee incidents. Important differences are uncovered in the context and consequences of arrest for dual arrestees (n = 21) compared to women arrested alone as the offender (n = 49). Implications of these findings and further research directions are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2007.]

Perceptions of Relationship Violence: A Youth Perspective

Author: Pretorius, B M L1; Terblanche, S S; Tshiwula, J L1 Dept Social Development Professions, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61373890?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article seeks to privilege a youth perspective on relationship violence, given the critique that existing programmes tend to represent adult views. By representing youth perspectives, the article makes a specific contribution to social work research that places the spotlight on preventive interventions that are more aligned to actual perceptions of youth. The qualitative study was conducted as part of a three-phase doctoral study and focuses on a specific theme regarding 'youth perceptions of relationship violence' that emerged during the thematic analysis of 58 youth narratives. From the data it emerged that youths, based on direct or vicarious experiences, are unsure of boundaries in relation to the ambiguities and contradictions they perceive as being inherent in violence within relationship spaces. It is recommended that the perceptions articulated by youths themselves can be used as markers to inform development of effective programmes for relationship violence prevention. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Increased Lifetime Risk of Sexually Transmitted Infection Among Women in Ukraine

Author: Dude, Annie

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61680749?accountid=14925

Abstract: Population-based, cross-sectional data from 3,587 ever-married Ukrainian women aged 17-44 are used to examine the association between physical violence perpetrated by a sexual partner (defined as kicking, hitting, slapping, pushing, or attacking with a weapon) and sexual health knowledge, sexual behavior, and the likelihood of reporting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Such violence, both past and recent, is found to be associated with increased lifetime risk of acquiring an STI. Women who have been abused by a sexual partner, whether in the past 12 months or less recently, are significantly less likely to use condoms currently, and are significantly more likely to report having had multiple sexual partners in the past year. Findings from the study indicate that physical violence perpetrated by a sexual partner is associated with risky sexual behaviors and increased risk of sexually transmitted infection in Ukraine, and may constitute a barrier to prevention of HIV/STI transmission. Adapted from the source document.

Night Terrors: Women's Experiences of (Not) Sleeping Where There Is Domestic Violence

Author: Lowe, Pam1; Humphreys, Cathy; Williams, Simon J1 School of Languages and Social Sciences, Aston University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61641916?accountid=14925

Abstract: The management of sleep is embedded within the social context of individuals' lives. This article is based on an exploratory study using focus groups of the sleep problems encountered by 17 women survivors of domestic violence. It argues that fear becomes the organizing framework for the management of sleep and illustrates how this takes place both while living with the perpetrators of violence and after the women have been rehoused. It argues that sleep deprivation is a method used by the perpetrators to exert control over women and that this has long-term implications for women's physical and mental health.

Experiences With Intimate Partner Violence Among Latina Women

Author: Hazen, Andrea L1; Soriano, Fernando I1 Child and Adolescent Services Research Center, San Diego Children's Hospital and Health Center

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61412268?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined experiences with intimate partner violence in 292 Latina women classified as U.S. born, immigrant, or migrant-seasonal workers. High lifetime rates of violence were found, with 33.9% reporting physical violence, 20.9% reporting sexual coercion, and 82.5% reporting psychological aggression. Rates of violence in the preceding year were also high, with 18.5% experiencing physical violence, 14.4% experiencing sexual coercion, and 72.6% experiencing psychological aggression. Participants' marital status and partners' substance use were associated with victimization. The present findings suggest the need for screening for intimate partner violence and associated risk factors in settings that serve Latina women.

In Their Own Voices: A Qualitative Study of Women's Risk for Intimate Partner Violence and HIV in South Africa

Author: Fox, Ashley M1; Jackson, Sharon S; Hansen, Nathan B; Gasa, Nolwazi; Crewe, Mary; Sikkema, Kathleen J1 Department of Sociomedical Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388941?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study qualitatively examines the intersections of risk for intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV infection in South Africa. Eighteen women seeking services for relationship violence were asked semistructured questions regarding their abusive experiences and HIV risk. Participants had experienced myriad forms of abuse, which reinforced each other to create a climate that sustained abuse and multiplied HIV risk. Male partners having multiple concurrent sexual relationships, and poor relationship communication compounded female vulnerability to HIV and abuse. A social environment of silence, male power, and economic constraints enabled abuse to continue. "Breaking the silence" and women's empowerment were suggested solutions.

A Specialized Domestic Violence Court in South Carolina: An Example of Procedural Justice for Victims and Defendants

Author: Gover, Angela R1; Brank, Eve M; MacDonald, John M1 Graduate School of Public Affairs, University of Colorado, Denver

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61660222?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current research details interviews with 50 victims and 50 defendants who participated in a specialized criminal domestic violence court in Lexington County, South Carolina. These victims and defendants indicated satisfaction with their court experiences, thought the process allowed them to voice their views, felt they were treated with respect, and were generally satisfied with the outcome of their cases. Court observations and interviews with court personnel confirmed that this court has successfully incorporated victims and defendants into the decision-making process while also providing a fair system to address the issue of violence against women.

Teaching Social Work Students to Resolve Ethical Dilemmas in Domestic Violence

Author: Bent-Goodley, Tricia B11 MSW, Associate Professor, Howard University School of Social Work, Washington, DC, 20059

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61404148?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines findings from three focus groups conducted about resolving ethical dilemmas in the area of domestic violence. The study's findings point to the need to increase content on domestic violence throughout the social work curriculum and provide educational opportunities for field instructors and local professionals. Helping students engage in values clarification and self-assessment regarding domestic violence is also key to helping them resolve ethical dilemmas in this area of practice. Faculty teaching these courses should be prepared to spend more time responding to assignments and serving as a resource to students, field instructors, and local professionals. Finally, there are steps that can be taken to help social workers be more responsive and resolve ethical dilemmas related to domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

Feminist Therapy: Its Use and Implications for South Asian Immigrant Survivors of Domestic Violence

Abstract: Feminist therapy is a compelling framework to use with women who are survivors of domestic violence due to its focus on power and oppression in women's lives. However, feminist frameworks have been criticized for their lack of attention to the experiences of diverse groups of women, a shortcoming that multicultural frameworks have attempted to address. Very little scholarship exists on the use of feminist therapy with South Asian women, and with Asian American women in general, particularly on its use with domestic violence survivors. The work that does exist suggests that Asian values are in contrast with the principles of feminist therapy for a variety of reasons. Using interviews with practitioners who work with battered South Asian women, this paper suggests that practitioners enact feminist and multicultural principles in their work, by their attention to socio-cultural context, their focus on women's empowerment and voicing women's lived experiences, and their consideration of the dynamics of the therapeutic relationship. They hold patriarchy in its complexity accountable for domestic violence in the community. Although the term 'feminist' was rarely used, in contrast to work that suggests that Asian women would not identify with self-based models of therapy, practitioners articulated that women do benefit from insight-based therapy, and attempted to work against cultural stereotypes that they often see functionally used to evade addressing trauma and grief.

Psychosocial Factors Associated With Reports Of Physical Dating Violence Among U.S. Adolescent Females

Author: Howard, Donna E1; Wang, Min Qi; Yan, Fang1 Department of Public and Community Health CHHP, 2387 Valley Drive, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742 dhoward1@umd.edu

Abstract: The present study, based upon the national 2005 Youth Risk Behavior Survey of U.S. high school students, provides the most current and representative data on dating violence among adolescent females (N = 7,179). The dependent variable was physical dating violence. The independent variables included four dimensions: violence, suicide, substance use, and sexual risk behavior. Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), were examined followed by multivariate logistic regression analyses, which included all significant independent variables from the bivariate analyses. Adjusted OR and 95% CI were computed to assess the significance of the relationships. In terms of prevalence, 10.3% of female adolescents reported experiencing physical dating violence. Black girls (OR = 1.47) and girls who reported sad/hopeless feelings (OR = 1.42) considered suicide (OR = 1.55), engaged in physical fighting (OR = 2.17), had recent sexual partners (OR = 2.10), or had unprotected sexual intercourse (OR = 1.70) were more likely to report physical dating violence. These findings suggest dating violence against adolescent females is widespread and associated with a host of other risk factors that deserve further attention through longitudinal research and intervention efforts.

Tomorrow's Players Under Occupation: An Analysis of the Association of Political Violent with Psychological Functioning and Domestic Violence, among Palestinian Youth

Author: Al-Krenawi, Alean; Graham, John R; Sehwail, Mahmud A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397302?accountid=14925

Abstract: A 2005 survey of 2,328 youth (ages 12 to 18) in the West Bank, Palestine, revealed an association between exposure to politically violent events, domestic violence, and school violence and with psychological symptomatology. Results also found associations between family violence, family economic status, and psychological symptomatology. Respondents reported low levels of family functioning. Data revealed some geographic variability in experiences of politically violent events, domestic violence, school violence, and psychological symptomatology. Implications for practice are discussed.

Longitudinal Helpseeking Patterns among Victims of Intimate Partner Violence: The Relationship between Legal and Extralegal Services

Author: Cattaneo, Lauren Bennett; Stuewig, Jeffrey; Goodman, Lisa A; Kaltman, Stacey; Dutton, Mary Ann

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61385870?accountid=14925

Abstract: Current theory assumes that intimate partner violence (IPV) victims' helpseeking is a process that unfolds over time rather than a one-time event, but this assumption has never been explored with longitudinal data. This study describes the pattern of formal helpseeking efforts in a sample of 406 IPV victims over the course of a year. Further, we explore the relationship between legal and extralegal helpseeking, reflecting current controversy over how these two types of interventions should be coordinated. We constructed and tested latent growth curve models using structural equation modeling to explore helpseeking patterns, and found that repeated helpseeking was common, with 80% seeking additional help during follow-up. Results also showed that legal and extralegal helpseeking decreased together over time, and that this similarity in pattern can best be described as a connection between behaviors that are similarly influenced by time-specific events like re-abuse, rather than a connection between overarching trajectories. Results suggest that time varying factors are more important than stable characteristics in predicting helpseeking patterns, and support coordination through a one-stop-shopping model rather than primarily through referral systems.

Policy Activism on a 'Wicked Issue': The Building of Australian Feminist Policy on Domestic Violence in the 1970s

Author: Ramsay, Janet11 Macquarie U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61688542?accountid=14925

Abstract: Looks back to what was called a watershed moment in Australian feminism, the beginning of the political process of recognizing domestic violence and being acted upon in the Australian legal system. This began with the coming together of one hundred and thirty-eight women to speak publicly about the physical and sexual cruelty they had to endure at the hands of their lovers down the years, and to shortly-after found a women's shelter that led the way to others like it. The issue of what would later be dubbed "domestic violence" was, at the time, quite ignored, surprisingly to the author, who asks why this issue took so long to be spoken of, and seeks to examine the factors leading up to the point of recognition to raise the issue at last. This problem initially was seen as a private matter twixt the couple only, and sometimes a therapist, before public consciousness raised the matter to legal one which, however, is still a somewhat ongoing battle for women due to gender politics in which politicos find the matter too messy to wish to deal with, even calling it "the wicked issue." Part of bringing the issue to head was via feminists gaining sophistication in policy cycle and activism, and continually speaking out. References. S. Fullmer

Family-Based Justice In The Sentencing Of Domestic Violence

Author: Dinovitzer, Ronit1; Dawson, Myrna1 Department of Sociology, University of Toronto, 725 Spadina Avenue Toronto, Ontario M5S 2J4, Canada ronit.dinovitzer@utoronto.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61700120?accountid=14925

Abstract: While historical research has noted the importance of the 'family' in criminal justice, recent empirical work has tended to neglect the emphasis placed on the family in the criminal process. Drawing on Daly's work on familial justice, this paper investigates the role of the family in the sentencing of offenders in a specialized domestic violence court. We examine both the likelihood of incarceration and the determinants of sentence length, and find that conceptions of the family continue to have an important influence on these criminal process outcomes. In cases in which the victim has suffered serious injuries, offenders in intact relationships are more likely to be sentenced to jail yet, at the same time, when incarcerated, these offenders receive shorter sentences. Thus, even as researchers are documenting broader shifts away from the promotion of substantive values through the criminal process, the current study suggests the continued relevance of 'family-based justice' in the sanctioning of offenders, so that moral imperatives continue to intersect with the actuarial logic of modern penal practices.

Evaluating Domestic Violence Initiatives

Author: Parmar, Alpa1; Sampson, Alice1 Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge, Sidgwick Avenue, Cambridge, CB3 9DT

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61656698?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper critiques the approach of identifying 'best practice' projects and discusses the problem with simply transferring projects into different contexts. The argument is illustrated by explaining the evaluation process of three domestic violence projects which all had the same aim, which was to reduce domestic violence. The evaluated projects all delivered advocacy programmes and were located in disadvantaged areas in the United Kingdom. A more suitable evaluation approach is proposed whereby practice principles are transferred rather than projects and this is presented in the form of a 'practice model'.

Children at Risk from Domestic Violence and their Educational Attainment: Perspectives of Education Welfare Officers, Social Workers and Teachers

Author: Byrne, Dorothy1; Taylor, Brian1 Belfast Education & Library Board

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61421856?accountid=14925

Abstract: Children who witness domestic violence may have impaired educational attainment as well as facing other challenges such as struggles with self-esteem and forming relationships. This qualitative study set in Northern Ireland explored the perceptions of Education Welfare Officers, child protection social workers and teachers in post-primary schools regarding the impact of domestic violence on schooling and educational attainment, and of service responses to this. The survey used semi-structured interviews with four professionals in each of the above categories. Findings confirmed the major effect that domestic violence can have on children's schooling and relationships. Two typical types of responses by children were identified: those who became quiet and withdrawn, and those who became loud and aggressive. There seemed to have been progress in terms of professional understanding and service responses regarding domestic violence, but there seemed to be limited structured cooperation between the professional groups in addressing the effects of domestic violence on children. Sharing of information is hindered by confidentiality issues, some of which might be addressed by integrated teams of appropriate professionals.

What Criteria Do Child Protective Services Investigators Use to Substantiate Exposure to Domestic Violence?

Author: Coohey, Carol11 School of Social Work, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61429026?accountid=14925

Abstract: The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether child protective services investigators apply a recognizable set of criteria to substantiate batterers and victims of battering for exposing their children to domestic violence. Although domestic violence occurred in 35% of the 1,248 substantiated incidents of child maltreatment, only 31 (7.1%) couples were investigated for exposing a child to domestic violence or failing to protect a child from domestic violence. All of the batterers investigated and in the caregiver role when their children were exposed to domestic violence were substantiated. The unsubstantiated victims of battering tended to use more protective behaviors (M=3.82) than the substantiated victims (M=2.OO), yet, at the case level, using more than one protective behavior did not seem to be a criterion used to substantiate the victims. Instead, it appears that investigators were discriminating between those protective behaviors by the victims that ended contact between the batterers and the children-for a substantial amount of time-and those that did not in both the substantiation and removal decision. Key issues related to applying criteria in incidents involving domestic violence are discussed along with recommendations to further refine and document them. Adapted from the source document.

Assessing child exposure to adult domestic violence

Author: Edleson, Jeffrey L1; Ellerton, Amanda L; Seagren, Ellen A; Kirchberg, Staci L; Schmidt, Sarah O; Ambrose, Amirthini T1 MINCAVA, University of Minnesota School of Social Work, 105 Peters Hall, 1404 Gortner Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55108, United States jedleson@umn.edu

Abstract: The emerging interest in children's exposure to adult domestic violence has brought about calls for better methods to assess such exposure. Currently no assessment tools exist that adequately measure the diversity of children's experiences with domestic violence. In this article we identify several factors affecting children's experiences and consequent outcomes, including concurrent victimization and various risk and protective factors. We then review several measures that include at least one question regarding adult domestic violence and that assess child exposure to and/or perception of domestic violence. We conclude that existing measures do not comprehensively identify factors related to child exposure and thus call for the development of new tools that more thoroughly and accurately assess child exposure to adult domestic violence.

The Collaboration Between Welfare and Advocacy Organizations: Learning From the Experiences of Domestic Violence Survivors

Author: Postmus, Judy L1; Hahn, Sur Ah1 Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, School of Social Work, 536 George Street, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 postmus@rci.rutgers.edu

Abstract: The intertwined relationship between poverty and violence, especially in the lives of women on welfare, has been receiving critical attention since welfare reform. The Family Violence Option (FVO), an amendment to the Personal Responsibility and Work Reconciliation Act of 1996, gives states the flexibility to offer more time for battered women to seek safety. Kansas created the Orientation, Assessment, Referral, and Safety (OARS) program, in which the state's welfare system contracts services with advocacy organizations that provide on-site services for women who qualify to participate under the FVO. This study explored the interagency collaboration model used in Kansas by talking directly with domestic violence survivors about their experiences. The results from this study challenge practitioners to think differently about collaboration to meet the needs of domestic violence survivors on welfare. Adapted from the source document.

An Empirical Test of Feminist Theory and Research. The Effect of Heterogeneous Gender-Role Attitudes on Perceptions of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Herzog, Sergio11 Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810428991?accountid=14925

Abstract: Feminist empirical research, which consistently shows a positive relationship between traditional gender-role attitudes toward women and tolerant perceptions of male violence against intimate female partners, ignores the heterogeneity of these attitudes. New scholarship reveals that they are not necessarily blatant, hostile, and negative but are more complex, involving covertly and even overtly benevolent references to women. A sample of Israelis were asked to evaluate the seriousness of and most appropriate punishment for hypothetical and multidimensional crime scenarios while their differing kinds of traditional gender-role attitudes toward women were assessed. Perceptions varied considerably as a function of the gender-role scale applied and respondents' scores.

Wife Abuse in Tajikistan

Author: Haarr, Robin N11 Eastern Kentucky University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810429189?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Tajikistan, wife abuse is a significant problem that has received virtually no attention from researchers or the government of Tajikistan. This descriptive study seeks to understand women's approval of wife abuse and the extent of wife abuse in Tajik women's lives. Four hundred women in three districts of Khatlon Oblast participated in this general population survey. Overall, most women approved of wife abuse by one's husband and/or mother-in-law and maintained that there were a wide range of so-called justifiable circumstances for wife abuse, particularly for behaviors that transgress expectations. A significant proportion of women also reported experiencing physical and sexual violence from their husbands, and a small proportion of women reported experiencing physical violence from their mothers-in-law. The study's implications for practice and future research on issues of wife abuse in Tajikistan are discussed.

Domestic Violence: A Global Perspective

Author: Fawcett, Barbara11 U Sydney

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61396016?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic Violence defined as intimate partner violence is differentially understood & responded to within & between countries & it frequently falls short of being seen as a human rights issue which requires government, community & professional responses. This article explores definitions & explanations of domestic violence that have been put forward & considers the associations that have been made between violence & abuse. It also reviews multi-country links between women's health & domestic violence & examines controversial issues surrounding fathers who have been domestically violent. As part of the discussion, professional responsibility & responses are also appraised. It is argued that domestic violence is intrinsically related to gendered power imbalances which have different manifestations in different social & cultural contexts. However the view that violence is inevitable in certain situations is challenged. The ethical imperative of zero tolerance is emphasized, but further research in relation to how gendered power imbalances foster intimate partner violence in some contexts but not in others & how this can be explored in ways which move the discussion away from pathologizing explanations, is highlighted as an area for further investigation. Adapted from the source document.

Personal History Dynamics of Dating Violence Among Israeli Students

Author: Goussinsky, Ruhama1; Yassour-Borochowitz, Dalit1 Department of Sociology & Human Services, Emek Yezreel College, Afula, 19300, Israel goussinsky@intradco.com

Abstract: The purpose of the present study is to examine the relationship between dating violence and childhood experiences of aggression. The study specifically examines which of the following four variables is most strongly linked with the probability of partner assault in a current relationship: violence socialization, sexual abuse history, parental neglect, or childhood deviant behavior. Four hundred sixty-five Israeli undergraduate students participated in the study. The revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2) was used to measure current violence. Personal history variables were taken from a large-scale questionnaire, the Personal and Relationships Profile (PRP). The results indicate that after controlling for the effect of other historical and demographic variables, the only historical factor which is significantly associated with partner assault is childhood deviant behavior. However, hierarchical regression analysis reveals that childhood deviant behavior is best explained by the three other types of childhood experiences, in addition to gender (male), nationality (non-Jewish) and religiousness (non-religious). We also found that while the probability of violence increases the longer the relationship lasts, it decreases in marital relationships and cohabitation. The implications of the findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Variations in Behavior Problems of Preschoolers Exposed to Domestic Violence: The Role of Mothers' Attunement to Children's Emotional Experiences

Author: Johnson, Vanessa K1; Lieberman, Alicia F1 Department of Psychology, West Chester University, West Chester, PA 19383, USA vjohnson@wcupa.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61665604?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to identify aspects of family relationships that may protect young children from the pathogenic effects of family violence. Using a sample of 30 preschool-age children whose mothers were physically abused by a partner, we investigated the associations between children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and: (1) the quality of the mother-child relationship, and (2) mothers' attunement to their child's sad and angry emotions. Results indicated that clinician ratings of the mother-child relationship, and mothers' attunement to their child's experience of emotion each made a unique contribution to the prediction of children's externalizing behavior. These relationships remained robust, even after taking the severity of domestic violence reported by mothers into consideration. Maternal attunement, however, did not mediate the relationship between marital conflict and children's behavior problems. No significant link was found between children's internalizing behavior and maternal attunement to their children's sadness and anger. Additional findings suggested that mothers with a PTSD diagnosis tended to be less attuned to their child's experience of sadness. Adapted from the source document.

Assessing Readiness to Change among Perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence: Analysis of Two Self-report Measures

Author: Eckhardt, Christopher I1; Utschig, Angela C1 Department of Psychological Sciences, Purdue University, 703 3rd St., West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA eckhardt@purdue.edu

Abstract: Recent interest in the construct of motivation to change among male perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV) has led to development of two self-report measures of this construct: the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment for Domestic Violence (URICA-DV; Levesque et al. 2000) and the Safe at Home Inventory (SAH; Begun et al. 2003). We examined the internal structure of these instruments using confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses in a sample of 199 male IPV perpetrators waiting to begin court-mandated batterer intervention programs. Results indicated that the scales had adequate internal consistency. However, using confirmatory factor analyses, the hypothesized structural models of each instrument fit the data poorly. Subsequent models suggested by a series of exploratory factor analyses failed to improve model fit substantially for both scales. For the URICA-DV, a 3-factor model including items from the Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Action subscales fit the data adequately. No acceptable model fit could be found for the SAH. Intercorrelations among similar subscales across the two inventories suggested only a modest degree of intercorrelation (r's=0.16-0.52), and a factor structure more dependent on scale of origin than item latent content, suggesting that the scales assess different facets of the readiness to change construct. These results suggest that before the stages of change construct can be fully applied to the IPV area, more research and evaluation are needed on how to accurately assess abuser readiness to change.

Longitudinal Effects of Domestic Violence on Employment and Welfare Outcomes

Author: Lindhorst, Taryn1; Oxford, Monica; Gillmore, Mary Rogers1 University of Washington School of Social Work

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809351960?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study uses longitudinal data spanning 13 years from a study of 234 adolescent mothers to evaluate the effects of cumulative domestic violence on employment and welfare use before and after welfare reform. Domestic violence increased the odds of unemployment after welfare reform, but not before; domestic violence had no effect on welfare use during any time period. Psychological distress after welfare reform was associated with unemployment, but not with welfare outcomes. Thus, the authors found that the direct effect of domestic violence on unemployment is not mediated by concurrent level of psychological distress. The relationship of psychological distress to unemployment exists only for those with a history of domestic violence. Cumulative domestic violence can have negative effects on economic capacity many years after the violence occurs, suggesting that policymakers recognize the long-term nature of the impact of domestic violence on women's capacity to be economically self-reliant.

Family Violence In Asian Communities, Combining Research And Community Development

Author: Tse, Samson11 Centre for Asian Health Research and Evaluation, Social and Community Health, School of Population Health, Tamaki Campus, University of Auckland Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand, Phone: 64 9 3737599 ext 86097, Fax: 64 9 3035932

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61681355?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study aimed to begin to fill gaps in research on family violence in Asian communities in Aotearoa New Zealand, and increase understanding of what can be done to prevent its occurrence and reduce its impacts on families, relatives and friends. The study employed interviews with migrants from China, South Asia and South East Asia who used family violence services, key informant interviews with practitioners working in the family violence field, and focus groups with service users, practitioners and trainees. The study found the triggers for family violence within these New Zealand Asian communities related to difficulties in adjusting to living in a new country, in particular, finding suitable employment and experiencing financial hardship. Men's dominance in some Asian families was an issue, especially when men saw control over their wives as a last resort to protect their cultural values and traditions. The racism and discrimination some women experienced in this study, when they attempted to find paid jobs or solve their financial dependency issues, put women at extreme risk of abuse and violence. The barriers to preventing or dealing with family violence related to perceptions in the Asian communities researched that family violence is a private matter, and to the women's desire to keep the marriage/relationship intact and limited responsiveness.

FEMALE TACTICS AND STRATEGIES OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE: A STUDY OF INCIDENT REPORTS

Author: Ward, Russell E, Jr1; Muldoon, John P1 Department of Sociology, Francis Marion University, Florence, South Carolina, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61661419?accountid=14925

Abstract: Researchers have debated the extent to which females pursue violence against their male partners for purposes of enforcing or resisting control. In an effort to shed light on this important topic, we examined 43 incident reports of women who were court-referred to a batterer intervention program to explore how and why they engaged in intimate partner violence. Our analysis of the reports revealed that the most common tactic of physical violence was pushing and the most common tactic of psychological violence was intimidation. The motive to enforce was observed in the majority of the incident reports, while attempts to resist, retaliate, and punish occurred in about one third of the reports. We also found that female violence typically occurred in the contexts of anger and fear. The implications of our research for violence intervention programs are discussed.

Exploring the Perceptions of Domestic Violence Service Providers in Rural Localities

Author: Eastman, Brenda J1; Bunch, Shelia G; Williams, A Hamilton; Carawan, Lena W1 East Carolina University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61421735?accountid=14925

Abstract: This exploratory study uses a nonprobability purposive sample to investigate the perceptions of domestic violence service providers in rural regions of North Carolina and Virginia. Investigators gathered data incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data were retrieved through the development and distribution of a self-administered survey targeting service provider perceptions about the general public, consumers of services, self-perceptions, and perceptions related to inter- and intra-agency issues. Qualitative data were collected to provide further elaboration on the topic through the use of a focus group composed of rural service providers. The focus group was facilitated by the investigators. Findings identified deficits in public knowledge, agency resources, and community resources, and professional development as being the most problematic issues. Victims were perceived as having to face multiple issues and barriers when seeking services. Implications of these findings are discussed as well as the need for continued research efforts.

Screening for Intimate Partner Violence Within a Health Care Setting: A Systematic Review of the Literature

Author: Trabold, Nicole11 Doctoral Candidate, School of Social Work, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, 14260-1050 ntrabold@buffalo.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61412372?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this review is to present literature regarding intervention research on Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) screening. Articles were obtained by searching six databases and review of reference pages. Of the articles selected for this review, all measured disclosure rates of IPV screening and five addressed safety practices, one study included both screening and safety practices. Two studies evaluated advocacy's impact on safety and the level of violence. Five studies reported referral initiation to advocacy services. The results suggest that screening is effective in identifying IPV; however, a causal link between screening practices, increased safety practices, and decreased violence cannot be established. Practice and research implications for social work are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Loneliness and Intimate Partner Violence: Antecedents of Alienation of Abused Women

Author: Rokach, Ami11 The Institute for the Study and Treatment of Psychological Stress, Toronto, ON, M3H 4J9, Canada arokach@yorku.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61418690?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explored the perceived causes of loneliness of abused women. Eighty women, victims of domestic abuse, were compared with 84 women from the general population, who have had no history of abusive relationships. A 30-item-yes/no loneliness questionnaire was utilized in order to compare the causes of loneliness in the two samples. The factors that comprise the causes of loneliness are: Personal inadequacies, Developmental deficits, Unfulfilling intimate relationships, Relocation/significant separations, and Social marginality. Results confirmed the hypothesis that abused women, indeed, perceived the causes of their loneliness significantly differently than women in the general population do. The abused women scored significantly higher on all the subscales. Adapted from the source document.

A Model for Group Work Practice with Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Victims of Domestic Violence: A Qualitative Study

Author: Sweifach, Jay1; Heft-Laporte, Heidi1 Assistant Professor, Wurzweiler School of Social Work , Yeshiva University, New York, NY, 10033

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61420994?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Orthodox Jewish community has only recently acknowledged that religious practice and commitment does not make one immune to suffering from domestic violence. Effective therapeutic techniques for working with battered Orthodox women have only recently begun to emerge. This article focuses on the use of group work as an effective therapeutic modality for working with abused Orthodox Jewish women. This research highlights the insight, knowledge, and experience of practitioners who facilitate domestic violence groups, focusing on proficiencies and ethnic-sensitive practice strategies that are perceived to lead to successful outcomes. The application of ethnic-sensitive strategies is discussed to illustrate viable therapeutic considerations for working with this population. Implications and issues for educators and practitioners will be addressed. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This study investigated gender and age differences in the perceptions of dating violence using both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Focus groups were conducted to develop culturally appropriate questionnaires consisting of dating scenarios that may lead to dating violence. The participants were asked to provide their perceptions and behavioral reactions to the dating scenarios. The study found that young adolescent boys were significantly more likely to respond aggressively toward dating partners than were young adolescent girls, women, and men. These findings have implications for practitioners who are charged with preventing dating violence among adolescents, specifically boys. Key Words: age differences - dating violence - perceptions - sex differences. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2007.]

The Complexities of the Religious Response to Domestic Violence

Author: Pyles, Loretta11 Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana lorettapyles@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61403011?accountid=14925

Abstract: Drawing on data from a study conducted in Wyoming about the community response to domestic violence, this article focuses on an unanticipated finding: how religion is paradoxically both a source of assistance and a barrier to women surviving domestic violence. The results indicate that although religious institutions are a resource for emotional comfort and provide practical assistance, they may also perpetuate silence. The article concludes that many religious communities are not adequately equipped to respond to the problem of domestic violence in a way that is safe for women. Implications for social work, particularly for recent faith-based initiatives, are discussed. Key Words: charitable choice - domestic violence - faith-based initiatives - religion.

Domestic Violence Training Policies. Influence on Participation in Training and Awareness of Abuse

Author: Payne, Brian1; Carmody, Dianne Cyr; Plichta, Stacey; Vandecar-Burdin, Tancy1 Georgia State University, Atlanta

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811290796?accountid=14925

Abstract: Victims of domestic violence rely on various human services professionals for an assortment of needs. Consequently, professionals must be prepared to recognize the signs of domestic violence, the needs of victims, and strategies to serve victims effectively. It is believed that in-service training programs are useful in better preparing social services workers for these areas. Many workers, however, may not participate in such training. This study examined how the presence of domestic violence training policies influences participation in training programs and awareness of domestic violence. Implications for practice are provided.

Stories from Outside the Frame: Intimate Partner Abuse in Sexual-minority Women's Relationships with Transsexual Men

Author: Brown, Nicola11 65 Wellesley St. East, 3rd Floor, Toronto, ON M4Y 1G7, Canada nbrown@ctys.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61645721?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative research study examined the relational experiences of sexual-minority women partners of female-to-male transsexuals (N = 20) using grounded theory analysis. This article reports data on abusive relationships reported by a subset of the sample (N = 5), representing a unique and under-studied population. It explores the theoretical constructions that are available from the mainstream anti-violence movement and those from the anti-violence writings of other marginalized communities. Sexual-minority women described abuse tactics by their trans men partners that were influenced by the particularities of their trans partner's identity and oppression, as well as the features of the activist communities of which they were a part. The research findings of this aspect of the study suggest that the context of a 'first relationship' with a trans man, the social context of transphobia, and the traditional gender-based heterosexual model of relationship violence in which participants do not recognize themselves as victims of abuse all contribute to vulnerability to abuse. Clinical applications and community implications are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright 2007.]

Domestic Violence and Children's Presence: A Population-based Study of Law Enforcement Surveillance of Domestic Violence

Author: Fantuzzo, John W1; Fusco, Rachel A; Mohr, Wanda K; Perry, Marlo A1 Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania, 3700 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61395804?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of the present study was twofold: (1) to test whether law enforcement officers could reliably use a standard protocol to collect data on domestic violence events (DVEs) across a large municipality, and (2) to use these data to examine prevalence and nature of the violence and children's presence. Reliability checks indicated that data were collected reliably on over 5,000 substantiated DVEs. Findings showed that 48% of all assaults in the municipality were DVEs. Victims were predominantly females in their early thirties, and injuries were predominantly minor and resulted from body contact. Children were present in nearly 50% of the DVEs. They were disproportionately present in domestic violence households compared to all other households in the municipality. Domestic violence households with children were more likely to have mothers and fathers involved in the violence and were disproportionately minority households headed by single females in relatively poor neighborhoods.

An Examination of the Outcomes of Various Components of a Coordinated Community Response to Domestic Violence by Male Offenders

Author: Bouffard, Jeffrey A1; Muftic, Lisa R1 Criminal Justice Program, Washington State University, 801 Johnson Tower, Pullman, WA 99164, USA jbouffard@wsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61395614?accountid=14925

Abstract: With recognition that police intervention by itself is not entirely effective, in recent years there has been a shift in public policies towards the implementation of a coordinated community response to domestic violence incidents. This article examines the impact of participation in several aspects of a coordinated community response (CCR) in a mid-sized city in the Midwest. Specifically, recidivism was examined using information on officially recorded re-arrests for 131 male domestic violence offenders involved in a CCR type intervention. In addition, exploratory analyses attempt to determine if certain offender characteristics are related to their likely of progressing through each of several post-conviction components of this CCR-type intervention. Limitations of the research and suggestions for policy responses to domestic violence are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Dating Violence Victimization, Relationship Satisfaction, Mental Health Problems, and Acceptability of Violence: A Comparison of Men and Women

Author: Kaura, Shelby A1; Lohman, Brenda J1 Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61640616?accountid=14925

Abstract: Two of the most common reported consequences of dating violence are its impact on the victim's satisfaction with their romantic relationship and its impact on the victim's mental health. Recent research suggests that the strength of these relationships may be moderated by the degree to which the dating violence is acceptable to the victim. However, studies of these relationships have been limited to samples of women. The purpose of the present research was to examine the relationships among dating violence victimization, relationship satisfaction, mental health problems, and acceptability of violence for a sample that includes not only female victims, but also male victims. Using a sample of 155 male and 417 female college students, hierarchical regression analyses found that dating violence victimization is associated with relationship satisfaction and mental health problems for both men and women. For men, acceptability of violence moderated the relationship between dating violence victimization and the mental health problems of depression, anxiety, and somatization. For women, acceptability of violence moderated the relationship between dating violence victimization and relationship satisfaction only. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Victims' Accuracy in Assessing their Risk of Re-abuse

Author: Cattaneo, Lauren Bennett1; Bell, Margret E; Goodman, Lisa A; Dutton, Mary Ann1 Department of Psychology, George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, MSN 3F5, Fairfax, VA 22030, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61644251?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using four categories of accuracy (true positive, false positive, true negative, false negative), this study explored (1) how accurately intimate partner violence (IPV) victims are able to assess their risk of re-abuse; and (2) potential predictors of accuracy. Women seeking help for IPV (N=246) rated the likelihood that they would experience physical re-abuse in the coming year and then reported 18 months later whether those risks had been realized. Victim assessments were more likely to be right than wrong, and were subject to neither a pessimistic nor optimistic bias. In the multivariate analysis, significant/marginally significant predictors of the accuracy categories were the history of violence from this and former partners, level of substance use, PTSD symptoms, and the recency of the violence. Among the more robust findings were the connection between level of stalking and true positives, and between substance use and false negatives. This study suggests that victim assessments have significant potential to inform practice, and deserve further exploration. Adapted from the source document.

A Domestic Violence Course For Medical Students: A Study on Its Effectiveness

Author: Ergonen, Akca Toprak1; Salacin, Serpil; Karademir, Sevgi; Gursel, Yucel; Musal, Berna1 Department of Forensic Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, 35340-Inciralti, Izmir, Turkey toprak.ergonen@deu.edu.tr

Abstract: International health institutions emphasize the necessity of including the topic of domestic violence which is accepted as a health problem worldwide, into the training of physicians. The fact that physicians should diagnose domestic violence victims who over the years were either neglected or overlooked is also mentioned. The present study aims to measure the effectiveness of the interactive domestic violence course given to Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine (DEUFM) Year V students, with tests implemented before and after the course. The same students were given the same test during Year VI (internship). The students' average knowledge scores were found respectively as follows: pretest 78.66-10.54, second test 94.13-3.95 and third test 89.65-7.48. There was a statistically significant difference between tests' average scores. It was observed that, after the course, 4 out of 19 students (21.1%) changed their answers from 'no' to 'yes' for the question 'Have you ever been a victim of physical domestic violence?' A statistically significant difference was found between pre-course answers and the after course answers given to this question. This study showed that the course on domestic violence increased students' knowledge level and awareness on this issue. Considering that average knowledge level will decrease over time and aiming to improve future physicians' approach to domestic violence cases, addition of other interactive educational methods to Year V's course program and proposal of an advanced training session to Year VI's curriculum are being planned.

Clinically Significant Trauma Symptoms and Behavioral Problems in a Community-based Sample of Children Exposed to Domestic Violence

Author: Spilsbury, James C1; Belliston, Lara; Drotar, Dennis; Drinkard, Allyson; Kretschmar, Jeff; Creeden, Rosemary; Flannery, Daniel J; Friedman, Steve1 Mental Health Services, Inc., 1744 Payne Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44114, USA spilsburyj@mhs-inc.org

Abstract: This study assessed the associations of characteristics of domestic violence incidents with clinically significant levels of traumatic symptoms and behavioral problems in a socio-economically and ethnically mixed sample of 687 children participating in a community-service program for children witnessing violence. Study predictors included child/family demographic characteristics, type and chronicity of exposure, and child's perceptions of control over the event and threat to personal safety. Outcomes consisted of traumatic symptoms and behavior problems. Results showed that perceived threat and control were associated with greater odds of clinically significant levels of several trauma symptoms (and behavior problems in the case of perceived threat) after adjusting for effects of demographic factors and violence characteristics. Child co-victimization increased odds of reaching clinically significant levels of traumatic symptoms compared to children who witnessed the event but were not victimized. Female sex and White ethnicity increased odds of specific trauma symptoms and behavior problems. Increasing age reduced odds of some trauma symptoms. Associations between predictors and one outcome measure did not generalize across the other outcome measure. Implications of study findings, and directions for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Attending to the Role of Race/Ethnicity in Family Violence Research

Author: Malley-Morrison, Kathleen1; Hines, Denise A1 Boston University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61422747?accountid=14925

Abstract: Since the 1970s, researchers and public health and/or social policy communities have devoted increasing attention to family violence. Although officially reported crime figures for family violence appear to be declining, rates continue to be high in broadly defined racial and/or ethnic minority groups. More careful assessments of the potential role of race/ethnicity in family violence, and similarities and differences occurring across and within groups categorized based on race/ethnicity, are essential if adequate interventions are to be developed and utilized. This article provides suggestions on conducting better studies on family violence in the United States, particularly with respect to issues of race/ethnicity. The authors begin by considering conceptions and definitions of race/ethnicity and providing a broad definition of family violence. They then suggest issues for consideration at each stage of the research process, from reviewing previous research, to making methodological decisions, selecting samples, choosing measures, and analyzing and interpreting findings.

Dating Violence & Sexual Harassment Across the Bully-Victim Continuum Among Middle and High School Students

Author: Espelage, Dorothy L1; Holt, Melissa K1 220A Education, Champaign, IL 61820, USA email: espelage@uiuc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61641112?accountid=14925

Abstract: Associations among bullying, peer victimization, sexual harassment, and dating violence were examined among 684 middle and high school students. Cluster analysis of self-report measures revealed four distinct bully-victim subtypes: uninvolved, victims, bully-victims, and bullies. African-American students comprised the bully cluster more than White students, but did not report higher rates of dating violence or peer sexual harassment. Bully-victims reported significantly more physical dating violence victimization than members of all other groups, and more emotional abuse in dating relationships than uninvolved students and victims. Bully-victims and victims also reported the highest amount of peer sexual harassment. Anxiety/depression levels were highest among victims and bully-victims. Sexual harassment and dating violence experiences moderated the association between bully-victim subtype and anxiety/depression. That is, victims with the highest levels of sexual harassment and victims and bully-victims with the highest levels of dating violence reported the highest levels of anxiety/depression. Findings highlight the high-risk nature of the bully-victim group and the importance of assessing multiple forms of victimization affecting youth. Adapted from the source document.

Alcohol and Drug Consumption, Depressive Features, and Family Violence as Associated with Complaints to the Prosecutor's Office in Central Mexico

Author: Rey, Guillermina Natera1; Garcia, Francisco Juarez; Icaza, Maria Elena Medina-Mora; Sainz, Marcela Tiburcio1 Department of Psychosocial Research, Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria Ramon de la Fuente Muniz, Mexico City, Mexico

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61411945?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article is aimed at reporting the characteristics of the population detected at State Prosecutors' Offices including the two such offices that existed in the city selected for the study, one located in a general hospital for the inspection of violence-related cases (n = 156); and the second in the facility where all detainees are taken when arrested (n = 129), and where victims can file a complaint (n = 186). A household survey undertaken among the population 18 to 65 years of age (n = 887) was used as a group of reference. Both studies were undertaken in Pachuca City, the capital of Hidalgo, located 100 km from Mexico City during the second half of 1996. Face-to-face questionnaires were used to obtain sociodemographic data, drug use and drinking patterns, depressive symptomatology, and family violence. Discriminant and logistic regression analysis were undertaken. The age group from 18 to 24 displayed the highest number of legal complaints and arrests (OR = 1.773). The likelihood for appearing at a State Prosecutor's Office was higher for those living in an atmosphere of threats and injuries within the family (OR = 19) and for those that reported alcohol consumption on the day of the event (OR = 14). Extremely high rates of family violence were obtained in this sample, increasing the likelihood of arriving at the Prosecutor's Office either because arrested or for being a victim. Results confirm the relationship between alcohol use, depression, and violence, reinforcing the need to prevent alcohol abuse, especially among youth. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61392739?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research note describes the use of a broad range of technologies in intimate partner stalking, including cordless and cellular telephones, fax machines, e-mail, Internet-based harassment, global positioning systems, spy ware, video cameras, and online databases. The concept of 'stalking with technology' is reviewed, and the need for an expanded definition of cyberstalking is presented. Legal issues and advocacy-centered responses, including training, legal remedies, public policy issues, and technology industry practices, are discussed.

Understanding the Complexities of Feminist Perspectives on Woman Abuse: A Commentary on Donald G. Dutton's Rethinking Domestic Violence

Author: DeKeseredy, Walter S1; Dragiewicz, Molly1 U Ontario Instit Technology

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61663408?accountid=14925

Abstract: All books, including Donald G. Dutton's (2006) Rethinking Domestic Violence, are written & published in a specific political & economic context. As vividly described by Faludi (1991), Hammer (2002), & many others who made progressive contributions to an interdisciplinary understanding of the enduring discrimination against contemporary North American women, we still live in a climate characterized by vitriolic attacks on feminist scholarship, practice, & activism intended to secure women's basic human rights (DeKeseredy & Schwartz, 2003; Stanko, 2006). Despite its title, Dutton's new book does not focus on rethinking domestic violence. Instead, it is another example of the conservative backlash against feminism in general & feminist research on woman abuse in particular, a response that "helps to veil the extent & brutality of this problem & to block efforts to deal with it" (Hammer, 2002, p. 5). Dutton's preoccupation with feminism is reflected in entire chapters dedicated to criticizing feminist theory & research & the book's "bottom line" summary, where half of the main points concern Dutton's interpretation of feminism rather than new insights about domestic violence research. Accordingly, the main objective of this commentary is to respond to some of Dutton's criticisms of feminist inquiry & practice. References.

ARTICLES: Domestic Violence in Refugee Families in Australia: Rethinking Settlement Policy and Practice

Author: Rees, Susan1; Pease, Bob1 MSocPol (Hons.), Principal Research Fellow, School of Public Health, Tropical Medicine and Rehabilitation Sciences, James Cook University, Cairns, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61425352?accountid=14925

Abstract: It has been identified that immigrant and refugee women are particularly at risk in cases of domestic violence. This article reveals the qualitative research findings from a study into the significance of traumatic history, social and economic context, cultural differences and changed gender identities on the perceptions and experiences of domestic violence in refugee families. The study was undertaken with a sample of refugee men and women from Iraq, Ethiopia, Sudan, Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia. Compounding contextual factors concerning structurally based inequalities, culturally emerged challenges, social dissonance, psychological stress and patriarchal foundations are revealed. Informed by an intersectional framework that recognizes gender oppression as modified by intersections with other forms of inequality, the article argues the case for community-managed projects involving multi-level empowerment-based interventions to prevent domestic violence.

Transcending Boundaries: An International, Interdisciplinary Community Partnership to Address Domestic Violence

Abstract: This paper presents a participatory research and planned change effort to develop a coordinated community response system to domestic violence in a United States culturally diverse community with a large immigrant population. This work grew out of an international, interdisciplinary project that was designed to establish ongoing collaborative relationships between university and community practitioners in the United States, Honduras, and Costa Rica around the theme of intra-familial violence, particularly gender-based violence against women. The paper analytically describes the international collaborative project, the local community-based participatory research and community development project, and lessons learned from both the local and international interdisciplinary collaboration. Examination of differences across disciplinary and cultural contexts generated critical reflection on the need to consider reframing domestic violence in the context of fundamental human rights, as is the case in Central America. At the same time, challenges around developing a coordinated community response, addressing inadequacies in the legal system, and implementing education and training were echoed across boundaries, demonstrating the need for continued international collaboration.

Victims' perceptions of police response to domestic violence incidents

Author: Johnson, Ida M11 Department of Women's Studies and Department of Criminal Justice, Box 870320, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487-0320, United States ijohnson@ws.as.ua.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61671808?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the nature of police response to domestic violence incidents with a focus on the identification of areas of police intervention that female victims of domestic abuse find 'most' helpful and 'least' helpful. The first part of the study was based on the analysis of a random sample of incident reports of domestic abuse cases recorded in 2000 and 2001. These reports were examined to obtain information about the characteristics of domestic abuse victims and summary information about the incidents of domestic abuse offenses. The second stage of the research study involved a telephone survey conducted with a random sample of fifty female domestic abuse victims who called the police. The study examined female victims' perceptions of how the police responded to the domestic abuse incidents, how helpful or not so helpful victims found the police to be when they responded to their calls, and how their cases were handled by the legal system.

Intimate Partner Violence, Relationship Status, and Protective Orders Protective Orders: Does "Living in Sin" Entail a Different Experience?

Author: Shannon, Lisa1; Logan, T K; Cole, Jennifer1 University of Kentucky lisa.shannon@uky.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389261?accountid=14925

Abstract: The legal status of women's intimate relationships may allow for different experiences with intimate partner violence (IPV) and the protections received from the criminal justice system. There has been limited research examining differences in IPV and protective orders for women in marital and cohabiting intimate relationships. This study examines differences in experiences with IPV and factors related to protective orders: stipulations, violations, and perceived efficacy in a sample of married (n = 392) and cohabiting (n = 307) women with protective orders. Results suggest (a) married and cohabiting women are significantly different on a number of demographic characteristics; however, after controlling for these demographic differences, (b) married and cohabiting women's experiences with IPV are similar in almost all dimensions, except with the psychological tactic of degradation; and (c) married and cohabiting women receive similar protective order stipulations, experience similar rates of violations, and have the same overall perceptions of safety, freedom, and effectiveness pertaining to the domestic violence order. Implications for policy are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2007.]

Ethnicizing the Subject: Domestic Violence and the Politics of Primoridalism in Kazakhstan

Author: Snajdr, Edward

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61720140?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines how people understand domestic violence through primordialist notions of ethnicity in post-Soviet Kazakhstan. Drawing on fieldwork among police, victim advocates, and Muslim activists, I examine how these groups ethnically frame, or 'ethnicize', the topic of domestic violence, its victims and perpetrators, as well as its root causes and possible remedies. From explaining away ineffective policing to blaming past imperialism, I show how ethnicizing violence has political significance for these different stakeholders, whose assertions about gender behaviour and the function of the law compete with one another in a multi-ethnic state's transition from communism. I also discuss not only how these disparate identity positionings serve as local explanations and/or solutions, but also how they may inevitably contribute to concealing the problem.

Does the Criminal Justice System Treat Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Offenders Leniently?

Author: Felson, Richard B; Pare, Paul-Philippe

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61688456?accountid=14925

Abstract: We examine whether men who physically assault their female partners or who commit sexual assault receive more lenient treatment than offenders who commit other types of assaults. Analyses of the National Violence Against Women Survey do not support these hypotheses. Rather, they suggest that women who assault their male partners are particularly likely to avoid arrest. In addition, both men and women who assault partners are more likely to avoid conviction than other offenders. Evidence suggests that there has been an increase over time in rates of arrest and conviction for partner violence. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence: The Role of Suspect Gender in Prosecutorial Decision-Making

Author: Kingsnorth, Rodney F; MacIntosh, Randall C

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61643701?accountid=14925

Abstract: Utilizing a sample of 8,461 cases involving heterosexual intimate partner violence, this paper examines the role of suspect gender in prosecutorial decision-making. Four decision points are assessed: the decision to file charges (versus rejection for insufficient evidence); to file as a felony (versus a misdemeanor or probation violation); to dismiss for insufficient evidence (versus full prosecution); and to reduce felony charges to a misdemeanor or violation of probation. Suspect gender was found to be statistically significant in relation to all four outcomes in favoring female over male suspects. Numerous interaction effects were observed between gender and measures of prior arrest and offense severity in particular, suggesting that prosecutors distinguish between male and female suspects across these variables. We suggest that these data provide some support for recent qualitative research suggesting that court personnel are responsive to the gendered asymmetry of intimate partner violence, and may view female intimate violence perpetrators more as victims than offenders. Adapted from the source document.

An Exploratory Analysis of Victim Precipitation Among Men and Women Arrested for Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Muftic, Lisa R1; Bouffard, Leana Allen; Bouffard, Jeffrey A1 University of North Texas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810422680?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a complex social problem that has produced a wide variety of explanations. However, few studies have explored what, if any, role victim precipitation plays in IPV. Victim precipitation is generally defined as behavior by the victim that initiates the subsequent behavior of the victimizer; however, studies using this concept have often been accused of subtle and overt victim blaming. Distinguishing victim precipitation from victim blaming, this study explores the utility of victim precipitation in understanding contextual differences in men's and women's use of violence in intimate relationships and police use of dual arrest in IPV incidents. Results suggest that victim precipitation plays an important role in understanding incidents of IPV, especially in cases involving dual arrest.

Abstract: This study examines the responses of informal helpers to adolescents who disclose dating violence or upsetting but non-violent experiences in their romantic relationships. Based on a survey of 224 Midwestern high school students, the study found that youths were more likely to disclose problems to friends rather than others. A factor analysis of potential helpers' responses showed that, compared to avoidance and minimization, nurturing was the most typical response received. Adolescents who told someone about being victimized by severe dating violence were more likely to receive an avoidance response than those who told about less severe dating violence. Males encountered high levels of minimization regarding less severe dating violence. While friends and family seem to respond effectively to romantic relationship problems, youths need more training in how to respond helpfully to friends' difficulties with dating violence or how to encourage victims to seek help from trained practitioners.

A Family Affair: The Juvenile Court and Family Violence Cases

Author: Gebo, Erika11 Department of Sociology, Suffolk University, 8 Ashburton Place, Boston, MA 02108, USA egebo@suffolk.edu

Abstract: Little attention has been devoted to studies of adolescent family violence offending, yet research on adult populations show that victim relationship may make a difference in how offenders are treated in the criminal justice system. Given that the intergenerational transmission of violence may operate through adolescent family violence, a detailed examination of these youth is warranted. Through an analysis of detained youth in a small northeastern state, this study examines differences in court treatment between family and non-family offenders. Family violence offenders are significantly more likely to be minor offenders and to be female than are non-family offenders. Results of logistic regression show that, all else being equal, family violence youth are treated more leniently by the court than non-family offenders. Finally, while most youth are released to community dispositions, there are no differences in court-ordered family counseling between family and non-family offenders. These findings point to areas of needed research on adolescent family violence offenders and larger policy questions about how such youth should be treated relative to other youth. Adapted from the source document.

Characteristics of Domestic Violence Offenders: Associations with Childhood Exposure to Violence

Author: Murrell, Amy R1; Christoff, Karen A; Henning, Kris R1 University of North Texas, P.O. Box 311280, Denton, TX 76203-1280, USA amurrell@unt.edu

Abstract: Many women are abused by intimate partners, millions of children witness such acts, and many of these children are physically abused. Children who are exposed to violence often evidence difficulties, including violent behavior, as adults. One hypothesized mode of intergenerational transmission is modeling. There is evidence that witnessing and/or experiencing violence are related to different patterns of abusive behavior and, perhaps, psychopathology, but the extent of the relationship is unclear. This study examined differences in generality, frequency, and severity of violent offenses, nonviolent criminal behavior, and psychopathology within a battering population of 1,099 adult males with varying levels of exposure to violence as children. Generality, frequency, and severity of violence and psychopathology all increased as level of childhood exposure to violence increased. Modeling theory was supported by the findings that men who witnessed domestic violence as children committed the most frequent domestic violence, and men who were abused as children were more likely to abuse children. Men who were abused also committed more general violence. Adapted from the source document.

Children's Direct Exposure to Types of Domestic Violence Crime: A Population-based Investigation

Author: Fantuzzo, John W1; Fusco, Rachel A1 Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania, 3700 Walnut St., Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61399135?accountid=14925

Abstract: Police officers served as public health sentinels to collect data on children exposed to domestic violence across an entire municipality for 1 year. This study extended research by investigating a typology of domestic violence crimes and children's direct sensory exposure to these types. Police officers used a standard, validated protocol to collect data on all substantiated domestic violence. Findings revealed that almost half of all events had children present, and 81% of these children were directly exposed to the violence. Children under the age of 6 years old were at greater risk of exposure. Identified domestic violence households with children were more likely to be low-income, non-White, and headed by a single female, compared to households at large. Cluster analysis revealed seven domestic violence event profiles. Typology showed that children were disproportionately exposed to the most unstable and dangerous profiles including weapon use, mutual assault, and substance abuse. Adapted from the source document.

Spouse Abuse and Child Abuse by Army Soldiers

Abstract: This study analyzed data collected by the U.S. Army's Family Advocacy Program, the group primarily responsible for family violence prevention, identification, evaluation, treatment, and follow-up on Army installations. Patterns of spouse abuse and child abuse perpetrated within a five year period (2000-2004) were examined in a sample of 10,864 Army Soldiers who were substantiated for family violence offenses. Three groups of family violence offenders were compared: (1) those who perpetrated spouse offenses only; (2) those who perpetrated child offenses only; and (3) those who perpetrated both spouse and child offenses. Results showed that the majority of substantiated family violence offenders were spouse offenders who had not committed child abuse (61%), followed by child offenders who had not committed spouse abuse (27%), and finally those who committed both spouse and child offenses (12%). The three groups of family violence offenders differed in terms of the types of abuse they perpetrated (neglect of children, emotional abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse), their experiences of being a spouse abuse victim, and sociodemographic characteristics. Twelve percent of all spouse abusers committed multiple spouse abuse incidents, and 10% of all child abusers committed multiple child abuse incidents. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Using data on a nationally representative cohort of pregnant women in US cities, this study examines the prevalence and correlates of interpersonal violence (IPV)-physical, emotional, and coercion-control-during pregnancy and 1 year after birth. Overall, 33% of mothers and 40% of fathers experience some form of IPV during or after pregnancy. Hispanic women and those no longer romantically involved with their children's fathers were most likely to experience IPV during pregnancy. Less educated women, women who reported that they or their spouses used substances (i.e., alcohol or illicit drugs), and women who reported that their pregnancy was unwanted were at high risk of IPV both during and after their pregnancy. Violence during pregnancy strongly predicted violence after pregnancy. Recent immigrants were among the least likely to leave a violent relationship 1-year post-partum. US-born women who were employed during their pregnancy were among the most likely to leave an abusive relationship 1-year post-partum. Adapted from the source document.

Examining the Behavior of a System: An Outcome Evaluation of a Coordinated Community Response to Domestic Violence

Author: Salazar, Laura F1; Emshoff, James G; Baker, Charlene K; Crowley, Terrence1 Rollins School of Public Health, Behavioral Sciences and Health Education, 1520 Clifton Rd., N. E., Suite 214, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA

Abstract: One goal of a coordinated community response (CCR) to domestic violence is to create an infrastructure that will facilitate systems-level, and ultimately societal-level change. This study evaluated whether a CCR implemented in two counties in Georgia would be effective at increasing criminal justice system sanctions for male domestic violence offenders (i.e., arrests, prosecutions, convictions, sentencing, and referrals to batterer intervention programs). Time series analyses revealed that, in both counties, there was a significant increase in arrests of male offenders; however, law enforcement agencies also arrested more women following the intervention. More men were sentenced to probation and to attend a batterer's intervention program post-intervention in one county; in the second county, there was no change in these outcomes. Results highlight the importance of examining how a CCR may affect the behavior of criminal justice systems, especially in terms of the unintended consequences for women. Adapted from the source document.

Methodological Review of Intimate Partner Violence Prevention Research

Author: Murray, Christine E1; Graybeal, Jennifer1 The University of North Carolina at Greensboro

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809572873?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors present a methodological review of empirical program evaluation research in the area of intimate partner violence prevention. The authors adapted and utilized criterion-based rating forms to standardize the evaluation of the methodological strengths and weaknesses of each study. The findings indicate that the limited amount of empirical research related to intimate partner violence prevention demonstrates some consistent methodological strengths and limitations. The authors conclude with a presentation of recommendations for further research in the area of intimate partner violence prevention.

Intimate Partner Violence, Depression, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder as Additional Predictors of Low Birth Weight Infants Among Low-Income Mothers

Author: Rosen, Daniel1; Seng, Julia S; Tolman, Richard M; Mallinger, Gayle1 University of Pittsburgh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61386750?accountid=14925

Abstract: Estimates of intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy vary by population being studied, measures, and other methodological limitations, hindering the ability to gauge the relationship between IPV and negative birth outcomes. The authors report aggregated data from a subsample (n = 148) of the first three waves of the Women's Employment Study. The authors compared groups of women who did and did not give birth to low birth weight infants on demographic, material deprivation, risk behavior, mental health, and IPV factors. The prevalence of domestic violence was more than twice as high for women with low birth weight infants as those women who had a normal weight infant. When considering additional risk factors, including food insufficiency, substance dependence, and depression and/or posttraumatic stress disorder, IPV remained a significant indicator, but it was most strongly associated with low birth weight among women also experiencing depression and/or posttraumatic stress disorder.

Expanding The Compass Of Domestic Violence In The Hanoverian Metropolis

Author: Smith, Greg T11 University of Manitoba

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61637244?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recent historical scholarship has exposed the role of violence within the multiple dynamics of family life, providing important insights into gender relations and the abuse of power within domestic, conjugal relationships. With good reason, the analysis has privileged the experiences of women as victims of such violence in the past. Without denying this important characteristic of domestic violence, it may be helpful to expand the range of actions and actors to be considered when exploring its history. By scrutinizing the leading role played by women who used violence in the home, and by interrogating untapped sources such as newspaper accounts, the records of magistrates' courts or administrative records from charitable institutions, for example, for evidence of how other subordinate persons such as servants, apprentices and, of course, children, were also subjected to harsh physical correction and, in some terrible cases, systematic abuse, a clearer understanding of the eighteenth century thresholds of tolerance for such violence emerges. By expanding the compass of domestic violence, the subjective and discretionary application of the law in specific cases becomes better contextualized as the wide continuum for the role of violence in everyday life in eighteenth-century England comes more fully into focus. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence Politics in Post-Soviet States

Author: Johnson, Janet Elise11 Department of Political Science, Brooklyn College, City University of New York, James Hall 3401, 2900 Bedford Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11210, USA. Tel.: (718) 951 5000x1753, Fax: (718) 951 4833 johnson@brooklyn.cuny.edu

Abstract: This article, drawing upon three approaches from comparative political science, compares domestic violence politics in Russia with Ukraine, Moldova, and Armenia. It suggests that foreign assistance, not without unintended consequences, holds the best promise for initiating reform. It also shows that there is nothing particular about Russian culture that limits reform, especially, as activists can manipulate gender neo-traditionalism. Finally, the study suggests that institutionalized political channels for considering women's issues can facilitate feminist policy-making when pushed by an autonomous women's movement. In conclusion, the article suggests that studying gender politics in non-Western contexts requires integrating comparative with international theories. Adapted from the source document.

'Health's a difficult beast': The interrelationships between domestic violence, women's health and the health sector An Australian case study

Author: Fisher, Colleen1; Hunt, Lynne; Adamsam, Rhonda; Thurston, Wilfreda E1 Edith Cowan University Joondalup, WA, Australia c.fisher@ecu.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61427100?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper reports on the Australian component of a five nation study undertaken in Australia, Canada, Thailand, Bangladesh and Afghanistan examining policy networks that address women's health and domestic violence. It examines the relationship between health and domestic violence in Western Australia and analyses the secondary role assumed by health. The study adopted a qualitative research paradigm and semi-structured interviews. Snowball sampling was used to identify relevant and significant stakeholders and resulted in a final sample of 30 individuals representing three key areas: the 'health policy community', the 'domestic violence prevention community' and 'other interested stakeholders', that is, those who have an interest in, but who are not involved in, domestic violence prevention work. Results suggest that the secondary positioning of health is associated with the historical 'championing' of the issue in the women's movement; limited linkages between the health policy community and the domestic violence prevention community and within the health policy community itself; the 'fit' between domestic violence and the Western Australian Health Department mandate; and the mis-match between domestic violence and the medical model. The conclusion indicates a need for collaboration based on effective links across the domestic violence community and the health policy community. [Copyright 2007 Elsevier Ltd.]

Therapeutic Factors in Guidance versus Counseling Sessions of Domestic Violence Groups

Author: Waldo, Michael1; Kerne, Philip A, IV; Kerne, Valerie Van Horn1 New Mexico State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61411566?accountid=14925

Abstract: Group leaders randomly employed a counseling leadership approach for one session in place of the guidance leadership approach typically used in six ongoing domestic violence offender groups. Group members completed the Critical Incident Questionnaire to assess therapeutic factors and the Group Experience Rating Form to assess if the leadership approaches were worthwhile. Results suggested more participants experienced hope and information during the guidance sessions, and universality, cohesion, and interpersonal learning during the counseling sessions. Existential factors were more prevalent during the guidance sessions. There was no significant difference in the extent to which members believed the two approaches were worthwhile. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence Across Race and Ethnicity: Implications for Social Work Policy

Author: Grossman, Susan F1; Lundy, Marta1 Loyola University School of Social Work

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61658061?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence occurs across all ethnic and racial groups, profoundly affecting women, who are most frequently the victims. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2050, 50% of the population will be minorities. To contribute to the growing literature on race and domestic violence, this article uses data derived from domestic violence programs in a large Midwestern state between 1990 and 1995 to focus on the experiences of victims who sought services and examine how they vary by race and ethnicity. The limitations as well as practice and policy implications of the findings are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2007.]

Partner Abuse and Women's Substance Problems. From Vulnerability to Strength

Author: Call, Christine R1; Nelsen, Judith C1 University of St. Francis, Joliet, Illinois, ccall@stfrancis.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811290687?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this exploratory study, a convenience sample of 125 mostly low-income women of color who were in treatment for problems associated with misusing substances responded to standardized measures and researcher-developed questions about their use of substances and experiences with partner abuse. Most of the women stated that their substance problems began after their first incident of partner abuse and that their misuse of substances occurred before and after specific incidents of partner abuse. The women also described various strengths they had used to cope. Screening for substance problems and partner abuse in all settings, as well as the use of women's strengths in treatment, is suggested.

Double Jeopardy: Risk Assessment in the Context of Child Maltreatment and Domestic Violence

Author: Shlonsky, Aron1; Friend, Colleen1 Bell Canada Child Welfare Research Center, University of Toronto, 246 Bloor Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5S1A1, Canada aron.shlonsky@utoronto.ca

Abstract: Investigations of child maltreatment often involve domestic violence, but there is little guidance about how to properly assess risk in such cases. Empirically validated risk assessment tools have been used successfully in child welfare and, to a lesser extent, in cases involving domestic violence, but these have generally not been utilized in tandem. Using the allegation of child maltreatment as the entry point for services, this paper proposes a nested risk assessment framework whereby risk of both child maltreatment and domestic violence are considered simultaneously using two different standardized instruments. Adapted from the source document.

In Whose Best Interest? A Canadian Case Study of the Impact of Child Welfare Policies in Cases of Domestic Violence

Author: Alaggia, Ramona1; Jenney, Angelique; Mazzuca, Josephine; Redmond, Melissa1 University of Toronto, 246 Bloor Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A1, Canada ramona.alaggia@utoronto.ca

Abstract: North American child protection systems have been experiencing an era of sweeping child welfare reform over the last decade. Despite the breadth of these changes, legislative and policy impacts are rarely evaluated to ascertain whether changes are resulting in the outcomes they were designed to achieve. Using a participatory research framework, 70 participants from relevant service sectors and service recipients from a large urban centre in Canada, were interviewed about legislation in cases of children exposed to domestic violence. While most stakeholders noted the "spirit of the Act" to be well-meaning and based on a credible body of child research, there were serious concerns cited with the implementation and impact of policies that resulted from this piece of child welfare legislation. Reluctance of abused women to disclose or seek services for their families, isolation between helping professionals from different sectors, increased demand for services, increased surveillance of mothers, and decreased accountability of perpetrators were predominant themes identified. These data strongly suggest that response models be tested as pilot studies, rigorously evaluated and fully implemented only when there are assurances that appropriate and adequate services are available to meet the complex needs of the communities they are designed to serve.

Intimate Partner Violence and Child Maltreatment: Overlapping Risk

Author: Zolotor, Adam J1; Theodore, Adrea D; Coyne-Beasley, Tamera; Runyan, Desmond K1 Department of Family Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB# 7595, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7595

Abstract: Studies of intimate partner violence (IPV) and child maltreatment (CM) have examined the association between IPV and physical abuse. Children in homes with IPV may also experience other forms of CM. The objective is to determine the prevalence of CM in homes with and without IPV using cross-sectional analysis of survey data of mothers with partners (n = 1,232). The Conflict Tactics Scale and Parent Child Conflict Tactics Scale were used to determine IPV, physical, psychological, sexual abuse, and neglect. Mothers reporting IPV (either man to woman or woman to man) report 2.57 times the odds of physical abuse compared to those not reporting IPV (95% CI 1.11-5.97). Moms reporting IPV report 2.04 times the odds of neglect. Those reporting IPV report 9.58 times the odds of psychological abuse (95% CI 4.27-21.49). Mothers reporting IPV report 4.90 times the odds of sexual abuse (95% CI 0.43-55.67). IPV is associated with all forms of CM in this sample. Providers of IPV services for women with children should also assess for all forms of child maltreatment. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Increased recognition of the unique needs of children exposed to domestic violence (CEDV) is evidenced by the evolving knowledge base on this issue. The breadth of quantitative research that exists has laid a foundation upon which to build effective time-limited intervention strategies. Still, intervention research in this area has yet to move toward advanced practice models. Definitional and methodological limitations have also impeded knowledge advancement. This paper uses a novel approach to critically review 5 quantitative meta- and mega-analyses on the effects of childhood exposure to domestic violence. Research and practice implications derived from these quantitative analyses that may assist child welfare professionals, domestic violence advocates, and researchers interested in providing effective intervention and services to CEDV are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

From Culture Clash to New Possibilities: A Harm Reduction Approach to Family Violence and Child Protection Services

Author: Shlonsky, Aron1; Friend, Colleen; Lambert, Liz1 Bell Canada Child Welfare Research Center, University of Toronto, Faculty of Social Work, 246 Bloor Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5S1A1, Canada aron.shlonsky@utoronto.ca

Abstract: This article examines the separate but sometimes overlapping foci of domestic violence (DV) and child protection services. When these sectors interact, the resulting tension becomes part of a complex dialectic and multiple opposing propositions that are explored here with respect for how they affect practice. A review of 30 years of DV discourse leads to systematic examinations of the DV literature for battered women, mental health, children, and offenders. The article proposes a radical shift by pairing a harm reduction approach with an evidence-based practice model when DV and child protection intersect. The implications of Stage of Change theory are considered in relationship to the harm reduction approach. Adapted from the source document.

The Relationship Between Domestic Violence and Child Neglect

Abstract: This study examined the comorbidity of child neglect and domestic violence (DV in a sample of public child welfare cases. All cases investigated for child neglect in 1999 (N = 2,350 families) from a single county in Kentucky were included in the analysis. Findings indicate that DV was comorbid in approximately 29% of the cases and, although cases were more likely to be opened when child neglect was substantiated, they were less likely to be opened when DV was also present. A secondary random subsample of 100 cases were reviewed to examine the impact of this comorbidity on the child welfare workers assessment of risk and problems in children's functioning, the relationship between DV and risk factors contained on the risk assessment, and the workers' response to DV through legal actions and incorporation of DV into the case plan. The results showed that child welfare workers rate families at significantly greater risk, particularly when there was previously unreported DV, and identified more problems in children's interpersonal functioning when DV was present. DV was significantly correlated with more severe neglect and a limited social support network for the family. Although workers took a number of legal actions in response to DV, DV was addressed in only 35% of child welfare case plans. Adapted from the source document.

Intervention on behalf of children exposed to intimate partner violence: Assessment of support in a diverse community-based sample

Author: Taylor, CA1; Sorenson, S B1 1440 Canal St., TW-19, Suite 2301, New Orleans, LA 70112, United States

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/808434844?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: The aim of this study is to assess community-based support for intervening on behalf of children exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) and to determine what contextual and respondent characteristics are associated with that support. Method: An experimental vignette design was used in a random-digit-dial survey of six ethnic groups in California. For each respondent (n=3679), seven vignettes about IPV were generated using randomized categories of victim and assailant characteristics (i.e., gender and sexual orientation, age, ethnicity, nativity, occupational status, and relationship status) and situational characteristics (i.e., motivation, weapon use, type of abuse, alcohol use, frequency of the incident, and child present). All vignettes analyzed for this manuscript (n=6556) mentioned that ''there was a child in the other room'' during the incident. Results: In 70% of the IPV scenarios, respondents supported intervention on behalf of the child. Support was lowest when the IPV was purely psychological in nature (62-63%), higher when it involved threats, coercion, or limited physical abuse (68-71%), and highest when it involved severe physical abuse (76-81%). The odds of supporting intervention also were elevated when a weapon was involved, when the IPV occurred multiple times, and when the IPV involved gay men. Men and Vietnamese Americans had the lowest odds of favoring intervention. Conclusions: Public opinion assessed in this survey is aligned with that of professionals who believe that the potential impact of IPV on children should not be ignored and who have suggested that criteria should be developed to guide a graded intervention response for such cases.

Abstract: The prevalence of domestic violence (DV) during pregnancy could be high and is associated with significant psychological and physical impairment for mother and the fetus. The major objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of DV in expectant mothers who have attended the Iran University of Medical Sciences' Hospitals (IUMS). In this cross-sectional study, 1,800 subjects were interviewed using a modified questionnaire to determine the prevalence of DV. Consecutive sampling was performed in six major hospitals of IUMS according to the number of referred patients. The prevalence of DV was found to be 60.6% including three types of physical, psychological, and sexual violence with the prevalence of 14.6, 60.5 and 23.5%, respectively. Severe physical DV was 5.3%. Severe psychological and sexual DV were also found in about 24.6 and 3.4% of cases, respectively. DV had a high prevalence in this study. It is recommended that all accessible pregnant women be screened for DV. Study of the prevalence of DV within the community with a larger sample size, and using cluster-sampling methodology would be of immense value. Adapted from the source document.

Mothering and Domestic Violence: A Longitudinal Analysis

Author: Letourneau, N L1; Fedick, C B; Willms, J D1 Faculty of Nursing and Canadian Research Institute for Social Policy, University of New Brunswick (UNB), P.O. Box 4400, Fredericton, NB, Canada, E3B 5A3

Abstract: The quality of the relationships that parents, particularly mothers, have with their children is a potent predictor of children's future development. Recent research suggests that mothers of preschool-age children exposed to domestic violence may be more sensitive and responsive to their children than other parents. This heightened sensitivity and responsiveness in relationships may be key to the successful development of some children exposed to domestic violence; however this theory remains unexplored. The Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth provided a large sample size suitable for longitudinal analysis of the relationship between exposure to family violence and parenting behaviors. Analysis revealed that mothers of children exposed to domestic violence may indeed compensate for exposure to violence in their parenting interactions with their 2- to 12-year-old children. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Psychological Health in a Sample of Asian and Caucasian Women: The Roles of Social Support and Coping

Author: Lee, Joohee1; Pomeroy, Elizabeth C; Bohman, Tom M1 School of Social Work, The University of Southern Mississippi, 118 College Drive #5114, Hattiesburg, 39406-0001, MS, USA joohee.lee@usm.edu

Abstract: This study examined the potential mediating effects of social support and coping strategies on the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and psychological outcomes. A sample of 100 Caucasian women and 61 Asian women were recruited from domestic violence agencies. Structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model. Analysis of the combined group revealed that there was an indirect effect of the level of violence on psychological outcomes via the mediating variables of perceived social support and passive coping strategies. Ethnic group comparisons, however, indicated differences between Caucasian and Asian women. In the Caucasian group, the level of violence had an indirect effect on psychological outcomes via the mediating variables of perceived social support and passive coping strategies. In contrast, in the Asian group, the direct effect of the level of violence on psychological outcomes was strong and significant, and the mediating roles of these variables were not found. Research implications for practice are delineated. Adapted from the source document.

External Barriers to Help Seeking for Older Women Who Experience Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Beaulaurier, Richard L1; Seff, Laura R; Newman, Frederick L; Dunlop, Burton1 School of Social Work, Florida International University, 11200 SW 8 St., HLS II 364B, Miami, FL 33175, USA

Abstract: There has been relatively little research published to guide the field in identifying and addressing barriers to seeking help for older women who experience domestic violence (DV). The current article focuses on findings related to external behaviors to help-seeking in the Domestic Violence Against Older Women (DVAOW) study. Data were collected in 21 focus groups with 134 women, 45 to 85 years of age. External barriers, described by DVAOW respondents as contributing to the reluctance of some older women to seek help for domestic abuse, include response of family, response of clergy, response of the justice system, and responsiveness of community resources. These findings are discussed with implications for community outreach and future research. Adapted from the source document.

Acculturation Stress, Drinking, and Intimate Partner Violence Among Hispanic Couples in the U.S.

Author: Caetano, Raul1; Ramisetty-Mikler, Suhasini; Vaeth, Patrice A Caetano; Harris, T Robert1 University of Texas School of Public Health

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61423409?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the cross-sectional association between acculturation, acculturation stress, drinking, and intimate partner violence (IPV) among Hispanic couples in the U.S. The data being analyzed come from a multicluster random household sample of couples interviewed as part of the second wave of a 5-year national longitudinal study. The overall survey response rate for the second wave is 72%. Participants are Hispanic couples 18 years of age or older (N = 387). Results show that, among men, lower acculturation is positively associated with higher acculturation stress, which is directly related to a greater likelihood of involvement in IPV. These associations are also present among women. However, data for women show an additional path linking higher levels of acculturation directly to IPV. Drinking is not associated with IPV, independent of gender. Acculturation, directly or through acculturation stress, increases the likelihood of IPV.

Closing in: Stalking in the Context of Intimate Partner Abuse

Author: Melton, Heather C

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61773383?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reviews the literature on stalking in the context of intimate partner abuse (IPA). It is now known that stalking is most common among people who know each other, with a high prevalence among current and former intimates. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between stalking and IPA, both physical violence and emotional abuse. This is referred to as stalking in the context of IPA. This type of stalking differs from other types in terms of its nature, prevalence, and effects. In addition, there are differences among intimate partner stalkers as well. Future research needs to focus on this type of stalking and explore theories behind why it is occurring and ways we should be responding to and treating it. Adapted from the source document.

Race/Ethnicity, Religious Involvement, and Domestic Violence

Author: Ellison, Christopher G1; Trinitapoli, Jenny A; Anderson, Kristin L; Johnson, Byron R1 University of Texas at Austin

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61418351?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors explored the relationship between religious involvement and intimate partner violence by analyzing data from the first wave of the National Survey of Families and Households. They found that: (a) religious involvement is correlated with reduced levels of domestic violence; (b) levels of domestic violence vary by race/ethnicity; (c) the effects of religious involvement on domestic violence vary by race/ethnicity; and (d) religious involvement, specifically church attendance, protects against domestic violence, and this protective effect is stronger for African American men and women and for Hispanic men, groups that, for a variety of reasons, experience elevated risk for this type of violence.

Intimate Partner Violence and Suicidality in Low-Income African American Women: A Multimethod Assessment of Coping Factors

Author: Reviere, Susan L1; Farber, Eugene W; Twomey, Heather; Okun, Alexandra; Jackson, Emily; Zanville, Holly; Kaslow, Nadine J1 Emory University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61413643?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study used quantitative and qualitative methods to examine psychological factors that influence links between intimate partner violence (IPV) and suicidality in a sample of low-income African American women. Quantitative results demonstrated greater general coping, more efficacious behavioral strategies in response to IPV, more effective use of resources, greater use of social support, and less substance use among women who did not attempt suicide compared with those who did. Qualitative findings showed that suicide attempters showed less adaptive coping strategies aimed at accommodating the abuser, whereas nonattempters were more focused on strategies that supported leaving the relationship and/or avoiding further harm.

The Perceptions of High-Risk Victims of Domestic Violence to a Coordinated Community Response in Cardiff, Wales

Author: Robinson, Amanda L1; Tregidga, Jasmin1 Cardiff University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61427473?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research was conducted with very high-risk victims of domestic violence to determine their levels of revictimization one year after being referred to a Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) and their perceptions of this type of intervention. The MARACs provide increased and ongoing communication between agencies and victims, risk assessments, advocacy to victims, help translating policy into action, and help in holding perpetrators to account. More than 4 in 10 victims reported no further violence one year after the MARAC. Nearly all victims first attributed responsibility for ending the violence to themselves and then acknowledged the importance of having multiagency support once they were ready to change their situations. This research reveals that taking a holistic multiagency approach to domestic violence can reduce recidivism, even among the population most at risk.

Predicting Women's Perceptions of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Agency Helpfulness: What Matters to Program Clients

Author: Zweig, Janine M1; Burt, Martha R1 The Urban Institute

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61647092?accountid=14925

Abstract: Study goals were to assess if community agency interactions, the characteristics of services provided by staff, and the combinations of services received can predict women's perceptions of victim service helpfulness around domestic violence and sexual assault. Data were collected from agency representatives in 26 communities, and both women who used services and others living in the community (n = 1,509 women). Women found nonprofit victim services more helpful based on staff behavior in those agencies and the extent to which women felt control when working with staff; helpfulness of services was enhanced when agencies interacted with the legal system and other community agencies.

Abusers' Perceptions of the Effect of Their Intimate Partner Violence on Children

Author: Rothman, Emily F1; Mandel, David G; Silverman, Jay G1 Boston University School of Public Health

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61647624?accountid=14925

Abstract: Little is known about how intimate partner violence (IPV) abusers perceive the effect of their violence on their children. Analyzing the attitudes and behavioral intentions of 464 partner-abusive fathers, biological fathers were found to be more likely than social fathers to express concern about the effects of their abuse on their children. However, biological fathers were no more likely than social fathers to report intentions to stop their violence or otherwise take action to mitigate the harm of IPV exposure to their children. The findings suggest that fathers' statements of concern may be poor indicators of their intentions to refrain from abusive behavior.

Intimate Partner Abuse of Older Men: Considerations for the Assessment of Risk

Author: Reeves, Kim A1; Desmarais, Sarah L; Nicholls, Tonia L; Douglas, Kevin S1 Graduate Student, Department of Psychology, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, V5A 1S6, Canada kreeves@sfu.ca

Abstract: Intimate partner abuse among older persons, though less common than among the general population, is a significant concern. Drawing from the intimate partner abuse and elder abuse literatures, this paper presents considerations for the assessment of risk for intimate partner abuse perpetrated against older men, with reference to the prevalent gendered view of abuse between intimate partners. Potential victim and perpetrator risk factors specific to this context are discussed and existing risk assessment tools are introduced. Implications and future research directions are discussed with regard to the application of risk assessment technology to this context. Adapted from the source document.

The construction of self in online support groups for victims of domestic violence

Author: Hurley, Anna L1; Sullivan, Paul; McCarthy, John1 Department of Applied Psychology, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61708492?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article, we use the exemplar of domestic violence to examine the construction of self online. To do this, a positional approach to language is combined with a Bakhtinian inspired, phenomenological approach to language. Such an approach is designed to capture both the rhetorical and the intoned quality of language. This approach also draws attention to the role of the assumed community in dialogically interrupting and reflexively structuring the construction of self online. From this conceptual perspective, we examine a variety of posted messages to the public bulletin boards of a number of different online support groups for domestic violence. Three interpenetrating analytic themes emerged from this analysis: (1) The construction of self in relation to online support group members; (2) The construction of self in relation to abuser and (3) The construction of self in relation to past self. These themes are explicated over four key extracts. These extracts are also analysed in terms of the insights they offer into the phenomenological, positional and dialogical dimensions of an utterance directed at a community.

Do good intentions beget good policy? A review of child protection policies to address intimate partner violence

Author: Nixon, Kendra L1; Tutty, Leslie M; Weaver-Dunlop, Gillian; Walsh, Christine A1 Faculty of Social Work, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada klnixon@ucalgary.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61407080?accountid=14925

Abstract: In response to the growing concern that children are adversely affected by being exposed to intimate partner violence, significant changes have been made to child protection policy in many parts of the Western world. This article reviews and analyzes these policies/legislative changes in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand to provide a general analysis of how the issue of child exposure to intimate partner violence has been addressed within a child protection policy context. Legislation or policy decisions that broadly define any children who are exposed to violence in the home as maltreated can be problematic as they may further victimize abused women and their children, and overwhelm already overburdened child protection systems. The paper proposes guidelines to more adequately protect the safety and well-being of children by offering support and protection to the adult victim while holding the perpetrator accountable.

Social Capital, Human Capital, and Reaching Out for Help with Domestic Violence: A Case Study of Women in a Vietnamese-American Community

Author: Bui, Hoan N; Morash, Merry

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61668418?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper uses the social capital framework, with a focus on women's location in multiple contexts, including family, community, and the metropolitan area, and on both positive and negative results of social capital, to enhance knowledge about abused women's patterns of seeking help. Data from in-depth interviews with 62 abused women living in one Vietnamese-American community indicate that social capital in the immigrant community can be a source of help, but can also limit women's connecting with a full range of potential help providers. Family and friends give much needed emotional and material help but often encourage women not to use the legal system. Religious settings can bring comfort but also reinforce beliefs that women should acquiescence to violence to maintain an intact, harmonious family. Although the immigrant community affords benefits from solidarity, it also discourages women from challenging traditional gender arrangements by asking for help with domestic violence. Strategies to increase access to help, and for community education, can enable women to reach out for a variety of types of assistance before and after violence becomes extreme.

Reactions to dating violence among Latino teenagers: An experiment utilizing the Articulated Thoughts in Simulated Situations paradigm

Author: Rayburn, Nadine Recker1; Jaycox, Lisa H; McCaffrey, Daniel F; Ulloa, Emilio C; Zander-Cotugno, Megan; Marshall, Grant N; Shelley, Gene A1 RAND Corporation, 1776 Main Street, Santa Monica, CA 90407, USA rayburn@rand.org

Abstract: Dating violence is a serious problem among adolescents and young adults. Understanding teens' reactions to dating violence offers the potential to understand the factors that lead to perpetration of violent behavior and to elucidate prevention strategies. Knowledge concerning youth attitudes about dating violence is limited, and has largely come from self-report questionnaires to date. We utilized the Articulated Thoughts in Simulated Situations (ATSS) paradigm to assessing Latino teens' reactions to dating violence. Forty-one 9th grade students were presented with four simulated dating violence scenarios, and articulated their thoughts in response to them. Teens' reactions to dating violence differed on a variety of dimensions as a function of their gender, the gender of the perpetrator, and familiarity with the perpetrator.

Policing domestic violence: Does officer gender matter?

Author: Sun, Ivan Y11 Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, United States Isun@udel.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61677488?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research assessed whether female officers respond to domestic violence differently from male officers. Though many studies had analyzed police responses to domestic violence since the 1980s, very few had empirically examined different types of actions, especially noncoercive actions, employed by women and men in handling domestic violence. Using data collected by a large-scale observational project, this research analyzed police supportive and control actions toward citizens involved in domestic violence. Findings showed that female officers were more likely than male officers to provide support to citizens involved in domestic violence. Female and male officers, however, did not differ significantly in exercising control actions toward citizens. Regression results from separate models for female and male officers revealed that some of the variables are predictive of police actions for one gender but not the other. Implications for policy and future research are discussed. [Copyright 2007 Elsevier Ltd.]

Who Is Most at Risk for Intimate Partner Violence?: A Canadian Population-Based Study

Author: Romans, Sarah1; Forte, Tonia; Cohen, Marsha M; Du Mont, Janice; Hyman, Ilene1 University of Toronto, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61693979?accountid=14925

Abstract: Whole population studies on intimate partner violence (IPV) have given contradictory information about prevalence and risk factors, especially concerning gender. The authors examined the 1999 Canadian General Social Survey data for gender patterns of physical, sexual, emotional, or financial IPV from a current or ex-partner. More women (8.6%) than men (7.0%, p = .001) reported partner physical abuse in general, physical IPV causing physical injury (p < .0001), sexual abuse (1.7% vs. 0.2%, p < .0001), and financial abuse (4.1% vs. 1.6%, p < .0001). There were no gender differences for partner emotional abuse. Significant risk factors after multivariate modeling for physical/sexual IPV were younger age, being divorced/separated or single, having children in the household, and poor self-rated physical health. These findings from a large, randomly generated data set further refine our understanding of the risk profile for IPV in the developed world.

Perceptions of Domestic Violence and Mock Jurors' Sentencing Decisions

Author: Kern, Rosalie1; Libkuman, Terry M; Temple, Stacey L1 Michigan Technological University rpkern@mtu.edu

Abstract: The purpose of the investigation was to examine the influence of the victim's provocation and hopefulness on the sentencing of a husband convicted of domestic violence. It was hypothesized that mock jurors would assign less-severe sentencing if the victim was provoking and hopeful. Mock jurors read one of four factorial court case combinations of provocation and hopefulness and rendered an individual predeliberation sentence and a group postdeliberation sentence. Analyses revealed a significant effect of provocation, indicating that participants reduced the sentencing for the defendant when the wife was provoking relative to when she was not provoking. The analyses also revealed an effect of gender on predeliberation sentencing, with women delivering more-severe sentences than men. The effect of gender was not present in the postdeliberation sentencing, indicating that deliberation produced a sentencing compromise between women and men. The implications of these findings are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2007.]

Through a Different Lens: The Social Sanctioning of Family Violence

Author: McCormick, Marie L11 Hartford Doctoral Fellow in Geriatric Social Work, New York, NY, 10128 mariemccormick@consultant.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61400730?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence in the family does not exist in a vacuum. It is situated in a context of language and values that express society's ambivalence toward this phenomenon. This article begins with a discussion of the theoretical dimensions of this ambivalence focusing on violence as a means of social control and on behavioral-genetic theory as a lens through which to view this issue. It suggests that Traditional American Values underlie the social sanctioning of family violence and offers judicial and social policy decisions that support and result from this ideology. It concludes with implications for social work policy practice. Adapted from the source document.

Experiences and Perceptions of Intimate Partner Violence Among Older Chinese Immigrants

Author: Shibusawa, Tazuko1; Yick, Alice1 LCSW, Associate Professor, School of Social Work, New York University, New York, NY, 10003 tazuko.shibusawa@nyu.edu

Abstract: This study examines the experiences and perceptions of domestic violence among older Chinese immigrants, using data from a larger sample of Chinese Americans who reside in a major metropolitan area in the West Coast (Yick, 2000). A subset of respondents 50 years and older who are foreign-born (n = 77) were selected to (1) examine older Chinese immigrants' experiences with physical abuse by a spouse, (2) explore the definitions and perceptions of intimate partner violence among older Chinese, and (3) examine the relationship between acculturation, victimization experiences, and perceptions of domestic violence among this population. Findings indicate that close to 7% of the women and 6% of the men have experienced minor physical violence by their spouses during the past 12 months. Gender and acculturation were associated with perceptions and attitudes towards domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

Evaluation of a Wraparound Process for Children Exposed to Family Violence

Author: Crusto, Cindy A1; Lowell, Darcy I; Paulicin, Belinda; Reynolds, Jesse; Feinn, Richard; Friedman, Stacey R; Kaufman, Joy S1 Division of Prevention and Community Research, Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine

Abstract: Numerous programs have been established to help children who have experienced or are experiencing family violence, but few of these programs have been systematically evaluated. To contribute to the field's understanding of interventions for young children exposed to family violence and their families, we evaluated an intervention that offers comprehensive assessment, targeted caregiver-child intervention, individualized service planning, and care coordination. Baseline-to-discharge results revealed (1) a significant decrease over time in the number of potentially traumatic events that children experienced, including family and nonfamily violence events, (2) significant decreases over time in children's post-traumatic stress-intrusive thoughts and post-traumatic stress-avoidance behaviors, (3) significant decreases in self-reported stress associated with the parenting role among caregivers, (4) favorable ratings of services by care-givers, and (5) high levels of service receipt.

Direct Service Recommendations for Children and Caregivers Exposed to Community and Domestic Violence

Author: Schewe, Paul A11 Interdisciplinary Center for Research on Violence, University of Chicago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61426735?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes an evaluation of several programs designed to help children and caregivers who have been exposed to domestic or community violence. The goal of the evaluation was to improve our understanding of community-based services and outcomes for children who have been exposed to violence. Evaluators and service providers from nine sites in Illinois developed a survey for providers to describe (1) services provided to children and their caregivers and (2) the outcomes of those services. Results suggest that direct services benefit both caregivers and children. Regression analyses demonstrated that caregiver services focusing on the impact of violence on children, sexual abuse, building support systems, and grief and loss provided the best outcomes for caregivers, while caregiver services that focused on appropriate discipline were associated with positive outcomes for children. Children improved most when they received services focusing on identifying and expressing feelings, differentiating between good and bad touches, domestic violence, and community violence.

An Evaluation of Police Compliance with Domestic Violence Documentation Policy Reform: Improving the Identification of Exposed Children

Author: Shields, John P11 Education, Training, & Research Associates, San Francisco

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61401827?accountid=14925

Abstract: Policies and procedures governing police responses to domestic violence incidents were recently modified due to the growing awareness of the impact of domestic violence on children and the realization that law enforcement systems have traditionally struggled to respond appropriately to families experiencing domestic violence. In this study, over 3,000 felony domestic violence investigation files collected by the San Francisco Police Department between June 2003 and December 2004 were reviewed in order to assess the quality of police documentation regarding domestic violence incidents, family characteristics, and whether or not children witnessed the domestic violence. Results of the review suggest that police documentation has improved significantly over the past few years, but problems in data quality remain. Police files were significantly more likely to contain required supplemental incident reporting forms when police officers documented the presence of a child at the scene. The study concludes that police could play a more significant role not only in the prevention of children's exposure to domestic violence but also in the prevention of exposure-associated effects if they were more systematic in their compliance with policy-mandated documentation procedures. Adapted from the source document.

Crisis Intervention for Children and Caregivers Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Blodgett, Christopher1; Behan, Kathleen; Erp, Michael; Harrington, Roy; Souers, Kristin1 Area Health Education Center of Eastern Washington, Washington State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61415777?accountid=14925

Abstract: Few individuals exposed to violence ever receive formal services. Crisis intervention may increase the identification of exposed families and reduce violence and its consequences. The Spokane Safe Start crisis response served 464 families and 972 children who have been exposed to trauma, primarily intimate partner violence. Clinical records evaluated for service scope and benefit by independent reviewers showed improved family and child functioning and violence termination for 13 percent of children. Logistic regression analyses showed that adult victim and assailant characteristics can predict service progress and benefit. Families were receptive to support, and many engaged in more extended services with resulting benefits. Crisis intervention for violence exposure is a promising method of engaging families who may not otherwise be identified as in need of formal services. Adapted from the source document.

Systematic review of the perceptions and experiences of accessing health services by adult victims of domestic violence

Author: Robinson, Louise1; Spilsbury, Karen1 Hull PCT, Marfleet Primary Care Centre, Hull, and louise.robinson@hullpct.nhs.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61356368?accountid=14925

Abstract: This systematic review synthesises evidence on the perceptions and experiences of adult victims of domestic violence when accessing healthcare services. The review was concerned with disclosure of domestic violence by adult victims when accessing health services, the responses of healthcare professionals to these victims, victims' perceived barriers to support, and the appropriateness of support and referrals. These aims required the review to focus on studies using in-depth qualitative methods to explore victims' perceptions and experiences. A comprehensive systematic search of 12 databases was carried out in June/July 2005. Application of the review protocol and inclusion criteria resulted in 10 studies (conducted in the UK, USA and Australia) being considered eligible for the review. Data were extracted from these studies and a quality assessment completed. Thematic analysis was carried out to enable the identification of recurrent themes within the included studies. Findings indicate that victims of domestic violence experience difficulties when accessing healthcare services. Victims perceive that these difficulties can be attributed to inappropriate responses by healthcare professionals, discomfort with the healthcare environment, perceived barriers to disclosing domestic violence, and a lack of confidence in the outcomes of disclosure to a health professional. The methodological quality of included studies was variable, but no papers were rejected based on quality issues. These results can contribute to and inform a comprehensive assessment of the experiences of adult victims of domestic violence when accessing healthcare services. The health service is in a unique position to contribute towards the assessment and identification of domestic violence and to provide access to appropriate support. The messages of this study are important for policy-makers and practitioners. Accepted for publication 15 May 2007. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The objectives of this research were to assess the reciprocal behavior of couples in violent dating relationships, and to examine the sociodemographic variables that relate to dating violence among Israeli adolescents, using five types of dating violence measures: threatening, physical, relational, sexual and verbal violence [Wolfe, D. A., Scott, K., Retzel-Jaffe, D., Wekerle, C., Grasley, C., & Straatman, A. L. (2001). Development and validation of the conflict in adolescent dating relationship inventory. Psychological Assessment 13(2) 277-293]. The sample consisted of 1357 participants randomly selected from among 9-12th grade pupils enrolled in eight Arab and eight Jewish junior and senior high schools. Schools were randomly selected from a list of schools in central and northern Israel. Only 778 (57%) of participants had started dating. The principal finding of the study is that dating violence is very high among Israeli youths, especially Arabs, and that violent dating behavior is probably reciprocal among couples dating violence. Dating violence rates are not determined solely by belonging to a minority, ethnic, or national group. The reality of a given society at a given time affects the specific impact of any given variable on dating violence. Implications and recommendations for required policy changes and for further studies are suggested. [Copyright 2007 Elsevier Ltd.]

Abstract: The purpose of this article to present an in-depth analysis of the initial complaint to police as perceived by abused Israeli Arab women and their perpetrators. The research used in-depth, semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 20 Israeli Arab men and women. Findings indicated that women and men in Arab society in Israel are both caught in a struggle between two opposing forces: One is directed towards preserving traditional cultural codes and values concerning asymmetric gender relationships, emphasis on family values, honor, and the powerful delegation of conflict resolution to the extended family; the other expresses increasing awareness of women's right to oppose their own victimization by men and to make their own decisions. Implications for practice in the domain of social control and intervention with cultural minority groups are suggested. Adapted from the source document.

The Meaning of Being Incarcerated on a Domestic Violence Charge and its Impact on Self and Family among Latino Immigrant Batterers

Author: Saez-Betacourt, Alicia1; Lam, Brian Trung; Nguyen, Trent1 1250 Bellflower Blvd., Long Beach, CA 90890

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61404903?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explores how Latino immigrant male batterers make sense of their incarceration for domestic violence in the U.S. and its impact on their lives and on the lives of their family members. The convenient sample consisted of 15 Latino male immigrants, who were attending a batterers' intervention program in a metropolitan city in California. Seventeen semi-structured, open-ended questions were conducted with Latino immigrant batterers at a batterer treatment center in southern California. Anger, gender role, acculturation stresses, and lack of self-control were identified as the main themes leading to domestic violence. The respondents also reported a need to expand community education on issues of domestic violence. Findings of the study supported the important role of raising cultural awareness in addressing the batterers' attitudes and behaviors. In addition, findings of the study highlighted the concerns of the impact of criminal records on immigration status, employment, and family stability. Finally, results of the study raise the important issue pertaining to the role of victimized status in the batterers' self-concept. Implications for developing prevention and treatment programs are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Peer Intervention in Dating Violence: Beliefs of African-American Middle School Adolescents

Author: Weisz, Arlene N1; Black, Beverly M1 School of Social Work, Wayne State University, Thompson Home, Detroit, MI 48202

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61400885?accountid=14925

Abstract: This is a qualitative, descriptive study of 202 urban, African-American seventh graders that examines their views of peer intervention in dating violence. After viewing a video vignette showing friends confronting another male about abusing his girlfriend, the adolescents were asked to respond in writing to questions about whose business the violence was and whether they would get involved. The most popular answers were "I would not get involved," and "the violence was only the couple's business." Some adolescents worried that they might get hurt or make things worse by intervening, but some discussed sound plans for intervention. The findings suggest that adolescents need help in defining which situations merit peer intervention and in gaining skills to intervene safely and effectively. Adapted from the source document.

Relationship of Substance Use/Abuse with Psychological and Physical Intimate Partner Violence: Variations Across Living Situations

Author: Stalans, Loretta J1; Ritchie, Jennifer1 Department of Criminal Justice, Loyola University Chicago, 820 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61671186?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study addresses whether the relationship between illicit drug use/abuse measures and intimate partner violence (IPV) varies across socioeconomic status, racial status, and environmental indictors of a drug supportive culture. Data from 19,131 respondents who were living with intimate partners and had not been treated for a substance abuse problem in the last year and participated in the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse were analyzed. Marijuana use/abuse was a stronger predictor of IPV and psychological abuse for minorities, but was not a significant predictor of Caucasians' IPV. Marijuana use/abuse also was a stronger predictor of IPV for those having a low socioeconomic status, but indicators of a drug supportive culture did not moderate the relationship. Minorities' marijuana use/abuse increased their yelling and insulting behavior toward each other, and this psychological abuse mediated the effect of marijuana use/abuse on IPV. By contrast, stimulant use, sedative use, and alcohol abuse or dependence had independent direct effects on IPV after controlling for psychological abuse. Implications for research and policy are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

American Indian and European American Women's Perceptions of Domestic Violence

Author: Tehee, Melissa1; Esqueda, Cynthia Willis1 University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE, USA mtehee@email.arizona.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61648020?accountid=14925

Abstract: American Indian and European American women's definitions and perceived causes for domestic violence were examined. Attitudes towards violence and battering as it relates to the self were measured with two scales. As predicted, results indicated American Indian women and European American women held different conceptualizations of what constitutes domestic violence and different notions concerning the cause of domestic violence. Also, American Indian women were more attuned to external causes for violence, while European American women referred to internal explanations for such violence. Differences in social and psychological histories of violence and attitudinal orientations toward violence were indicated. Legal and health system changes are recommended in order to combat violence in Indian country. Adapted from the source document.

Drinking, Alcohol Problems and Intimate Partner Violence Among White and Hispanic Couples in the U.S.: Longitudinal Associations

Author: Caetano, Raul1; Ramisetty-Mikler, Suhasini; Harris, T Robert1 University of Texas School of Public Health, Dallas Campus, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd. Room V8.112, Dallas, TX 75390-9128, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61653684?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examines longitudinal associations between drinking, alcohol problems and male-to-female (MFPV) and female-to-male partner violence (FMPV) in a national sample of White and Hispanic couples in the United States. The study uses general population household survey longitudinal data collected in 1995 and in 2000. Subjects (18 years or older) constitute a random sample of married and cohabiting couples in the 48 contiguous United States. In 1995, a total of 1,635 couples completed the interview for a response rate of 85%. In 2000, face-to-face interviews were completed with 1,392 couples in their homes. The present analyses include 406 White and 387 Hispanic couples, who remained intact at the follow-up. Alcohol volume, alcohol problems, MFPV and FMPV in 1995 significantly predicted these same behaviors 5 years later. For White couples, female alcohol problems predicted FMPV in 1995. For Hispanics, female alcohol problems predicted FMPV only in 2000. The relationships between the three alcohol variables and MFPV and FMPV are not static, changing across ethnic groups over time. Findings suggest that once a behavior is present, it tends to be a strong predictor of that same behavior in the future. Adapted from the source document.

Understanding High-Stakes Decision Making: Constructing a Model of the Decision to Seek Shelter From Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Stork, Elizabeth11 Department of Organizational Studies, Robert Morris University, 6001 University Boulevard, Moon Township, PA 15108 stork@rmu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61436576?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violent events, options considered, commitment influences on the generation of options, and decisions to stay or leave for shelter were extracted from interview transcripts of 25 women living in a shelter. The purpose was to create a graphic representation of the model of the decision to seek shelter from intimate partner violence (IPV). Sequential decision problem models were constructed to illuminate the complexity of such a high-stakes, poorly structured decision involving conflicting goals and time pressure. The sequential structure of this behavioral decision problem is significant, partially explaining the many violent episodes and multiple attempts to leave that many abused women experience.

Reduction of Intimate Partner Violence in a Gay Couple Following Alcohol Treatment

Author: Hellmuth, Julianne C1; Follansbee, Katherine W; Moore, Todd M; Stuart, Gregory L1 U Tennessee, Knoxville

Abstract: Although intimate partner violence among heterosexual couples is a growing topic of investigation, there remains a critical deficiency in the amount of research on violence and relationship functioning in gay men. This article presents baseline and follow-up data on a case study examining the effects of partial hospital alcohol treatment on one gay couple. This information may be helpful in understanding the relationship between alcohol use, violence, and relationship functioning in this population. On the basis of past research involving heterosexual couples as participants, we predicted that subsequent to one patient receiving alcohol treatment: 1) alcohol consumption would be reduced; 2) there would be a reduction in the amount of psychological aggression between partners; 3) there would be a reduction in the frequency of physically violent episodes; and 4) an overall improvement in relationship satisfaction would be evident. The couple was followed-up 6 and 12 months following the patients alcohol treatment. The results indicate a decrease in alcohol use as well as reduced physical and psychological aggression, but no increase in relationship satisfaction. This case illustration may provide insight into the context surrounding intimate partner violence and relationship functioning in gay couples, with implications for further research and treatment.

Domestic Violence: The Untold Story

Author: Horton, Arthur11 Department of Social Work and Human Services, Lewis University, One University Parkway, Romeoville, IL 604462200

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61694113?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article highlights the problem of domestic violence and explanatory variables heretofore not fully addressed in the literature. It focuses on one urban area Chicago with an identifiable inner-city population. Risk factors for domestic violence are hypothesized. The article presents research involving regression analysis of data for the city of Chicago. Results indicate that domestic violence in this sample is impacted by teen births, demographics such as depopulation of the inner city, patterns of racial and ethnic segregation, but chiefly the effects of concentrated poverty.

Community Response and Needs of African American Female Survivors of Domestic Violence

Author: Gillum, Tameka L11 University of Massachusetts Amherst

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397283?accountid=14925

Abstract: Relatively few studies have looked specifically at the experiences and needs of African American women who are survivors of domestic violence. This study sought to find out from African American survivors (a) what their experience was with various community entities and (b) how they feel race may have affected these experiences. Results indicate a great deal of dissatisfaction with the services received as they attempt to escape and/or stay away from their abusive partners. This dissatisfaction was in large measure due to lack of cultural competence. Implications for service and suggestions for community entities are presented.

Lesbian Mothering in the Context of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Hardesty, Jennifer L1; Oswald, Ramona Faith; Khaw, Lyndal; Fonseca, Carol; Chung, Grace H1 Department of Human and Community Development, 263 Beview Hall, MC 180, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 908 South Goodwin, Urbana, IL 61801

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61781024?accountid=14925

Abstract: Twenty-four lesbian mothers (12 African American, 9 White, and 3 Latina) who had experienced physical abuse by a same-sex partner were interviewed. Three types of IPV were found: intimate terrorism, situational violence, and mutual violent control. Further, relationships between mothers/abusers, mothers/children, and abusers/children were examined. Regarding relationships with abusers, 71% of mothers reported lengthy sagas, 17% had worked it out, and 13% made a clean break from the abuser. Regarding relationships with their children, 48% of mothers hid the violence, 26% minimized it, and 26% openly communicated about the situation. Relationships between abusers and the mothers' children were found to be either co-parental (29%), playmate (21%), abusive (21%), or non-parental (21%). Correlations among relational and demographic variables were also examined. Adapted from the source document.

Sexual Assault within Intimate Partner Violence: Impact on Helpseeking in a National Sample

Author: Cattaneo, Lauren Bennett1; DeLoveh, Heidi L M; Zweig, Janine M1 Department of Psychology, George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, MSN 3F5, Fairfax, VA 22030

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61429872?accountid=14925

Abstract: Within intimate partner violence (IPV), sexual assault is often subsumed under the heading of physical abuse, but evidence suggests qualitative differences in outcomes when both types of abuse occur. This study explores the cumulative effect of sexual assault and physical abuse by a current or former intimate partner on helpseeking. Using a dataset of 1,072 IPV victims from 8 states, we found that women who had experienced sexual assault in addition to physical abuse (44%) used more help, but were also more likely to say that they did not seek help when they needed it. Among those who were aware of services, fear was the greatest obstacle to reaching out for help. Implications include the need for information on best practices in addressing the sequelae of both physical and sexual assault in victim service agencies. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence in the Evangelical Community: Faith-Based Interventions and Implications for Practice

Author: Ringel, Shoshana1; Park, Juyoung1 University of Maryland, Baltimore, School of Social Work, 525 West Redwood Street, Baltimore, MD 21209 sringel@ssw.umaryland.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61426639?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is a great deal of research on intimate partner violence, but few studies investigate the role of Evangelical religious and cultural values on intimate partner violence or faith-based prevention and interventions strategies in this community. This study with 8 Evangelical pastors and 11 clinicians contributes to the literature by examining the effect of religious values and social attitudes on intimate partner violence in the Evangelical community and investigating a range of faith-based interventions that may be utilized by mental health providers. The results focus on two themes: religious values and social attitudes and the use of faith-based interventions. Adapted from the source document.

Personal, Situational and Socio-Cultural Factors as Correlates of Intimates Partner Abuse in Nigeria

Author: Oladeji, David1; Adegoke, T G1 Department (Home and Hotel Management), (Child Development and Family Studies Unit), Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Nigeria

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61678756?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study investigated the relationships among personal, situational, and socio-cultural factors and intimate partner abuse among couples. A multiple regression statistical procedure was employed in analyzing the data collected from 200 participants randomly selected from five ministries in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Results obtained indicated that the three variables when combined effectively predicted intimate partner abuse. Taken separately, situational and socio-cultural factors did not. On the basis of these findings it was suggested that counseling psychologists should design intervention strategies to promote life-skills training in schools and out-of-school settings. These include age-appropriate content on sexuality, conflict resolution, building healthy relationships and personal safety. Also it was suggested that couples should be educated on the long-term health and social consequences of physical and sexual abuse. Adapted from the source document.

Evaluating Readability of Domestic Violence Information Found on Domestic Violence State Coalitions' Websites

Author: Yick, Alice G11 School of Human Services, Capella University, Glendale, CA 91206 alice@vs.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61493130?accountid=14925

Abstract: With the popularity of the Internet, more and more individuals are accessing health and mental health information from an array of websites. Yet, health literacy has emerged as barrier despite easier access to health information. The U.S. Department of Education (1986) stated that educational materials should be no higher than 8th grade reading level, yet, the reality is that often information written is above this level. This study examined the grade reading level and readability (as measured by the SMOG, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and the Flesch Reading Ease) of domestic violence materials on the websites of domestic violence state coalitions. Findings indicated that the average grade reading level of the domestic violence materials were statistically significantly higher than the 8th grade standard.

Author: AlMotwa, Mohammed Bin-Abdulla11 Dept Social Sciences, King Fahed Security Coll, Saudi Arabia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61696127?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study aimed at identifying the relationship between family violence towards children & their aggressive behavior in the secondary schools. It also aimed at identifying the relationship between the demographic variables & the family violence. Moreover, it aimed at identifying the statistically significant differences between aggressive & non-aggressive students according to the family violence level. The sample consisted of (320) male Saudi students in secondary school (the three levels: first, second & third) in Riyadh city, (158) of which were classified by the students. advisors & teachers as aggressive students, & the rest (162) were normal students chosen randomly. A questionnaire consisting of three parts was applied. The first part is devoted to the primary data. The second is devoted to family violence consisting of (19) statements. The third part is devoted to the aggressive behavior consisting of (30) statements. All parts were prepared by the current researcher. Afterwards, the data were analyzed. The most obvious results were as follows: First, there was a positive statistically significant relationship between the family violence & the aggressive behavior of students in their schools. Moreover, there were statistically significant differences between the aggressive students & the non-aggressive ones, benefiting the aggressive ones. Furthermore, there was a negative statistically significant relationship between some of demographic variables, namely father's education, father's income, & family violence. However, the study showed that there was no statistically significant relationship between mother's education & income, parents' work, & family violence towards children. References.

Barriers to Help-Seeking for Older Women Who Experience Intimate Partner Violence: A Descriptive Model

Author: Beaulaurier, Richard L1; Seff, Laura R; Newman, Frederick L1 School of Social Work, Florida International University, 11200 SW 8 St., GL 415, Miami, FL 33175

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61407911?accountid=14925

Abstract: Purpose: The paper describes a model of barriers to help-seeking (MBF.S) for older women who experience domestic violence (DV). Design and Methods: Data were collected from 134 women ages 45 to 85 years in 21 focus groups. Computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (ATLAS.ti) was used to organize transcript analysis and provided access to the quotations upon which codes, themes, relationship maps, and other elements of the analysis were constructed. Results: Twelve themes emerged that showed strong relationships with experience of DV and barriers to help-seeking concepts. The resulting model of barriers to help-seeking (MBHS) illustrates how identified internal and external factors interrelate with each other and with an abuser's behaviors to create help-seeking barriers. The model also reflects the determination that, for study participants, there was no discernable point where characteristics of the experience of DV ended and resistance to help-seeking began. Implications: Development of services specifically suitable to the needs and desires of older women who experience DV is vital. Professionals in all service segments must more fully understand the help-seeking barriers that older DV victims face. To this end, the research community is challenged to replace myths and stereotypes about the nature and prevalence of DV among older people with empirically derived knowledge.

Domestic Violence against Children. Explaining and Counteracting Strategies

Author: Yarskaya-Smirnova, E R; Romanov, P V; Antoneva, E P

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61675879?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article discusses domestic violence in different countries based on statistics of this horrifying event. The severe children's upbringing is only activated in certain countries. It is a known fact that the conditions of upbringing are constantly transferred from one generation to the next. The article provides the research that was conducted among 700 scholars who knew of families where violence was a normal event. Most parents assume that the physical punishment is a natural part of childrearing practices. The author then concludes that children involved in violence at home have a tendency to have serious behavioral deflections. L. Babiasz

Cigarette Smoking and Intimate Partner Violence Among Men Referred to Substance Abuse Treatment

Author: Easton, Caroline J1; Weinberger, Andrea H; McKee, Sherry A1 Department of Psychiatry, Division of Substance Abuse, Yale University School of Medicine SATU, New Haven, Connecticut, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61650073?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined differences between alcohol-dependent offenders of intimate partner violence (IPV) with and without current daily cigarette smoking. Eighty-five alcohol dependent men arrested for domestic and referred to substance abuse treatment were evaluated. A total of 71% of the participants reported current cigarette smoking. The groups were divided into daily smokers (n=52) vs. non-daily smokers (n=21). Daily smokers had significantly more days of alcohol use in the 28 days prior to starting treatment, significantly more ASI alcohol and legal severity, and significantly more participants with a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder compared to non-daily smoking alcohol dependent offenders of IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Screening for Domestic Violence in Public Welfare Offices: An Analysis of Case Manager and Client Interactions

Author: Lindhorst, Taryn1; Meyers, Marcia; Casey, Erin1 University of Washington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61676700?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite a high prevalence of domestic violence among welfare clients, most studies of the implementation of the Family Violence Option (FVO) under welfare reform find that women rarely receive domestic violence services in welfare offices. This study reviews findings from current research on the factors that improve the likelihood that women will reveal their domestic violence experiences to service personnel, and uses the guidelines drawn from this review to evaluate domestic violence screening practices in welfare offices using 782 transcribed interviews between welfare workers and clients from 11 sites in four states. The analysis found that only 9.3% of case encounters involved screening for domestic violence. Screening rates differed by state, interview type, and length of worker employment. Qualitative analysis of the interviews showed that the majority of screening by workers was routinized or consisted of informing clients of the domestic violence policy without asking about abuse. Only 1.2% of the interviews incorporated at least two of the procedures that increase the likelihood of disclosure among domestic violence survivors, suggesting deeply inadequate approaches to screening for abuse within the context of welfare offices, and a need for improved training, protocol, and monitoring of FVO implementation.

What We Know About Intimate Partner Violence in the Middle East and North Africa

Author: Boy, Angie1; Kulczycki, Andrzej1 University of Alabama at Birmingham

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61677621?accountid=14925

Abstract: Little is known about intimate partner violence in the Middle East and North Africa. This review synthesizes and critically evaluates the literature. Of 59 studies found, only 21 reported data on the prevalence of such violence or on beliefs regarding its justification, covering just 9 countries. Spousal abuse is pervasive and widely accepted. Victims are of all ages and are more likely to be rural and less educated. National data from Egypt and Jordan indicate almost 9 in 10 ever-married women accept at least one reason for wife beating. Change is possible but will require increased research, coalition building, and intervention efforts. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

Getting Beyond "What Did She Do to Provoke Him?" Comments by a Retired Judge on the Special Issue on Child Custody and Domestic Violence

Author: Fields, Marjory D11 New York Supreme Court

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61696420?accountid=14925

Abstract: Oftentimes, when men abuse their wives or the mothers of their children, we find ways to vindicate & help the men & blame the victims. We characterize these crimes as "social problems." We do not believe women victims of violence but instead believe the denials & justifications of male offenders (Sheehy, 2007). The research articles published in the special issue of Violence Against Women in August 2005 (Zorza & Rosen, 2005a), are studies of the impact of prior intimate partner violence (IPV) in court determinations regarding custody of & visiting with children. The studies show that courts ignore the risks of physical & mental harm to children & their mothers. Courts deny victims of IPV & their children protection & grant offenders visits or custody.

Profiles of Behavioral Problems in Children Who Witness Domestic Violence

Author: Spilsbury, James C; Kahana, Shoshana; Drotar, Dennis; Creeden, Rosemary; Flannery, Daniel J; Friedman, Steve

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61752965?accountid=14925

Abstract: Unlike previous investigations of shelter-based samples, our study examined whether profiles of adjustment problems occurred in a community-program-based sample of 175 school-aged children exposed to domestic violence. Cluster analysis revealed three stable profiles/clusters. The largest cluster (69%) consisted of children below clinical thresholds for any internalizing or externalizing problem. Children in the next largest cluster (18%) were characterized as having externalizing problems with or without internalizing problems. The smallest cluster (13%) consisted of children with internalizing problems only. Comparison across demographic and violence characteristics revealed that the profiles differed by child gender, mother's education, child's lifetime exposure to violence, and aspects of the event precipitating contact with the community program. Clinical and future research implications of study findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

A Test of Explanations for the Effect of Harsh Parenting on the Perpetration of Dating Violence and Sexual Coercion Among College Males

Author: Simons, Leslie Gordon; Burt, Callie Harbin; Simons, Ronald L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61417366?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study uses structural equation modeling (SEM) with a sample of 760 college males to test various hypotheses regarding the avenues whereby harsh corporal punishment and a troubled relationship with parents increase the risk that a boy will grow up to engage in sexual coercion and dating violence. We found that three variables-a general antisocial orientation, sexually permissive attitudes, and believing that violence is a legitimate component of romantic relationships-mediated most of the association between negative parenting and our two outcomes. In addition to this indirect influence, we found that harsh corporal punishment had a direct effect upon dating violence. The findings are discussed with regard to various theoretical perspectives regarding the manner in which family of origin experiences increase the chances that a young man will direct violence toward a romantic partner.

State Standards for Domestic Violence Perpetrator Treatment: Current Status, Trends, and Recommendations

Author: Maiuro, Roland D; Eberle, Jane A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61752831?accountid=14925

Abstract: We empirically surveyed and analyzed existing standards for the treatment of perpetrators of domestic violence across the United States. Specific areas examined included: presence and scope; administrative entity for certifying; screening and risk assessment protocols; minimum length of treatment; theoretical or conceptual orientation; treatment content; preferred or allowable modalities of treatment; whether research findings are mentioned; methods for revising standards; and minimum education and training required for providers. We examined trends using several methods including comparisons between present and previous survey data (Maiuro et al., 2001). Positive trends were evident including increased use of multivariate models of treatment content, use of an intake assessment prior to treatment, use of a danger/lethality assessment to manage risk, recognition of the need for program evaluation and supportive research, and the requirement of a minimum level of formal education as a prerequisite for providers. We identify specific areas for further research and development and make recommendations for improving existing practice and standards of care. Adapted from the source document.

Individual Treatment of Intimate Partner Violence Perpetrators

Author: Murphy, Christopher M; Meis, Laura A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61788067?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article outlines a rationale for investigating the individual (one-on-one) treatment format and individualized (case-tailored) services for partner abuse perpetrators. Many state standards caution against or prohibit individual services in abuser intervention. However, initial research indicates that motivational interviewing, conducted individually, can increase abusive clients' engagement in the change process. Challenges of using the group format in treatment development are discussed along with potential benefits of individual treatment for this population. Notably, individual treatment can be adapted to the client's stage of change, can address a range of presenting concerns (such as substance abuse and mood disorders) that may influence outcome, and can be used to focus clinical attention on case-specific change targets while avoiding potentially negative and antisocial peer influences in the group format. Nevertheless, individual treatment has been almost entirely ignored to date in clinical research with this population. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Risk Assessment and Management

Author: Kropp, P Randall

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61793110?accountid=14925

Abstract: While risk assessment is important in the management of intimate partner violence perpetrators, the science and practice of risk assessment in this field are still in early development. This article reviews the literature on intimate partner violence risk assessment. The original intent was to direct discussion to assist the Military Family Advocacy Program (FAP), U.S. Department of Defense, to develop guidelines for the treatment of domestic violence offenders. The article is divided into sections as follows: (a) Defining Risk; (b) The Risk Factors; (c) Models of Risk Assessment; (d) Existing Risk Instruments; (e) The Role of the Victim in Risk Assessment; (f) Qualifications to Conduct Assessments; (g) Communicating Risk; and (h) Managing Risk. Relevant issues and controversies are raised throughout the article. Adapted from the source document.

Substance Abuse by Men in Partner Abuse Intervention Programs: Current Issues and Promising Trends

Author: Bennett, Larry W

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61396844?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article discusses key studies linking intervention for co-occurring substance abuse and partner abuse. Findings are grouped into three areas: (a) the effect of addictions treatment on partner violence; (b) application of transtheoretical, motivational, and culturally focused approaches to improve engagement and prevent attrition; and (c) assessment-based matching of services. Finally, the relative value of serial, coordinated, and integrated substance abuse programs and partner abuse intervention programs are considered. We reached three primary conclusions: (a) Addiction treatment alone reduces the risk for future domestic violence in a subset of men who batter, (b) screening and assessment for substance abuse by all men in partner abuse intervention programs is a standard of practice but needs to extend beyond 'intake' and occur periodically, and (c) coordinated and integrated substance abuse and domestic violence programs probably offer more safety than traditional serial substance abuse treatment followed by partner abuse intervention.

The Significance of the Victim Advocate for Domestic Violence Victims in Municipal Court

Author: Camacho, Christina M; Alarid, Leanne Fiftal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61456032?accountid=14925

Abstract: Previous research has examined factors that influence felony case prosecution in domestic violence cases, but few have analyzed how victim participation, or lack thereof, may affect the defendant's case outcome in misdemeanors. This study used 384 municipal cases from a specialized domestic violence court to examine the role of the victim advocate and variables that had an impact on victim participation with prosecution and case disposition. To ensure that decisions in all cases were consistent, all decision makers in the sample involved the same group: the court advocate, prosecutor, and judge. The analysis found that victim cooperation after arrest coupled with services provided by shelter court advocates were a strong predictor of victim cooperation at disposition and case outcome. Adapted from the source document.

Correlates of Partner Abuse in Male Same-Sex Relationships

Author: Bartholomew, Kim; Regan, Katherine V; Oram, Doug; White, Monica A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61385482?accountid=14925

Abstract: We investigated correlates of partner abuse in male same-sex relationships in a randomly selected community sample (N = 186). We included factors associated with abuse in heterosexual relationships, as well as factors of relevance to gay relationships. We assessed perpetration and receipt of partner abuse to examine whether variables were associated independently with abuse perpetration and/or receipt. Correlates of same-sex partner abuse were largely parallel to established correlates of heterosexual abuse. Income, education, and attachment orientation were associated with bidirectional partner abuse, and family violence and substance use were uniquely associated with victimization. Further, there were factors unique to same-sex partner abuse; HIV status and public outness were associated with bidirectional partner abuse, and internalized homophobia was uniquely associated with abuse perpetration.

Abstract: Most U.S. intimate partner violence (IPV) research to date has been limited to women residing in urban areas, with the small body of research focusing on rural populations being primarily qualitative. In this case-control study of Southern rural women, while many factors are consistent with those found in urban settings, unlike findings elsewhere, IPV risk appears to increase with age, and race showed no increased risk. Furthermore, in rural areas where guns are more acceptable than in other parts of the United States, partners of IPV victims are considerably more likely to carry weapons than partners of nonabused women. Given the geographic limitations to police and medical response to severe IPV in a rural setting, an improved understanding of IPV risk among this population can aid health care providers in ascertaining risk before it escalates further.

The Transtheoretical Model in Intimate Partner Violence Victimization: Stage Changes Over Time

Author: Burkitt, Kelly H; Larkin, Gregory L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61790074?accountid=14925

Abstract: The transtheoretical model of behavior change (TTM) has been extended to describe the process of change in victims of intimate partner violence (IPV); however, it has not been validated over time or in a population of women experiencing IPV who are not currently in shelter. This article examines the process of change in IPV victims longitudinally and identifies factors that may relate to staging and stage progression. Fifty-three women were enrolled on presentation to an emergency department for health care treatment and completed follow-up at 3 to 4 months. Measures of TTM staging, use of community resources, ongoing abuse, mental health, and social support were collected. Cluster analyses were conducted, and descriptive summaries of clusters and significant demographic, abuse, and outcome variables related to cluster membership are presented. A five-cluster solution was selected on the basis of parsimony, theory, and overall coherence with the data. Forward progression through the stages over time was related to both the use of community resources and ending the IPV relationship. Adapted from the source document.

Acceptability of a Stage-Matched Expert System Intervention for Domestic Violence Offenders

Author: Levesque, Deborah A; Driskell, Mary-Margaret; Prochaska, Janice M; Prochaska, James O

Abstract: Most interventions for men who batter are standardized and 'one-size-fits-all,' neglecting individual differences in readiness to change. A multimedia expert system intervention based on the transtheoretical model (the 'stage model') was developed as an adjunct to traditional court-mandated programs. The expert system assesses stage of change, decisional balance, self-efficacy, and processes of change and provides immediate individualized stage-matched feedback designed to increase readiness to end the violence. Fifty-eight male batterer intervention program clients were invited by agency staff to complete an expert system session and an evaluation of the program; 33 men were recruited at program intake and the remainder from ongoing groups. Responses to the intervention were very positive. For example, 87% of participants reported that they found the program to be easy to use, and 98% said it could probably or definitely help them change their attitudes or behaviors. Findings provide encouraging evidence of the acceptability of this stage-matched approach to intervention for domestic violence offenders. Adapted from the source document.

Does the Transtheoretical Model Predict Attrition in Domestic Violence Treatment Programs?

Author: Brodeur, Normand; Rondeau, Gilles; Brochu, Serge; Lindsay, Jocelyn; Phelps, Jason

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61790157?accountid=14925

Abstract: Attrition in intervention programs for domestically violent men is considered to be a serious and enduring problem. Researchers have found a number of sociodemographic variables that partially explain this phenomenon; however, models based on these variables have a limited predictive power. Scott (2004) argues that a firm theoretical base is needed in future investigations of the problem and suggests the use of the transtheoretical model of behavior change (TTM), which was found to predict dropout with accuracy in other areas of behavioral change. This study investigated the relationship between four TTM constructs (Stages of Change, Decisional Balance, Self-Efficacy, and Processes of Change) and premature termination with a sample of Canadian French-speaking men (N = 302) in five domestic violence treatment programs. Contrary to the initial hypotheses, the TTM constructs did not predict dropout. Discussion investigates how social desirability bias affects results being obtained by current TTM measures and whether more motivation to change at intake necessarily relates to involvement in treatment for longer periods of time.

The Revised Safe At Home Instrument for Assessing Readiness to Change Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Begun, Audrey L; Brondino, Michael J; Bolt, Daniel; Weinstein, Benjamin; Strodthoff, Terri; Shelley, Gene

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61790254?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes the development and factor structure of the Revised Safe At Home instrument, a 35-item self-report measure designed to assess individuals' readiness to change their intimate partner violence behaviors. Seven new items have been added, representing content specific to the Maintenance stage, and other items have been revised to strengthen the assessment of earlier stages and address gender concerns. Confirmatory factor analysis using multisite data (two sites, a total of 281 men at intake) supported the conclusion that a four-factor model (Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation/Action, and Maintenance stages) was consistent with the observed covariances. A high degree of correlation between the Preparation/Action and Maintenance scales was observed, but subsequent testing indicated a need to treat the two as distinct factors in the model. It is recommended that scoring include only 31 items that perform well. Adapted from the source document.

A Comparison of Women Versus Men Charged With Intimate Partner Violence: General Risk Factors, Attitudes Regarding Using Violence, and Readiness to Change

Author: Simmons, Catherine A; Lehmann, Peter; Cobb, Norman

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61752934?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current descriptive study seeks to broaden empirical understanding about women charged with intimate partner violence by comparing a sample of women in a domestic violence diversion program (N = 78) to a matched sample of men (N = 78) in the same program on measurements of general risk factors, attitudes toward using violence, and readiness to change. Findings indicate that the women charged with intimate partner violence are a heterogeneous group, endorse risk factors that show an elevated likelihood they will continue to use violence, demonstrate a high level of tolerance for using violence in their relationship, and may be highly amenable to treatment opportunities. Implications for practice and future research are addressed. Adapted from the source document.

Police Officer Perceptions of Intimate Partner Violence: An Analysis of Observational Data

Author: Dejong, Christina; Burgess-Proctor, Amanda; Elis, Lori

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61790895?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores police officer perceptions of intimate partner violence (IPV) using observational data from police ride-alongs. We performed a qualitative analysis of narrative data from the Project on Policing Neighborhoods (POPN) to examine officers' views of IPV as well as whether policing philosophy is related to officers' attitudes toward IPV. Results indicate that POPN officers expressed problematic views of IPV (including simplification of IPV, victim blaming, patriarchal attitudes toward women, and presumption of victim noncooperation) as well as progressive views of IPV (including recognition of the complexity of IPV, awareness of barriers to leaving, and consideration of IPV as serious and worthy of police intervention). Additionally, our analysis offers tentative support for a relationship between policing philosophy and officers' attitudes toward IPV. While this study is largely exploratory, we address the implications of our findings both for police practice and training and for future research. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) has emerged as a serious problem among women in drug treatment programs. Research has underscored the importance of social support for abused women as well as women who use substances. Objectives The main objectives of this study were to describe the perceived social support levels and examine the associations between various forms of IPV and perceived levels of available social support perceived levels among a sample of women in drug treatment programs. Methods Face-to-face, structured interviews were conducted with randomly selected 416 women on methadone. Results The prevalence of physical, sexual, and injurious IPV in the sample was 39%, 31%, and 16% respectively, and the combined IPV prevalence was 44.5%. Findings from multiple linear regression models revealed that lower levels of perceived social support were significantly associated with physical aggression (^D*b = -4.71; p = .0001), sexual assaults (^D*b = -4.10; p = .003), and injurious attacks (^D*b = -4.03; p = .022). Respondents perceived highest levels of social support from their 'significant others' (mean = 5.64; standard deviation [SD] = 1.27) and lowest levels of social support from friends (mean = 4.20; SD = 1.48). The average network size was 2.7 individuals. Implications Findings from this study highlighted significantly lower levels of perceived social support levels for drug-using women in the context of IPV experiences. Interventions with these women should focus on strengthening social support networks that enable help seeking for both IPV and substance abuse issues.

'Why doesn't she just leave?': Belonging, disruption and domestic violence

Abstract: Synopsis From the 1970s, a feminist response to domestic violence in Australia was to assist women to leave their homes to escape domestic violence. In doing so, women's (and their children's) lives and their belongingness to place and to family were disrupted. Indeed, discourses about domestic violence assumed that women's lives would be disrupted. More recently, in Australia, legal and other reforms have allowed for the greater possibility of a woman remaining safely in her own home (and her violent partner being removed) and retaining some sense, at least, of her belonging to place. However, further significant policy and attitudinal change is required. In this article, I explore the gap between the experiences of women and the policies and legislation that have been in place to provide assistance and protection, and how this has changed over the past three decades. In particular, I examine what it means to leave home or to at stay home in relation to domestic violence and I consider what they mean in terms of belonging to family and to place.

The Domestic Violence Experiences of Women in Community Corrections

Author: Whaley, Rachel Bridges1; Moe, Angela M; Eddy, J Mark; Daugherty, Jean1 Assistant Professor of Sociology, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL, 62901

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61670940?accountid=14925

Abstract: A variety of studies indicate high rates of domestic violence in the backgrounds of women offenders. We examine and extend this work through a qualitative study of women on probation or parole in a western U.S. county. In-depth interviews were conducted with 14 women who participated in a larger study in which only questionnaire data were collected. Participants completed a brief telephone interview about prior experiences of partner violence and then a face-to-face extensive in-person interview. In the analyses, several notable themes emerged regarding the women's histories of child victimization, partner abuse, substance abuse, coercion into crime, and a lack of support services. Partner violence may play an important role in the genesis and maintenance of the criminality of a significant proportion of women, and should be acknowledged and addressed as part of programs intended to decrease recidivism.

Gender Differences In Intimate Partner Violence On Substance Abuse, Sexual Risks, And Depression Among A Sample Of South Africans In Cape Town, South Africa

Author: Wong, Frank Y1; Huang, Z Jennifer; DiGangi, Julia A; Thompson, Estina E; Smith, Brian D1 Department of International Health, Georgetown University of Nursing and Health Studies, 3700 Reservoir Rd., NW, Box 571107, Washington, DC 20057

Abstract: Because men account for nearly half of the HIV cases in South Africa, it is critical to understand the contexts in which they live and the behaviors in which they engage. The purpose of this study was to describe and examine gender differences in intimate partner violence on substance abuse, sexual risks, and depression among a sample of South Africans in Cape Town. We found that recent exposure to intimate partner violence among men was associated with all forms of drug use, whereas women who were recently abused were more likely to suffer from depression and problem drinking. We also found high levels of problem drinking among both men (58%) and women (42%). Men were more likely to use drugs. Exposure to community violence increased sexual risk behaviors among men. Overall, these gender differences have important implications for alcohol and drug prevention strategies as they relate to HIV transmission risk. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence among Midlife and Older Women: A Descriptive Analysis of Women Seeking Medical Services

Author: Sormanti, Mary; Shibusawa, Tazuko

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61428043?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although intimate partner violence (IPV) may occur throughout a woman's life course, there has been a paucity of research on the experiences of victimization among midlife and older women. This article examines both the prevalence of IPV among a sample of women ages 50 to 64 (N = 620), who were recruited at an emergency department and primary care clinics in an urban setting, and the associated factors for the subsample of these women who reported IPV (n = 34). More than 5 percent of the women reported experiencing some form of abuse by their partners within the past two years. Bivariate analyses comparing victims and nonvictims indicate that higher proportions of women who reported abuse had received public assistance and had a recent history of homelessness. In addition, victims of IPV reported higher frequencies of HIV risk factors than did nonvictims, including having a partner who insisted on sex without a condom, having sex with a man they knew or suspected was an IV drug user, and experiencing symptoms or receiving a diagnosis or treatment for a sexually transmitted infection. Significantly higher percentages of abused women reported being tested for HIV and being HIV seropositive. Implications of the findings for social workers are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Prevalence and Correlates of Intimate Partner Violence Among a Sample of Construction Industry Workers

Author: Cunradi, Carol B1; Ames, Genevieve M; Moore, Roland S1 Prevention Research Center, Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 450, Berkeley, CA 94704, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61657328?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study assessed the prevalence and correlates of intimate partner violence (IPV) among a sample of unionized construction industry workers, and tested the reliability of new measures of IPV normative beliefs. Study participants (n=100) voluntarily completed confidential and anonymous self-administered questionnaires that measured occupational factors, hazardous drinking, and normative beliefs. Measurement of past-year IPV was based on the Conflict Tactics Scale, Form R. Measures of IPV normative beliefs showed good reliability (Cronbach's ^D*a 0.94-0.95). Past-year IPV prevalence was 26%. Logistic regression models were developed to assess the contribution of each factor to risk of past-year IPV perpetration. Perceived workplace racial/ethnic discrimination, job strain, interpersonal workplace conflict, normative beliefs, and hazardous drinking were positively associated with elevated IPV risk. Construction industry workers may have higher rates of IPV compared to general population samples that represent various occupations and social classes. Occupational factors appear to be significant correlates of IPV among these workers. Adapted from the source document.

The Distinctive Characteristics and Needs of Domestic Violence Victims in a Native American Community

Author: Jones, Loring11 School of Social Work, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182, USA ljones@mail.sdsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61651887?accountid=14925

Abstract: The objectives of the research described in this paper were to describe specific features of Native American domestic violence (DV), and identify the needs and barriers to service delivery for American Indians experiencing DV. Qualitative methods of data collection were used in this research. The results suggest that DV in Native American communities may be distinct in a number of ways. The cause of Native American DV may be anchored in historic trauma, poverty, alcohol and drugs, and rural isolation. Cultural and economic features of Native American DV are discussed. The complexity of DV in the Native American community, its association with a number of co-morbid problems, suggests a multi-modal intervention approach and collaboration among a variety of professionals.

The Production of the 'Battered Immigrant' in Public Policy and Domestic Violence Advocacy

Author: Bhuyan, Rupaleem11 University of Kansas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61375506?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the context of U.S. public policy, battered immigrant signifies a person who is eligible to adjust his or her status under immigration law if he or she can demonstrate they have suffered domestic violence in the United States perpetrated by a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident. Among community organizers, the term battered immigrant signifies a broader range of people for whom legal immigration status plays a role in their options for safety planning and/or leaving an abuser, the potential threat of deportation, and the eligibility for public benefits. Based on an ethnographic study of domestic violence advocacy with South Asian immigrants in Seattle and around the United States, this article examines how the difference in signification has direct social and political consequences with regard to who may access the benefits and protection offered to victims of domestic violence in the United States.

Resistance Among Domestic Violence Offenders: Measurement Development and Initial Validation

Author: Levesque, Deborah A1; Velicer, Wayne F; Castle, Patricia H; Greene, R Neil1 Pro-Change Behavior Systems, Inc.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61422252?accountid=14925

Abstract: Batterers' resistance to traditional intervention programs has been well documented. Within a Transtheoretical Model of Change (stage of change) framework, a measure of processes of resistance was developed and administered to 346 adult male domestic violence offenders in treatment. The study yielded a 38-item measure that assesses eight dimensions of resistance: (a) System Blaming, (b) Problems with Partner, (c) Problems with Alliance, (d) Social Justification, (e) Hopelessness, (f) Isolation, (g) Psychological Reactance, and (h) Passive Reactance. The relationship between resistance and stage of change, time in treatment, and partner aggression are reported. Results suggest that we look beyond the most common forms of resistance (e.g., denial and victim-blaming) to identify and address other forms of resistance that may be more internally based and difficult to detect. The processes of resistance measure provides a tool for measuring those types of resistance. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2007.]

Does Judicial Monitoring Deter Domestic Violence Recidivism?

Author: Rempel, Michael1; Labriola, Melissa; Davis, Robert C1 Center for Court Innovation

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61687663?accountid=14925

Abstract: A growing number of courts mandate convicted domestic violence offenders to ongoing judicial monitoring. However, the effectiveness of monitoring has barely been examined with this population. Accordingly, matched samples were created between 387 offenders sentenced to judicial monitoring in the Bronx and 219 otherwise similar offenders whose sentences did not include monitoring. Propensity score matching techniques were used to balance the samples on arrest charges, criminal history, relationship to victim, and other case characteristics. The study found that judicial monitoring failed to reduce the re-arrest rate for any offense, for domestic violence, or for domestic violence with the same victim.

Findings From an Outcome Examination of Rhode Island's Specialized Domestic Violence Probation Supervision Program

Author: Klein, Andrew R1; Crowe, Ann1 Advocates for Human Potential, Inc.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61694367?accountid=14925

Abstract: An examination of specialized domestic violence probation supervision compared to traditional mixed case supervision of domestic violence probationers finds significant differences in several areas, including victim satisfaction, probationer accountability, and reabuse and rearrest rates. Lower-risk abusers, constituting almost half of the probation abuser caseload supervised by the specialized unit, were significantly less likely to be rearrested for domestic violence and nondomestic violence crimes than were those supervised in the traditional mixed caseloads. Victims' satisfaction appeared to be higher, and abusers were held more accountable. Researchers suggest what may account for these different outcomes and the limits of the specialized supervision program in affecting the behavior of high-risk abusers.

A Qualitative Study of the Activities and Outcomes of Domestic Violence Coordinating Councils

Author: Allen, Nicole E1; Watt, Kelly A; Hess, Jacob Z1 Department of Psychology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 603 East Daniel Street, Champaign, IL 61820, USA allenne@uiuc.edu

Abstract: Efforts to promote systems change frequently involve the creation of councils, coalitions, and other collaborative settings. However, research, to date, reports limited empirical evidence that they achieve desired outcomes (Roussos and Fawcett, Annu Rev Public Health 21:369-402, 2000). The precise nature of this evidence base has received less attention. In particular, formal investigations into council effectiveness (a) rarely highlight the specific nature of collaborative efforts; (b) emphasize fairly distal markers as the 'gold standard' for effectiveness; (c) focus largely on formative 'outcomes' (e.g., action plan quality); and (d) utilize primarily quantitative research approaches. The current study extends previous research by employing a qualitative approach to investigate the particular activities and proximal outcomes of 41 domestic violence coordinating councils. Study findings suggest that councils engage in six primary activities: discussing issues, sharing information, identifying weaknesses in the system's response, providing training for key stakeholders, engaging in public/community education, and lobbying key stakeholders who are not council members. Three proximal outcomes were consistently identified in council efforts: the promotion of knowledge, relationships, and institutionalized change. Attending more directly to proximal outcomes and concrete activities in our research has important implications for conceptualizing and researching the effectiveness of councils and collaborative settings.

The Canadian child welfare system response to exposure to domestic violence investigations

Author: Black, Tara1; Trocme, Nico; Fallon, Barbara; MacLaurin, Bruce1 Faculty of Social Work, University of Toronto, 246 Bloor Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A1, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61692853?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective While child welfare policy and legislation reflects that children who are exposed to domestic violence are in need of protection because they are at risk of emotional and physical harm, little is known about the profile of families and children identified to the child welfare system and the system's response. The objective of this study was to examine the child welfare system's response to child maltreatment investigations substantiated for exposure to domestic violence (EDV). Methods This study is based on a secondary analysis of data collected in the 2003 Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (CIS-2003). Bivariate analyses were conducted on substantiated investigations. A binary logistic regression was also conducted to attempt to predict child welfare placements for investigations involving EDV. Results What emerges from this study is that the child welfare system's response to EDV largely depends on whether it occurs in isolation or with another substantiated form of child maltreatment. For example, children involved in substantiated investigations that involve EDV with another form of substantiated maltreatment are almost four times more likely than investigations involving only EDV to be placed in a child welfare setting (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 3.87, p < .001). Conclusions These findings suggest that the involvement of child welfare has not resulted in the widespread placement of children exposed to domestic violence. The Canadian child welfare system is substantiating EDV at a high rate but is concluding that these families do not require child protection services. Practice implications There is debate in the literature about how the child welfare sector should respond to cases involving exposure to domestic violence. Contrary to conventional wisdom, this study finds that children who are the subject of investigations involving substantiated exposure to domestic violence are less likely to be removed from their home than children experiencing other forms of maltreatment. Strategies need to be developed to counter misperceptions about the intrusiveness of child welfare, and discussions need to take place about when it is appropriate for child welfare to become involved when children are exposed to domestic violence.

Intimate partner violence: Persistence of myths and implications for intervention

Author: Ehrensaft, Miriam K11 Department of Psychology, John Jay College of Criminal Justice, New York, NY, United States mehrensaft@jjay.cuny.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61406597?accountid=14925

Abstract: Since the issue of intimate partner violence first penetrated the realm of academia and policy some 30 years ago, the public has responded with the creation of hundreds of treatment centers, policy groups, advocacy groups, and public health campaigns [Pleck, J.H. (1987). The contemporary man. In, M. Scher, M. Stevens, G. Good, & G. Eichenfield, (Eds). Handbook of counseling & psychotherapy with men. (pp. 16-27). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications]. Almost all such programs are based on the first set of theories that lifted the problem of IPV into the public realm; these center on the role of patriarchal social norms in the etiology and maintenance of partner violence [Dobash, & Dobash, (1979). Violence against wives: The case against the patriarchy. New York: Free Press.; Walker, L. (1989). Psychology and violence against women. American Psychologist, 44(4), 695-702]. Yet, new data accumulating from numerous rigorously designed studies challenge existing theories, and are largely overlooked or discounted. This article reviews evidence that accumulating data countering the traditional theories is not penetrating the field in several critical arenas: 1) A developmental approach to partner violence is omitted from the field's mainstream lexicon; 2) The intersection of partner violence with other forms of family and non-family violence is underrepresented; 3) Partner violence prevention programs have limited effects, because they do not integrate accumulating data on relevant risk factors (mental health, poverty, etc.), focusing instead on universal prevention and gender-based interventions. The article overviews a program of research using longitudinal research methods to test prevailing theories and assumptions about partner violence. We draw from this evidence to recommend new directions for IPV research, and urge dissemination of the most recent, and often controversial, basic research findings to practitioners and academics.

Will she be safe? A critical analysis of risk assessment in domestic violence cases

Author: Hoyle, Carolyn11 The University of Oxford Centre for Criminology, Manor Road Building, Manor Road, Oxford, OX1 3UQ, UK Carolyn.Hoyle@crim.ox.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61402423?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes the emergence of risk assessment and management tools in the UK police response to domestic violence over the past few years and considers the potential and pitfalls of a risk management approach to domestic violence. The development of risk assessment and risk management, and the targeting of resources on high risk domestic violence cases, require a more strategic approach to domestic violence than was previously typical. The main purpose of risk assessment and management is to improve the protection of and interventions for families who are experiencing domestic violence, and to target interventions on those who present the highest risk. As risk is necessarily an unknown, risk assessments are social constructs, and yet they have significant practical and emotional implications for those deemed to be both at risk of being harmed and at risk of harming others. Therefore, the efficacy of risk assessment and management tools deserves critical attention. With risk and crime prevention there is always a balance amongst various interrelated factors, such as: deprivation of liberty; safety of all parties; availability of resources; and reduction of quality of life for perpetrators and their children. This article is based on analysis of policy documents, arrest statistics, a sample of 35 domestic violence victim safety plans, and interviews with senior police officers. It will draw on these resources to consider the extent to which police risk assessment and management in cases of domestic violence gets the balance right. [Copyright 2007 Elsevier B.V.]

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61406293?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this study, the researchers examined the associations among intimate partner violence & psychological functioning in 282 Latina women between 18 & 45 years. Participants were interviewed about demographic characteristics, experiences with physical, sexual, & psychological intimate partner violence, psychological symptoms, stressful life events, & childhood maltreatment. Physical violence was associated with symptoms of depression & hostility, & psychological abuse was related to depression, hostility, & somatization. Sexual violence was generally not associated with psychological functioning. The different types of intimate partner violence were not related to participants' self-esteem. Implications for interventions with Latina women are discussed. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Reconceptualizing and Operationalizing Context in Survey Research on Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Lindhorst, Taryn1; Tajima, Emiko1 University of Washington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61694062?accountid=14925

Abstract: Survey research in the field of intimate partner violence is notably lacking in its attention to contextual factors. Early measures of intimate partner violence focused on simple counts of behaviors, yet attention to broader contextual factors remains limited. Contextual factors not only shape what behaviors are defined as intimate partner violence but also influence the ways women respond to victimization, the resources available to them, and the environments in which they cope with abuse. This article advances methods for reconceptualizing and operationalizing contextual factors salient to the measurement of intimate partner violence. The analytic focus of the discussion is on five dimensions of the social context: the situational context, the social construction of meaning by the survivor, cultural and historical contexts, and the context of systemic oppression. The authors consider how each dimension matters in the measurement of intimate partner violence and offer recommendations for systematically assessing these contextual factors in future research.

Abstract: This study examines individual and partner characteristics associated with the perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) in young adult relationships with opposite sex partners. Using data from Waves 1 and 3 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study examined 1,275 young adults heterosexual romantic relationships. Controlling for the effects of family and school correlates measured in adolescence, we examined the extent to which participants general violent behavior in young adulthood and their partners use of violence in their relationship influence participants IPV perpetration. We found that both having general violent tendencies and being a target of violence in a relationship influenced ones likelihood of young adults perpetrating IPV. We also tested whether the overall influence of participants general violent behavior on IPV perpetration was moderated by their partners use of violence in the relationship.

Exposure of Elderly Persons to Family Violence

Author: Ajdikovic, Marina1; Rusac, Silvia; Ogresta, Jelena1 Dept Social Work, Faculty Law, U Zagreb, Croatia marina@dpp.hr

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61706922?accountid=14925

Abstract: Family violence against elderly persons is one of the complex challenges that modern society is faced with. There has been no systematic research of the family violence against elderly persons in Croatia so far. The aims of this research were: (1) to check the constructive validity of the Survey of the exposure of elderly persons to violence, which survey was designed to research the extent & forms of manifestation of the violence against the elderly in Croatia, & (2) to collect the first data on the violence against the elderly in Croatia. The research was conducted in the area of the City of Zagreb on an appropriate sample of 303 persons (23.4% of men & 76.6% of women) aged between 65 & 97. It has been shown that 61. 1 % of the respondents have experienced at least one form of family violence during the last year. On average, they mostly experienced psychical violence (24.1%), then material abuse (6.4%), physical abuse (4.4%) & sexual abuse (2.1%). The most frequent perpetrators include husbands (30.15%), sons (16.4%) & daughters (14.01%). The results have been discussed with the view of the future research studies of the violence against the elderly on representative samples in Croatia & the development of social policy of fighting violence against elderly citizens.

Male Perpetrators' Perspectives on Intimate Partner Violence, Religion, and Masculinity

Author: Levitt, Heidi M1; Swanger, Rebecca Todd; Butler, Jenny B1 The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA hlevitt@memphis.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61685059?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study examines the interaction of religious belief and intimate partner violence (IPV) by exploring the perspectives of twelve male IPV perpetrators in a lower socioeconomic bracket from the Southern US. Semi-structured interviews of perpetrators were conducted to ask about their experience with and perceptions of IPV in relation to their religious beliefs and the beliefs of others in their environment. A grounded theory method of analysis was used to develop a comprehensive, empirically-derived description of this interaction. Findings are discussed in relation to the construct of masculinity held by the perpetrators, which emerged as an important finding influencing both their thoughts about IPV and religion. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence And Pro-Arrest Policy

Author: Newbold, Greg1; Cross, Jenny1 School of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Canterbury, Christchurch

Abstract: Prior to the 1980s police in New Zealand, as in other Western jurisdictions, tended to adopt a minimalist stance to the treatment of domestic violence, with separation and mediation favoured over arrest. By the late 1960s, however, the "second wave" of the feminist movement had begun to have an impact on social attitudes, and from the early 1980s presumptive arrest strategies gained international popularity. Although research into the effectiveness of presumptive arrest has been inconclusive, New Zealand moved increasingly toward such a policy from 1987 onward. This paper discusses the progress and effects of various police initiatives in New Zealand's fight against domestic violence over the past 20 years, and argues that although a policy of presumptive arrest sounds attractive, there are good legal and practical reasons why the police have continued to exercise discretion in the way the policy is interpreted.

Ethnic Identity And Intimate Partner Violence In A New Zealand Birth Cohort

Author: Marie, Dannette1; Fergusson, David M; Boden, Joseph M1 Christchurch Health and Development Study, University of Otago, Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences, PO Box 4345, Christchurch, New Zealand Tel: +64 3 372 0406, Fax: +64 3 372 0407

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an issue of growing concern in New Zealand, with particular concerns being raised about the over-representation of Maori in surveys of IPV. The present study examined the associations between ethnic identity and IPV in a longitudinal birth cohort of individuals born in Christchurch in 1977. Those participants of Maori identity reported higher rates of both IPV victimisation and perpetration than non-Maori, as well as higher rates of injury related to IPV. Control for a range of socio-economic and family functioning factors reduced the magnitude of the associations between ethnic identity and IPV victimisation, perpetration and injury, but the associations remained substantial. It was concluded that higher rates of IPV among Maori were not explained by cultural factors, and were largely explained by ethnic differences in exposure to socio-economic factors and exposure to family problems in childhood.

The long-term effects of intimate partner violence on adolescent mothers' depressive symptoms

Author: Lindhorst, Taryn1; Oxford, Monica1 University of Washington, School of Social Work, 4101 15th Avenue NE, Seattle, WA 98105, USA tarynlin@u.washington.edu

Abstract: Adolescent mothers are at high risk of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) which may increase their likelihood of depressive symptoms in adulthood, yet little is known about the long-term effects of IPV on adolescent mothers' trajectories of depressive symptoms. The study reported here uses prospective data spanning 14 years from a study of 229 adolescent mothers from Washington State, USA to evaluate the effects of adolescent exposure to IPV on the trajectories of depressive symptoms over time, as well as the likelihood of depressive symptoms at age 28 years. After controlling for levels of economic insecurity, the results indicate that adolescent IPV and an early vulnerability to depression were significantly related to the intercept, but not the slope of the adult depressive symptom trajectories. Both cumulative and concurrent IPV predicted the likelihood of depressive symptoms at age 28 years. Follow-up analyses indicate that adolescent IPV is associated with greater levels of adult IPV, and that women who report both adolescent and adult IPV have the highest mean levels of depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that exposure to IPV in adolescence may alter the life course of young women, increasing their risk for continuing exposure to intimate partner violence in adulthood and its concomitant negative mental health effects. Efforts aimed at prevention and early intervention in IPV among adolescent mothers are important components of the clinical care of young mothers. [Copyright 2007 Elsevier Ltd.]

Dependent variables: Relationship violence in young adulthood: A comparison of daters, cohabitors, and marrieds

Author: Brown, Susan L1; Bulanda, Jennifer Roebuck1 Department of Sociology and Center for Family and Demographic Research, 222 Williams Hall, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH 43403, USA brownsl@bgnet.bgsu.edu

Abstract: Intimate partner violence is most common in early adulthood. A key developmental task of young adulthood is the formation of intimate partner relationships whether through dating, cohabitation, or marriage. Using the first and third waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examine the linkages between relationship type and relationship violence perpetration and victimization among young adults, emphasizing the mediating role of relationship commitment. Among women, cohabitors report significantly higher levels of relationship violence than either marrieds or daters. Among men, cohabitors and marrieds report similar levels of relationship violence and both groups experience more violence perpetration and victimization than daters. Our hypothesis that the weaker relationship commitment of cohabitors accounts for their higher levels of violence is not supported. [Copyright 2007 Elsevier Inc.]

Researching Same Sex Domestic Violence: Constructing a Survey Methodology

Author: McCarry, Melanie1; Hester, Marianne; Donovan, Catherine1 U Bristol

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61663345?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article discusses the issues and problems that need to be addressed in the development of a comprehensive survey approach to explore same sex domestic violence in relationships involving individuals identifying as lesbian, gay male, bisexual, transgender or queer (LGBT&Q). It draws on the most detailed study to date in the UK comparing love and domestic violence in same-sex and heterosexual relationships. The survey methodology built on previous research, attempting in particular to overcome the limitations of earlier studies; and to produce data that could be compared with existing data on domestic violence in both heterosexual and LGBT&Q communities. The result was a questionnaire that reflected a wide range of abusive behaviours; examined impact of the violence alongside a quantification of particular acts; took into account experience of violence from a partner, as well as use of violence against that partner; and incorporated issues related to equality/inequality and dependency. The questionnaire was successfully distributed across the UK to provide a national 'same sex community' survey of problems in relationships and domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

Controversies Surrounding Mandatory Arrest Policies and the Police Response to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Leisenring, Amy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61669955?accountid=14925

Abstract: Since the early 1970s, the efforts of the battered women's movement have led to many changes in the criminal justice response to intimate partner violence (often referred to more broadly as 'domestic violence') in the USA. One important reform has been the implementation of policies that encourage or mandate the arrest of offenders. However, mandatory arrest policies have been hotly debated by scholars, activists, and criminal justice system officials. In this article, I review the recent changes to the ways in which police officers respond to intimate partner violence and discuss the controversies surrounding these changes in light of recent research. I briefly consider why the literature on this topic has produced such contradictory findings and I discuss several actions that need to be taken in order to improve police response to intimate partner violence and better meet the needs of battered women. Adapted from the source document.

Women's Acceptance of Intimate Partner Violence within Marriage in Rural Bangladesh

Author: Schuler, Sidney Ruth1; Islam, Farzana1 Empowerment of Women Research Program, Academy for Educational Development/ GHPN, 1875 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20009 sschuler@aed.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61669397?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence against women perpetrated by husbands and male partners occurs worldwide, and an increasing number of surveys indicate that it is widely condoned. This article presents findings from a 2002 survey conducted in six rural villages in Bangladesh suggesting that an extremely high proportion of women believe that husbands' use of violence against their wives is acceptable. To investigate the reliability and the psychosocial underpinnings of these survey findings, we also examine data from 110 in-depth interviews and 14 small group discussions. The results suggest that although most abused women in the study had resigned themselves to accept a certain level of violence, they did not condone it, and many abused women said that perpetrators of violence should be punished, and in some cases the punishments they suggested were harsh. We conclude by raising questions regarding the meaning of responses to commonly used questions intended to measure women's attitudes toward intimate partner violence and by discussing policy implications.

Abstract: Female same-sex intimate partner violence (FSSIPV) is a serious problem that affects the health and safety of lesbian and bisexual women. To begin to address the paucity of research, a mixed methods study was conducted to identify shared and unique risk and protective factors for FSSIPV. This article reports on qualitative findings related to the influence of gender role stereotyping on women's experiences of FSSIPV. Findings indicate that gender role stereotyping shapes women's experiences of FSSIPV by influencing individual, familial, community, and societal perceptions and responses to this phenomenon.

Women's Rights, Domestic Violence, and Recourse Seeking in Rural Bangladesh

Author: Schuler, Sidney Ruth1; Bates, Lisa M; Islam, Farzana1 Academy of Educational Development, Washington, D.C.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61665126?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article seeks to deepen understanding of the reasons that abused women in a resource-poor rural setting seek recourse so seldom and with so little success. Data from in-depth interviews and group discussions are used to explore the range of responses to domestic violence and to examine barriers to recourse seeking. Findings illustrate how the combination of poverty and gender inequality, inequities in the legal framework, and patriarchal attitudes and corruption in both formal and informal institutions at the local level discourage abused women from seeking recourse and decrease the likelihood of a favorable outcome when they do.

Exploring the Links Between Components of Coordinated Community Responses and Their Impact on Contact With Intimate Partner Violence Services

Author: Klevens, Joanne1; Baker, Charlene K; Shelley, Gene A; Ingram, Eben M1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61426705?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the 1990s, concerns with response fragmentation for intimate partner violence (IPV) led to the promotion of coordinated community responses (CCRs) to prevent and control IPV. Evaluation of CCRs has been limited. A previous evaluation of 10 CCRs funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed no overall impact on rates of IPV when compared to matched communities. However, there was great variability in the quality and quantity of CCR efforts between sites and thus potentially different levels of impact. This article establishes the impact of each of the 10 CCRs on women's past-year exposure to IPV and contact with IPV services and explores the associations between specific CCR components and contact with IPV services.

Acceptability Of Dating Violence Among Late Adolescents: The Role Of Sports Participation, Competitive Attitudes, And Selected Dynamics Of Relationship Violence

Author: Merten, Michael J11 Department of Human Development and Family Science, Oklahoma State University, 1111 Main Hall, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74106 michael.merten@okstate.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61421732?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study uses a vignette-based survey design to examine the relationship between both respondent-level and case-level characteristics and the acceptability of violence in dating relationships. Measures of sports participation, competitiveness, and the need to win (respondent characteristics) were administered to 661 male and female late adolescents. Participants also rated the acceptability of violence portrayed in a series of couple interaction vignettes varying along three dimensions: initiator act, recipient reaction, and initator-recipient gender combinations (case characteristics). Results from a multilevel analysis show that with regard to respondent characteristics, only the need to win is related (positively) to the acceptability of dating violence, not sports participation or competitiveness. With regard to case characteristics, recipient reaction has the strongest relationship, suggesting that how a victim of violence reacts may be a more important predictor (negative relationship) of the acceptability of dating violence than the initial act of violence. Overall, case characteristics explain three times more variation in the acceptability of dating violence than respondent characteristics (30% vs. 10%). Adapted from the source document.

Problem Gambling related to Intimate Partner Violence: findings from the Pacific Islands Families Study

Author: Schluter, Philip J1; Abbott, Max W; Bellringer, Maria E1 AUT University, Auckland, New Zealand

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61717063?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) and problem gambling are becoming increasingly significant public health issues, especially amongst Pacific populations within New Zealand, yet no general population studies have explicitly investigated the association between these factors. This study aims to determine whether problem gambling is an independent risk factor for IPV victimization in 700 couples with a Pacific infant, after accounting for problem drinking. Victimization of any and severe physical IPV was indicated for 33% and 18% mothers, and 38% and 22% fat hers, respectively. For mothers, 1% were classified as problem gamblers and 15% as problem drinkers, while for fathers, 2% were defined as problem gamblers and 26% as problem drinkers. In this first published study to simultaneously relate current problem gambling to IPV victimization in a general population, no association could be found. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate partner violence is as important as client violence in increasing street-based female sex workers' vulnerability to HIV in India

Author: Panchanadeswaran, Subadra1; Johnson, Sethulakshmi C; Sivaram, Sudha; Srikrishnan, A K; Latkin, Carl; Bentley, Margaret E; Solomon, Suniti; Go, Vivian F; Celentano, David1 Adelphi University School of Social Work, Garden City, New York, NY, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61418087?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objectives: There are no studies that examine street-based female sex workers' vulnerability to HIV from both clients and intimate partners. This study documents street-based female sex workers' experiences of client and intimate partners, examines the intersections of violence, alcohol use in condom use, and highlights survival strategies used to avert harm. Methods: Ethnographic data were collected from 49 female sex workers through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Results: Female sex workers experienced multifarious forms of severe client and intimate partner violence. Sexual coercion and forced group sex in the context of alcohol use posed formidable barriers for condom use negotiation. Further, traditional gender norms dictated women's inabilities to negotiate condom-use with intimate partners. However, there was evidence of adoption of successful survival strategies in the face of danger and women's positive evaluations of the benefits of sex work and their contributions to family well-being. Conclusions: Harm reduction efforts with female sex workers need to account for their vulnerability to HIV from intimate partners in addition to clients. HIV prevention programmes need to include male clients in order to reduce harm among street-based female sex workers. There is an urgent need to build on sex workers' strengths and involve them in designing individual level, community, and structural interventions that could help in reducing women's vulnerability to intimate partner violence and HIV in India.

Marital Satisfaction and Marital Discord as Risk Markers for Intimate Partner Violence: A Meta-analytic Review

Author: Stith, Sandra M1; Green, Narkia M; Smith, Douglas B; Ward, David B1 Family Studies and Human Services, 101 Campus Creek Drive, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA sstith@ksu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61669771?accountid=14925

Abstract: A meta-analysis investigating the relationship between marital satisfaction/discord and intimate partner violence (IPV) in heterosexual relationships was conducted with 32 articles. Overall, a small-to-moderate effect size (r=-0.27) indicated a significant and negative relationship existed between marital satisfaction/discord and IPV. Moderator analyses found no differences between effect size based on construct examined (discord or satisfaction). However, the magnitudes of observed effect sizes were influenced by other moderator variables, including the use of standardized versus non-standardized measures, gender of the offender and victim, role in the violence (perpetrator versus victim), and sample type (clinical versus community). The data suggests that gender is an especially important moderator variable in understanding the relationship between marital satisfaction/discord and IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence, Couple Interaction and Children's Health in Latin America

Author: Heaton, Tim B1; Forste, Renata1 Department of Sociology, 2033 JFSB, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT 84602, USA Tim_heaton@byu.edu

Abstract: This paper examines the relationships between several measures of couple interaction and children's health. We hypothesize that more maternal input in decision-making, joint discussion of health issues, and the absence of violence and male control are conducive to better child health. Mortality and nutritional status are used as measures of child health. Analyses are based on Demographic and Health Surveys in five Latin American countries (Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Haiti and Nicaragua). Violence is the best interaction predictor of poor nutrition and lack of female autonomy is the best predictor of higher mortality. Joint discussion of family planning and joint decision-making about household issues are also predictive of child health. Male controlling behavior did not have a strong relationship with health outcomes in most countries. Overall, findings indicate that positive couple interaction is associated with improved health outcomes for children. Adapted from the source document.

Effects of Perpetrator and Victim Gender on Negative Outcomes of Family Violence

Author: Howells, Nicolette L1; Rosenbaum, Alan1 The Center for the Study of Family Violence and Sexual Assault, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, USA nhowells@niu.edu

Abstract: Growing up in a violent home predisposes children to a host of behavioral and emotional difficulties. This study examined whether perpetrator and victim gender have an impact on depressive symptoms and aggressive behavior for victims of child physical abuse (CPA) and also with regard to witnessing interparental violence (IPV). This study also examined whether witnessing siblings being abused would elicit high levels of depressive symptoms and aggressive behavior. College students (n=675) were assessed for both exposure to IPV and child physical abuse prior to age 18. Participants completed measures of depression and aggression. With regard to victims of CPA, participants victimized by both parents and those victimized by mothers only had significantly higher levels of aggression. For depressive symptoms, females having both parents as perpetrators or fathers only had significantly higher depressive symptoms. With regard to witnessing IPV, being abused by both parents was associated with endorsement of more aggression and depressive symptoms. With regard to witnessing sibling violence, the results were similar to those found for victims of CPA. Adapted from the source document.

Mental Health Disorders and Functioning of Women in Domestic Violence Shelters

Author: Helfrich, Christine A1; Fujiura, Glenn T; Rutkowski-Kmitta, Violet1 Boston University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61667486?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study investigates the presence of mental health symptoms and disorders reported by 74 women in a domestic violence shelter and the impact of those symptoms on function in work, school, and social encounters. Findings are compared to estimates of U.S. women generally, based on a national sample of over 65,000 women drawn from the 1995 National Health Interview Survey. The sheltered sample presents significantly higher rates of mental conditions and functional impairments affecting their work, school, and social functioning. These women are also less educated and poorer and use more health services than the U.S. population. Mental health conditions must be identified in shelters to improve functioning and facilitate independence from abusers. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

Police Response to Domestic Violence: Making Decisions About Risk Management

Author: Trujillo, Monica Perez1; Ross, Stuart1 University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61681316?accountid=14925

Abstract: Assessing and responding to risk are key elements in how police respond to domestic violence. However, relatively little is known about the way police make judgments about the risks associated with domestic violence and how these judgments influence their actions. This study examines police decisions about risk in domestic violence incidents when using a risk assessment instrument. Based on a sample of 501 risk assessments completed by police in Australia, this study shows that a limited number of items on the risk assessment instrument are important in police officers' decisions about risk. Statistical analyses show that the victim's level of fear contributes to police officers' judgment on the level of risk and their decisions on which risk management strategy should be used. These findings suggest that research on police responses to domestic violence needs to pay greater attention to situational dynamics and the task requirements of risk-based decision making.

The Rosenzweig Picture-Frustration Study 'Extra-Aggression' Score as an Indicator in Cognitive Restructuring Therapy for Male Perpetrators of Domestic Violence

Author: Norman, Michael1; Ryan, Lawrence J1 Union Institute & University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61655960?accountid=14925

Abstract: It was hypothesized that male perpetrators of domestic violence in the early stages of a 1-year process of cognitive restructuring therapy would manifest on the Rosenzweig Picture-Frustration Study higher levels of extra-aggressiveness than in later stages of the therapy process. A sample of male batterers in the process of treatment took the Rosenzweig instrument. The resulting responses were rated by trained scorers. Chi-square calculations reveled that batterers in the first quarter of treatment manifested Rosenzweig responses indicative of extra-aggressiveness, whereas in the fourth quarter, batterers manifested Rosenzweig responses indicative of im-aggression. The data are discussed relative to implications for domestic violence treatment and the use of the Rosenzweig instrument as an index of treatment progress.

Cultural Models of Domestic Violence: Perspectives of Social Work and Anthropology Students

Author: Collins, Cyleste C1; Dressler, William W1 Case Western Reserve University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61432670?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study employed a unique theoretical approach and a series of participant-based ethnographic interviewing techniques that are traditionally used in cognitive anthropology to examine and compare social work and anthropology students' cultural models of the causes of domestic violence. The study findings indicate that although social work students and anthropology students share understandings of a general model of domestic violence, social work students agree on distinctive elements of this model that anthropology students do not. These findings are important in better understanding the role social work education plays in developing social workers' understandings of the roots of domestic violence.

Intimate Partner Violence in the United States: An Ecological Approach to Prevention and Treatment

Author: Shobe, Marcia A1; Dienemann, Jacqueline1 University of Arkansas, School of Social Work mshobe@uark.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61744236?accountid=14925

Abstract: Physical, sexual, verbal and economic abuse, also known as Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), comprise a major public health problem. IPV risk factors include poverty, stress, substance use, depression, and history of child maltreatment. Protective factors include human capital (functional health and work competencies/qualifications), social capital (formal/informal relationships and resources) and financial capital (income and assets). Traditional IPV initiatives focus on increasing social capital by changing the cognition and/or behaviour of victims or perpetrators and increasing legal sanctions and supportive resources. The proposed Asset Model of IPV Resolution extends the current model to include an ecological approach to the prevention and resolution of IPV. In addition to human and social capital development, the authors suggest financial capital development through Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) as one social policy initiative to support women at risk of or women who experience IPV.

Implacably Hostile or Appropriately Protective?: Women Managing Child Contact in the Context of Domestic Violence

Author: Harrison, Christine11 University of Warwick

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61696994?accountid=14925

Abstract: The United Kingdom has seen conflicting developments in safeguarding women's and children's safety when there has been domestic violence. Although criminal justice responses have improved, child contact arrangements following parental separation remain dominated by pro-contact models that fail to take full account of the impact of domestic violence. Drawing on qualitative research in U.K. child contact (visitation) centers, this article presents women's perspectives to demonstrate how family court proceedings and welfare practices marginalized violence and exposed women and children to further abuse. This builds on previous articles in the journal to show how, in the post-separation family, contact now constitutes a significant site for continuing violence.

Risk Factors for Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in St. Petersburg, Russia

Author: Stickley, Andrew1; Timofeeva, Irina; Sparen, Par1 Stockholm Center on Health of Societies in Transition (SCOHOST)

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61657629?accountid=14925

Abstract: This exploratory study examines which risk factors are associated with intimate partner violence against women in St. Petersburg, Russia. Women attending two crisis centers and a birthing house constituted the study sample. The male partner's frequent alcohol consumption and seeing his father hit his mother in childhood were associated with an increased risk of violence, whereas living in a communal apartment reduced the risk of intimate partner violence. The importance of crisis centers in Russia is highlighted by the study, as the women who turn to them are likely to have experienced more severe forms of violence.

Toward a Balanced Approach: Defining Police Roles in Responding to Domestic Violence

Author: Balenovich, John1; Grossi, Elizabeth; Hughes, Thomas1 Department of Justice Administration, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40245, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61685024?accountid=14925

Abstract: Responding to domestic violence poses unique challenges to law enforcement officers. Prior research has focused on issues such as officer safety and arrest policies but overlooked a critical component-the officers' perception of their role in responding to domestic violence incidents. This study explores how police officers define their roles through the use of focus group interviews with detectives assigned to a domestic violence unit. Findings include the identification of three role perspectives. Recommendations for a more balanced approach of these role perspectives in responding to domestic violence crimes through the use of more effective training, supervision, and evaluation are proposed.

A Pre-Trial Domestic Violence Intensive Supervision Unit: Exploring Case Seriousness and Successful Disposition

Abstract: This study measures the seriousness of domestic violence cases from the population of cases (N=96) sentenced to a pre-trial domestic violence intensive supervision unit in one county probation office in Florida from April 1, 2006, to April 30, 2007. No significant differences were found in seriousness across sex, self-reported drug use, or attorney type. Furthermore, no relationship was found between the number of special conditions imposed by the court and the seriousness index value for a case. However, non-Whites had a significantly higher mean case seriousness index than Whites. Findings suggest that using the seriousness index presented in this study, some of the cases examined were not serious enough to warrant being sentenced to the pre-trial domestic violence intensive supervision unit. Implications for future research, including the use of lethality assessments, are addressed. Adapted from the source document.

Social Disadvantage and Family Violence: Neighborhood Effects on Attitudes about Intimate Partner Violence and Corporal Punishment

Author: Button, Deeanna M11 Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19711, USA dmbutton@udel.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61769342?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social disorganization theory asserts that neighborhood composition affects levels of violence within the community. The purpose of this article is to analyze the bivariate effects of social disorganization, crime, and collective efficacy, in addition to the individual factors of gender, race, and a history of child maltreatment, on the acceptance of using violence within the family. Data from the Norfolk Police Department (2000-2004), 2000 Census, and 2006 Norfolk Residents' Attitudes about Crime Survey were used to determine differences in approval of family violence. Results indicated that approval for family violence is an individual-level phenomenon as well as a community-level occurrence. Various aspects of family violence elicit different levels of tolerance by both micro- and macro-level characteristics. Implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Measuring children's exposure to domestic violence: The development and testing of the Child Exposure to Domestic Violence (CEDV) Scale

Author: Edleson, Jeffrey L1; Shin, Narae; Armendariz, Katy K. Johnson1 MINCAVA, University of Minnesota School of Social Work, 105 Peters Hall, 1404 Gortner Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55108, United States jedleson@umn.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61484546?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes the development and testing of the psychometric properties of a self-administered Child Exposure to Domestic Violence (CEDV) Scale. The 42-item CEDV was systematically developed using both pre-existing and newly developed items and subsequently subjected to a review and revision by an international panel of experts to establish face validity. After initial pilot testing, the CEDV was administered to 65 children, ages 10 to 16 years of age, who were receiving services from several domestic violence prevention organizations. The measure was administered concurrently with the Things I've Seen and Heard measure of violence exposure to establish convergent validity and again one week later to establish test-retest reliability. The CEDV appears to be a valid and reliable measure of the level of exposure to domestic violence from a child's perspective. The authors discuss potential uses of this scale and the development of resources to support the use of the measure, including an online version of the scale. [Copyright 2008 Elsevier B.V.]

Child welfare practice and policy related to the impact of children experiencing physical victimization and domestic violence

Author: Chiodo, Debbie1; Leschied, Alan W; Whitehead, Paul C; Hurley, Dermot1 The University of Western Ontario, 1137 Western Road, London, Ontario, Canada, N6G 1G7

Abstract: The impact of family violence on children seen in a children's aid society was investigated. Three groups of maltreated children were investigated: those exposed to domestic violence against women, physically abused, and children who experienced both. Child outcomes reflected behavioral and school-related problems, delinquency, and elevation in overall risk. There was considerable variability on the effects of exposure to children. Children exposed to domestic violence against women and children who were physically abused did not differ on a variety of child outcomes. Children experiencing the combined effects of physical maltreatment and exposure to domestic violence experienced the poorest adjustment reflected in grade repetition, involvement in delinquency, and on overall risk compared to physically abused or children exposed to domestic violence against women alone. Implications for child welfare practice and policy are discussed. [Copyright 2008 Elsevier B.V.]

The effects of self-protective behaviors on injury for African American women in domestic violence situations

Author: Wyckoff, Rachael1; Simpson, Sally S1 Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, University of Maryland, 2220 LeFrak Hall, College Park, MD 20742, USA rwyckoff@crim.umd.edu

Abstract: The stereotype of the strong, independent, and invulnerable African American woman may have implications in violent intimate partner relationships. More specifically, one behavioral manifestation of this stereotype is that African American women may be more likely to 'fight back' in domestic violence situations. However, little is known about the consequences of these self-protective behaviors for African American women. To this end, this study will address whether forceful and nonforceful acts of resistance result in the desired effect of avoiding injury. Using a sample of incarcerated African American women, this study examines the effects of self-protective behaviors on injury for a marginalized population at a high risk of violence.

Partnership or Palming Off? Involvement in Partnership Initiatives on Domestic Violence

Author: Welsh, Kirsty11 University of Sheffield

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61696413?accountid=14925

Abstract: One of the most striking features of government policy on domestic violence in the last decade has been the promotion of a partnership approach to the problem and, in particular, of partnership initiatives as the means to deliver the approach. Drawing on doctoral research, I suggest that these initiatives are largely attended by voluntary sector organisations and that, although some State agencies show a real commitment to attending, attendance from many State agencies is disappointing at best and is often mediated through the attendance of those with an interest in, and commitment to, the issue. I reflect on what this suggests about who, exactly, carries the burden of partnership responses to domestic violence and, moreover, what this suggests about the effectiveness and efficacy of such responses and their entitlement to such significance in government policy around the problem. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic violence and criminal justice training needs of social services workers

Author: Payne, Brian K11 Department of Criminal Justice, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30302, United States bpayne@gsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61710063?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence is a multifaceted problem that requires various agencies to work together to serve victims. Among other agencies that are involved in this collaborative effort, criminal justice officials must work with social services workers to ensure that cases are handled effectively. At the root of this collaborative effort, it is natural to question whether various parties have the knowledge needed to effectively respond to specific cases of domestic violence. In this study, attention was given to whether social workers possessed enough knowledge about various aspects of domestic violence, including information required to process domestic violence cases in the criminal justice system. In all, 186 social services worker supervisors in the Commonwealth of Virginia were asked to rate the level of knowledge they believed social services workers had regarding specific domestic violence topics with the level of knowledge workers they believed social workers needed regarding each domestic violence topic. Findings suggested that social services workers might have more problems dealing with the interpersonal nature of domestic violence cases than they do with the legal issues. At the same time, the supervisors suggested the workers knew less about specific legal options than they needed to know. Based on this, the authors suggest changes in training for all human services workers, including criminal justice officials and social workers. [Copyright 2008 Elsevier Ltd.]

Continuity and Pathways from Aggression in Childhood to Family Violence in Adulthood: A 30-year Longitudinal Study

Author: Temcheff, Caroline E1; Serbin, Lisa A; Martin-Storey, Alexa; Stack, Dale M; Hodgins, Sheilagh; Ledingham, Jane; Schwartzman, Alex E1 7141 Sherbrooke Street West, Py-170, Montreal, Quebec, H4B 1R6, Canada, carolinetemcheff@gmail.com

Abstract: Literature suggests that early patterns of aggressive behavior in both girls and boys are predictive of later violent behavior, including violence that takes place within family contexts. Utilizing the Concordia Longitudinal Risk Project, a study of individuals recruited as children in the 1970s from inner-city schools in Montreal, this study examined different pathways whereby aggressive behavioral styles in childhood may place individuals at risk for continuing patterns of violence towards children and spouses. Childhood aggression directly predicted self-reported violence towards spouse for both sexes, with indirect routes through lowered educational attainment and marital separation. Aggression in childhood was also found to predict parents' self-reports of using violence with their children. For mothers, educational attainment and current absence of the biological father from the child's home also played important roles in predicting violent behavior towards offspring. These findings provide evidence of both continuity of aggressive behavior and indirect risk paths to family violence, via lower educational attainment and parental absence. In both men and women, childhood aggression may be an identifiable precursor of family violence and child abuse.

Parenting Stress, Parenting Behavior, and Children's Adjustment in Families Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Huth-Bocks, Alissa C1; Hughes, Honore M1 Department of Psychology, Eastern Michigan University, 537 Mark Jefferson, Ypsilanti, MI 48197, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61678165?accountid=14925

Abstract: Children exposed to intimate partner violence are known to experience a number of negative outcomes, including behavioral and emotional problems; however, possible mechanisms accounting for this relationship are unclear. There is considerable evidence that parenting stress has a direct effect on child adjustment problems and on parenting behaviors; parenting behaviors, in turn, have been repeatedly shown to be related to child outcomes. The hypothesis that parenting mediates the relationship between parenting stress and child behavioral and emotional problems according to Abidin's (Journal of Clinical Child Psychology, 21:407-412, 1992) model was tested in a sample of 190 battered women and their 4-to-12-year-old children. No support for mediation was found for either mother- or child-reported outcomes. Parenting stress had a strong direct effect on child behavioral and emotional problems. These findings have implications for the viability of Abidin's model, as well as for interventions with battered women that address parenting stress. Adapted from the source document.

An Interactional Perspective of Intimate Partner Violence: An In-depth Semi-structured Interview of a Representative Sample of Help-seeking Women

Author: Vatnar, Solveig Karin Boe1; Bjoerkly, Staal1 Ullevaal University Hospital, Gaustad, Building 7, 0320, Oslo, Norway, solveig.vatnar@kompetanse-senteret.no

Abstract: This article reports a study of women victimized by intimate partner violence (IPV). We describe three interactional aspects of IPV: (1) responses and conduct before, during, and after IPV episodes, (2) impact of alcohol and drug intoxication, and (3) Predictors of risk for IPV victimization in more than one partnership. A representative sample of 157 help-seeking women, recruited from family counseling offices, the police and shelters, were interviewed about physical, psychological and sexual IPV. The nature and characteristics of the IPV interactions were complex and heterogeneous. There were significant interactional differences between the IPV categories concerning the women's responses and conduct before, during and after the IPV. The impact of alcohol and drug intoxication was relatively small on the occurrence of IPV. About 75% reported that neither the perpetrator nor the female victim had consumed alcohol or drugs before the index IPV exposure. Only 23% of the women had experienced IPV by previous partners. Women who had been subjected to sexual abuse in their family of origin were at almost 25 times increased risk of IPV victimization in more than one partnership. Childhood exposure to physical IPV between parents increased the risk of IPV victimization in more than one partnership significantly more than if the woman had been subject to childhood physical victimization.

Adult Attachment as a Risk Factor for Intimate Partner Violence: The 'Mispairing' of Partners' Attachment Styles

Author: Doumas, Diana M1; Pearson, Christine L; Elgin, Jenna E; McKinley, Lisa L1 Boise State University dianadoumas@boisestate.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61669027?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the relationship between intimate partner violence and adult attachment in a sample of 70 couples. The attachment style of each partner and the interaction of the partners' attachment styles were examined as predictors of intimate partner violence. Additional analyses were conducted to examine violence reciprocity and to explore differences in the relationship between attachment and violence using continuous and dichotomous violence measures. Results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated the 'mispairing' of an avoidant male partner with an anxious female partner was associated with both male and female violence. When controlling for partner violence, the relationship between attachment and violence was significant for males only. In addition, analyses using a dichotomized violence variable produced different results from analyses using a continuous violence measure. Clinical implications include focusing on the discrepancy between partners' needs for intimacy and distance within the couple as a strategy for treating intimate partner violence.

Intimate Partner Violence and Miscarriage: Examination of the Role of Physical and Psychological Abuse and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

Author: Morland, Leslie A1; Leskin, Gregory A; Block, Carolyn Rebecca; Campbell, Jacquelyn C; Friedman, Matthew J1 National Center for PTSD leslie.morland@med.va.gov

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61401905?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite research documenting high rates of violence during pregnancy, few studies have examined the impact of physical abuse, psychological abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on miscarriage. Secondary analysis of data collected by the Chicago Women's Health Risk Study permitted an exploration of the relationships among physical abuse, psychological abuse, PTSD, and miscarriage among 118 primarily ethnic minority women. The interaction between maximum severity of abuse and age provided the best multivariate predictor of miscarriage rate, accounting for 26.9% of the variance between live birth and miscarriage outcome. Mean scores of psychological abuse, physical violence, forced sex, and PTSD were significantly higher in the miscarriage group than in the live birth group. Women who experience physical violence and psychological abuse during pregnancy may be at greater risk for miscarriage. Prospective studies can confirm findings and determine underlying mechanisms. Routine screening for traumatic stress and PTSD may reduce rates of miscarriage. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

Intimate Partner Violence Among Pregnant Thai Women

Author: Thananowan, Nanthana1; Heidrich, Susan M1 Mahidol University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61393524?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purposes of this study are to describe intimate partner violence (IPV) among pregnant women in Thailand and compare maternal characteristics, health practices during pregnancy, and maternal health between abused and nonabused pregnant women. Of 475 pregnant Thai women, 13.1% report ever being abused, whereas 4.8% report physical abuse during pregnancy. Women abused during pregnancy, compared to nonabused women, are more likely to be younger, unmarried, have low income, be unemployed, and report that the pregnancy was unwanted. They also report lower levels of positive health practices and higher levels of depressive symptoms. Results demonstrate a need for screening of IPV among pregnant Thai women.

The legal consequences of intimate partner violence for men and women

Author: Felson, R B11 1012 Oswald Tower, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, United States, Rbf7@psu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/813080112?accountid=14925

Abstract: Activists claim that assaults on women by their intimate partners tend to go unreported, and that, when they are reported, offenders are treated leniently while victims are mistreated. I review a research program consisting of seven studies that examines whether assaults involving intimate partners have different consequences than other assaults, and whether these consequences depend on the gender of offenders and victims. The consequences examined include: whether the assault was reported to the police; the reasons the victim gave for reporting or not reporting; whether the victim signed a complaint; whether the offender was punished; and whether the victim was satisfied with the way the case was handled. The evidence does not support the idea that assaults by male partners are particularly likely to be underreported or treated leniently. Rather, the results suggest that offenders who assault women are more likely to suffer legal consequences than those who assault men, whether their victim is their partner or someone else.

Adolescent males' coping responses to domestic violence: A qualitative study

Author: Aymer, Samuel R11 Hunter College School of Social Work, 129 East 79th Street, New York, NY 10021, United States saymer@hunter.cuny.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61401856?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores the coping strategies of 10 adolescent males, ages 14 through 17, who were exposed to domestic violence perpetrated by a male parent. In-depth interviews provide the foundation for understanding their experiences, suggesting that environmental stressors, which produce psychosocial difficulties, warrant clinical intervention, and in turn influence coping. It is noteworthy that such behavioral problems, which are sometimes seen as pathological, can also be adaptive. [Copyright 2008 Elsevier B.V.]

Bridging the divide between child welfare and domestic violence services: Deconstructing the change process

Abstract: In spite of the long and well-documented history of tension between the domestic violence and child welfare systems in the United States, a number of communities have developed effective collaborations between the two in order to better meet the needs of families involved with both. After setting the historical context for the tensions between providers of child welfare and domestic violence services, the changing relationship between the two systems is examined from the perspective of professionals in both fields in one large urban community, New York City. Recommendations are made for continued progress. Communities seeking to improve their own response to the co-occurrence of domestic violence and child maltreatment may be able to gain from developing a broader understanding of the challenges and successes of the change process in a community which has struggled to improve collaboration.

From evolving discourses to new practice approaches in domestic violence and child protective services

Author: Friend, Colleen1; Shlonsky, Aron; Lambert, Liz1 CSULA Child Abuse and Family Violence Institute, Department of Communication Disorders, 5151 State University Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90032-8170-03, United States cfriend@calstatela.edu

Abstract: This article examines the evolution of the discourse surrounding domestic violence (DV), explores how that discourse intersects with public child welfare (PCW), and makes some suggestions for improving the quality and consistency of services for families involved with these systems in both the United States and Canada. In particular, the discourse at the intersection of the two systems has focused on whether or not children's exposure to DV is maltreatment and, further, if it warrants placement in foster care. Within the PCW system itself, data seem to point to divisions in worker beliefs over what circumstances necessitate removal of children and what solutions should be pursued in order to achieve permanence. Legislation and courts have spoken to this complex issue. Given the tension and new developments in the field, this article proposes that harm reduction (HR), evidence-based practice (EBP), and differential response (DR) approaches can bring the two systems together in order to better serve families.

What Accounts for Demographic Differences in Trajectories of Adolescent Dating Violence? An Examination of Intrapersonal and Contextual Mediators

Abstract: Purpose To identify intrapersonal and contextual factors that mediate associations between demographic variables (minority status, socioeconomic status, family structure, gender, and neighborhood disadvantage) and trajectories of moderate and severe physical dating violence perpetration from ages 13-19 years. Methods Multi-wave data from 959 adolescents were analyzed using formal mediation analysis in a multilevel analytical framework. Results Gender and neighborhood disadvantage were not associated with trajectories of dating violence, and therefore mediation was not examined for those variables. At all ages, minority adolescents reported perpetrating significantly more moderate and severe physical dating violence than non-minority adolescents. Destructive communication skills, acceptance of dating abuse, gender stereotyping, and exposure to family violence significantly mediated those associations. Parental education was significantly negatively associated with moderate physical dating violence. Acceptance of dating abuse, gender stereotyping, and exposure to family violence significantly mediated that association. At all ages, adolescents from single-parent households perpetrated significantly more severe physical dating violence than adolescents from two-parent households, but no variables mediated that association. Conclusions Each of the identified mediating variables is amenable to change through interventions targeted at high-risk subgroups of adolescents identified by these demographic characteristics.

African American Men and Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Smith, Earl11 Wake Forest University, Box 7549 Reynolda Station, Winston-Salem, NC 27109, USA smithea@wfu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61748461?accountid=14925

Abstract: Drawing on interviews with African American males in violent intimate relationships, this paper focuses on individual causes (exposure to violence), cultural causes (constructions of masculinity) and structural causes (unemployment and incarceration) of intimate partner violence (IPV) among African American men. IPV is 'triggered' by two threats to masculinity, though I focus exclusively on the first trigger (breadwinning). The analyses are framed by Merton's strain theory (1968) and his theory of unintended consequences (1976). I argue that at least for African American men, this framework when added to feminist theory and masculinity theory extends our understanding of battering, from the perspective of the batterer, beyond what other models have been able to accomplish. In short, from the point of view of many batterers, battering provides an accessible mechanism for African American men -who live in a social world plagued by a system of racial domination - to reassert their masculinity and thus maintain their male privilege and dominance in their heterosexual relationships. Yet battering has the unanticipated consequence of alienating them further from these same intimate partners, thus perpetuating the cycle of violence. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Preschoolers' Explicit Memory Functioning

Author: Jouriles, Ernest N1; Brown, Alan S; McDonald, Renee; Rosenfield, David; Leahy, Matthew M; Silver, Cheryl1 Department of Psychology, Southern Methodist University, P.O. Box 750442, Dallas, TX 75275-0442

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61697205?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research examines whether parents' intimate partner physical violence (IPV) relates to their preschoolers' explicit memory functioning, whether children's symptoms of hyperarousal mediate this relation, and whether mothers' positive parenting moderates this relation. Participants were 69 mothers and their 4- or 5-year-old child (34 girls). Mothers completed measures of IPV, children's hyperarousal symptoms, parent-child aggression, and positive parenting. Measures of explicit memory functioning were administered to preschoolers. As expected, IPV correlated negatively with preschoolers' performance on explicit memory tasks, even after controlling for parent-child aggression and demographic variables related to preschoolers' memory functioning. Preschoolers' hyperarousal symptoms did not mediate the relation between IPV and explicit memory functioning, but mothers' positive parenting moderated this relation. Specifically, the negative relation between IPV and preschoolers' performance on 2 of the 3 explicit memory tasks was weaker when mothers engaged in higher levels of positive parenting. These findings extend research on IPV and children's adjustment difficulties to explicit memory functioning in preschoolers and suggest that mothers can ameliorate the influence of IPV on preschoolers' memory functioning via their parenting.

Associations of Substance Use Problems With Intimate Partner Violence for At-Risk Men in Long-Term Relationships

Author: Feingold, Alan1; Kerr, David C R; Capaldi, Deborah M1 Oregon Social Learning Center, 10 Shelton McMurphey Boulevard, Eugene, OR 97401 alanf@oslc.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61652142?accountid=14925

Abstract: Associations of substance use problems in men -- defined as a man's meeting at least 1 criterion of dependence on each of a number of substances by his mid-20s -- with their perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) were examined in an at-risk community sample of 150 men in long-term relationships from their late adolescence to their late 20s. Men who had a problem with substances other than sedatives (especially cannabis and hallucinogens) committed more IPV than did men without such problems. Most of the men who had a problem with marijuana also had an alcohol problem, which explains why alcohol was found to have only an indirect association with IPV. The failure of previous alcohol-use studies to control for co-occurrence of alcohol and marijuana problems may explain the discrepancy with conclusions from past research that alcohol problems contribute directly to the perpetration of IPV.

Clustering of Adolescent Dating Violence, Peer Violence, and Suicidal Behavior

Author: Bossarte, Robert M1; Simon, Thomas R; Swahn, Monica H1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/809362029?accountid=14925

Abstract: To understand the co-occurrence of multiple types of violence, the authors developed a behavioral typology based on self-reports of suicidal behaviors, physical violence, and psychological abuse. Using a sample of dating adolescents from a high-risk school district, they identified five clusters of behaviors among the 1,653 students who reported being abusive or violent in the past year. Victimization and perpetration with same-sex peers and dating partners clustered together among the students who reported the highest levels of abusive (n = 357) or violent behavior (n = 146). These students also reported high levels of suicidal behavior. There were few significant demographic differences across clusters. The implications of the results for the need to design and evaluate efforts to prevent multiple types of violence are discussed.

Abstract: This study examines the association between intimate partner violence (IPV) and women's experience of interference with their attempts to avoid pregnancy among 353 women surveyed at reproductive health clinics throughout Jordan. Approximately 20 percent of respondents indicated that their husbands or someone else had interfered. Among those others than husbands who were identified, mothers-in-law were the most frequently mentioned, followed by the respondents' mothers and sisters-in-law. Multivariate logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders in determining whether each of the three measures of intimate partner violence (physical violence, sexual violence, and controlling behaviors) was significantly associated with having an increased risk of experiencing interference, as were several sociodemographic variables: nonconsanguineous marriage, residence with in-laws, and rural residence. Physicians, nurses, and family planning counselors must be made aware of the challenges that women may face from their families when they attempt to regulate their fertility.

Mental Health Consequences of Intimate Partner Abuse: A Multidimensional Assessment of Four Different Forms of Abuse

Author: Mechanic, Mindy B1; Weaver, Terri L; Resick, Patricia A1 California State University, Fullerton

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61478783?accountid=14925

Abstract: Battered women are exposed to multiple forms of intimate partner abuse. This article explores the independent contributions of physical violence, sexual coercion, psychological abuse, and stalking on symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression among a sample of 413 severely battered, help-seeking women. The authors test the unique effects of psychological abuse and stalking on mental health outcomes, after controlling for physical violence, injuries, and sexual coercion. Mean scores for the sample fall into the moderate to severe range for PTSD and within the moderate category for depression scores. Hierarchical regressions test the unique effects of stalking and psychological abuse, after controlling for physical violence, injuries, and sexual coercion. Psychological abuse and stalking contribute uniquely to the prediction of PTSD and depression symptoms, even after controlling for the effects of physical violence, injuries, and sexual coercion. Results highlight the importance of examining multiple dimensions of intimate partner abuse. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

Police Involvement in Cases of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women: The Influence of Perceived Severity and Personal Responsibility

Author: Gracia, Enrique1; Garcia, Fernando; Lila, Marisol1 University of Valencia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61662186?accountid=14925

Abstract: The influence of perceived severity and sense of personal responsibility of police officers on their level of involvement in cases of intimate partner violence against women is analyzed. Three levels of police involvement are considered: low, medium, and high. The sample consists of 143 Spanish police officers. A 2 x 2 x 3 factorial design is conducted to test hypotheses. Effects of perceived severity and personal responsibility are found only at the highest level of police involvement. For low and medium levels of involvement, no differences in perceived severity and personal responsibility of police officers are found.

Taking Child Abuse and Mothering Into Account: Intersectional Feminism as an Alternative for the Study of Domestic Violence

Author: Damant, Dominique1; Lapierre, Simon; Kouraga, Anne; Fortin, Andree; Hamelin-Brabant, Louise; Lavergne, Chantal; Lessard, Genevieve1 Universite de Montreal dominique.damant@umontreal.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61422914?accountid=14925

Abstract: Feminist scholars have been engaged in an ongoing debate to determine which theoretical perspective offers the best framework for understanding domestic violence, and this debate has been crystallized around two pole positions: radical and postmodern feminism. This article presents a journey throughout the development of a theoretical perspective for the study of domestic violence, child abuse, and mothering. It argues that the intersectional feminist perspective has much to offer these debates and that it constitutes a promising theoretical framework for understanding domestic violence that takes into account issues of child abuse and mothering.

Christianity and Domestic Violence: Feminist Poststructuralist Perspectives

Author: Wendt, Sarah11 University of South Australia sarah.wendt@unisa.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61405673?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research has shown that spiritual and religious identification plays a role in defining women's experiences of violence and therefore that social workers need to acknowledge and create safe spaces to talk about this identification. This article describes a rural Australian study that focused on the impact of a local culture on domestic violence, in which Christianity strongly influenced women's experiences of violence. It is argued that looking at women's experiences of domestic violence through a feminist poststructuralist lens is valuable because it provides a framework for exploring and sensitively challenging oppressive discourses that inform women's identities.

Bosnian Women and Intimate Partner Violence. Differences in Experiences and Attitudes for Refugee and Nonrefugee Women

Author: Muftic, Lisa R1; Bouffard, Leana Allen1 University of North Texas, muftic@pacs.unt.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810425240?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is increasingly viewed as a global social problem. Research examining this issue, however, generally has been limited to North America, leaving an extensive gap in the literature. This study aims to narrow this gap by examining IPV among Bosnian women. Specifically, an exploratory analysis will be structured around two important and interrelated areas: prevelance of IPV and attitudes related to IPV. Approximately 70 Bosnian women completed paper-and-pencil surveys that measured experiences and attitudes associated with IPV. Bivariate analyses were used to compare the responses of Bosnian nationals residing in Bosnia-Herzegovina (n = 49) against the responses of Bosnian refugees residing in the United States (n = 21). Results and suggestions for future research are presented.

Immigration, Masculinity, and Intimate Partner Violence From the Standpoint of Domestic Violence Service Providers and Vietnamese-Origin Women

Author: Bui, Hoan1; Morash, Merry1 University of Tennessee, Knoxville

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/810425068?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data from in-depth interviews with Vietnamese immigrant women residing in the United States and both interviews and a focus group with service providers for abused Vietnamese immigrants suggest a complex relationship among job market context, changing norms about appropriate feminine behavior, immigration adaptation, masculinity, and men's violence against intimate partners. During immigration resettlement, men's economic status can worsen, there can be gender role reversals, and men can feel a profound loss of power and social status. Aggression is one way to overcome the perceived loss of one form of masculine identity through a symbolic reassertion of power and privilege as it is constructed in Vietnamese culture and reinforced by aspects of U.S. culture. These dynamics suggest that interventions into domestic violence require not only increasing economic opportunities for immigrants to reduce adaptation stress but also changing gender relations that do not reproduce the belief in male supremacy and men's control of women as part of masculine identity.

Professionalizing Human Services: A Case of Domestic Violence Shelter Advocates

Author: Wies, Jennifer R11 Women's Center, Xavier University, Cincinnati, Ohio

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61652906?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recent decades have witnessed a shift in the provision of human services in America in multiple forms, including the work of caring for the elderly, people living with mental/physical disabilities, and other vulnerable populations. Using a case study of domestic violence shelter advocates, this paper explores the professionalization of advocating for and providing human services to victims of domestic violence. The introduction of the rhetoric of "boundaries" allows domestic violence advocates to justify separating their personal lives from their professional advocacy and reinforcing and unequal distribution of power between the advocates and the domestic violence victims. Furthermore, the domestic violence shelter organization acted to promote a message of professionalization to the advocates through an emphasis on credentials and previous work experience in a domestic violence shelter. Additionally, the domestic violence shelter advocates received a strong message in favor of professionalizing their work from the regional community of human service providers. As the local level response to domestic violence becomes increasingly professionalized, service providers negotiate professional expectations while struggling to provide human services to domestic violence victims. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The aim of the present study was to explore potential risk factors for severe physical victimisation in dating relationships of adolescent girls in the child protective system (CPS). A total of 196 adolescent Canadian girls within the care of the CPS completed questionnaires containing measures relating to dating and family violence, sexual history and socio-demographic variables. Results showed that the majority of participants had experienced some types of victimisation in their dating relationships, with 53.1 per cent reporting at least one severe physical victimisation experience. Results from bivariate analyses revealed that a history of child sexual abuse and school failure or dropout were not associated with dating victimisation. History of parental physical abuse, living outside the family environment before placement, age of first sexual relationship, number of sexual partners and having been pregnant were related to sustained severe physical dating victimisation. Logistic regression analysis indicates that all factors, save for number of partners and living outside family environment, contributed to the prediction of dating victimisation in multivariate analysis. Having been pregnant increased the odds of sustaining severe physical abuse more than threefold (by 3.60). Implications for intervention and further research are discussed. Accepted for publication April 2, 2007. Adapted from the source document.

Gender Differences in the Connections Between Violence Experienced as a Child and Perpetration of Intimate Partner Violence in Young Adulthood

Author: Fang, Xiangming1; Corso, Phaedra S1 National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford Highway, MS F-64, Atlanta, GA 30341, USA

Abstract: This paper uses longitudinal and nationally representative survey data to investigate the direct relationship between three forms of child maltreatment (neglect, physical abuse, and sexual abuse), and future intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration in the USA. We further examine the indirect effect that child maltreatment has on future IPV perpetration through the presence of youth violence perpetration, and the roles of socioeconomic factors on committing youth violence and IPV. Analyses indicate that gender differences exist for the developmental relationship between child maltreatment and young adult IPV perpetration, and the effects of socioeconomic factors on youth violence and IPV perpetration. For males, the direct effects of being neglected/physically abused as a child on IPV perpetration are not significant. However, the indirect effects of being neglected/physically abused on IPV perpetration through the presence of youth violence perpetration are significant. For females, the direct effects of being neglected/physically abused on IPV perpetration are significant. The indirect effect of being neglected on IPV perpetration is significant, while the indirect effect of childhood physical abuse is not significant. Childhood sexual abuse is not significantly directly associated with IPV perpetration for females; however, for males, it is the strongest (i.e., largest effect size) direct predictor of IPV perpetration. The indirect effects of childhood sexual abuse on IPV perpetration are not significant for both females and males. Adapted from the source document.

Does Intimate Partner Violence Epidemiology Differ Between Homes With and Without Children? A Population-Based Study of Annual Prevalence and Associated Risk Factors

Author: Bair-Merritt, Megan H1; Holmes, William C; Holmes, John H; Feinstein, Jamie; Feudtner, Chris1 Division of General Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61683489?accountid=14925

Abstract: We sought to determine whether intimate partner violence (IPV) risk factors differed depending upon the presence of children in the home, and to estimate the annual prevalence of IPV first in the general population and then in homes with and without children. We analyzed data from a cross-sectional random sample of 6,836 women in southeastern Pennsylvania interviewed by telephone in 2004. The magnitude of association between IPV and risk factors varied between homes with and without children for women's alcohol problems (with children, odds ratio (OR) 7.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9, 20.9; without children, OR 2.4; 95% CI 0.9, 6.0), and mental health problems (with children, OR 4.0; 95% CI 1.8, 8.9; without children, OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.6, 5.7). Poverty was significantly associated with IPV only in homes without children (OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.9, 7.2). Annual IPV prevalence was 1.2% overall, 1.4% in homes with children, and 1.1% in homes without children. One in 63 children lived in a home with IPV. Differences in IPV risk factors in homes with and without children suggest distinct underlying IPV mechanisms or consequences in these contexts. Adapted from the source document.

Gender Based Violence: Correlates of Physical and Sexual Wife Abuse in Kenya

Author: Kimuna, Sitawa R1; Djamba, Yanyi K1 East Carolina University, A-408 Brewster Building, Greenville, NC, 27858, USA, kimunas@ecu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811366951?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explored factors associated with physical and sexual wife abuse on a sample of 4,876 married women aged 15-49 years in the 2003 Kenya Demographic Health Survey. Results indicate that 40% of married women reported at least one type of violence; 36% were physical and 13% were sexual. Multivariate analysis showed that living in poorer households, being Christian, being in a polygamous marriage, having a husband who drinks alcohol, and being in sales, agricultural, or unskilled jobs significantly increased the wife's risk of physical and sexual abuse. Wife's education had significant effect on both physical and sexual abuse, but the relationships were not linear. Wife's age and number of children were significantly associated only with physical abuse; husband's education had a marginal but significant effect only on sexual abuse. Research implications are discussed.

Why Victims of Intimate Partner Violence Withdraw Protection Orders

Author: Roberts, James C1; Wolfer, Loreen; Mele, Marie1 Department of Sociology/Criminal Justice, University of Scranton, Scranton, PA, 18510-4605, USA robertsj7@scranton.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61432898?accountid=14925

Abstract: While reasons for returning to abusive partners have received considerable attention in research on intimate partner violence, few studies have examined the reasons why victims fail to follow through with the protection order process, regardless of whether or not they return to their abusive partners. Fifty-five women who were in the process of withdrawing a protection order against a male intimate partner were surveyed in the present analysis. Recognizing that reasons given for withdrawing a protection order often follow common themes, individual responses were organized into several 'domains,' or groupings of such reasons. The most commonly cited domain involved a 'concrete change' on behalf of the victim or defendant, which made the protection order less necessary in the victim's view. This was closely followed by the domain addressing emotional attachment to the abuser. Implications for future research and policy are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Collaborative Efforts to Improve System Response to Families Who Are Experiencing Child Maltreatment and Domestic Violence

Author: Banks, Duren1; Dutch, Nicole; Wang, Kathleen1 DB Banks Inc

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61684585?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Greenbook demonstration initiative provided federal funding and other support to six communities to establish collaborations to plan and implement policy and practice changes in systems that serve families who are experiencing domestic violence and child maltreatment or child exposure to domestic violence. The demonstration sites established and organized collaborative groups in accordance with the Greenbook foundational principles and recommendations, including representation from multiple levels within the primary partner systems and other organizations, as well as the community. The sites struggled with how to engage consumers of the primary systems, however, and devoted a great deal of time to understanding and addressing organizational differences among the partners. Other salient collaborative influences included leadership, resources, trust, and commitment. The stakeholders noted that the collaborative relationships required a great deal of work but were ultimately one of the main successes of the initiative.

Changing Policy and Practice in the Child Welfare System Through Collaborative Efforts to Identify and Respond Effectively to Family Violence

Author: Banks, Duren1; Landsverk, John; Wang, Kathleen1 DB Banks Inc durenbanks@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61418844?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Greenbook provides a roadmap for child welfare agencies to collaborate and provide effective responses to families who are experiencing co-occurring child maltreatment and domestic violence. A multisite developmental evaluation was conducted of six demonstration sites that received federal funding to implement Greenbook recommendations for child welfare agencies. Surveys of child welfare caseworkers show significant changes in several areas of agency policy and practice, including regular domestic violence training, written guidelines for reporting domestic violence, and working closely and sharing resources with local domestic violence service providers. Case file reviews show significant increases in the level of active screening for domestic violence, although this increase peaks at the midpoint of the initiative. These findings, coupled with on-site interview data, point to the importance of coordinating system change activities in child welfare agencies with a number of other collaborative activities.

Coordinated Community Response to Family Violence: The Role of Domestic Violence Service Organizations

Author: Malik, Neena M1; Ward, Kristin; Janczewski, Colleen1 University of Miami

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397838?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is increasing awareness that domestic violence (DV) and child maltreatment often overlap and that there are significant negative consequences to women and children who are victims in the same families. The present study contains data from a participatory evaluation of a multisite national demonstration project on family violence (the Greenbook Initiative), funded jointly by the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Justice. The goal of this initiative was to increase community capacity to assist dually victimized families. This article focuses on the DV service organizations in the demonstration with regard to collaborations with other agencies and work within the DV system to respond to dually victimized families. Findings suggest that DV agencies participated in leadership roles, cross-system collaborations, and cross-system trainings throughout the initiative. Within-agency practice changes were less apparent. Research and policy implications are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

Domestic Violence and Dependency Courts: The Greenbook Demonstration Experience

Author: Malik, Neena M1; Silverman, Jerry; Wang, Kathleen; Janczewski, Colleen1 University of Miami nmalik@med.miami.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61405423?accountid=14925

Abstract: This field study reports on a cross-site evaluation of dependency courts in communities receiving federal funding to implement the Greenbook initiative, a multisite demonstration for community improvement of coordinated responses to families victimized by domestic violence and child maltreatment. This article focuses on the dependency court, where child maltreatment cases are heard, specifically court participation in collaborative activities and court practice improvements. Findings indicate that perceptions of judicial leadership varied considerably by site. Cross-training appeared to increase over time, particularly with court staff. Collaborative efforts emerged across the Greenbook initiative with regard to the courts, and some innovative practices appeared within Greenbook sites, such as separate case plans for perpetrators and victims of violence in families, reducing the likelihood of controversial failure to protect charges. Results also highlight challenges inherent in changing court practices. Research and practice implications are discussed, focusing on relevance to other communities attempting to work collaboratively with the court system.

Substance Use by Women Using Domestic Violence Shelters

Author: Poole, Nancy1; Greaves, Lorraine; Jategaonkar, Natasha; McCullough, Lucy; Chabot, Cathy1 British Columbia Centre of Excellence for Women's Health, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61380268?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study investigated the connections between stressors, substance use, and experience of violence among women (N = 125) who accessed help from domestic violence shelters in British Columbia, Canada between October 2001 and June 2003. Changes in substance use and stressors following a shelter stay were explored, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Women generally decreased their use of alcohol and stimulants, and this change was found to be integrally connected to social and structural supports made available to them. Future research that augments current stress models of addiction by considering social and structural factors that come into play in women's substance use and domestic violence is suggested. The study's limitations are noted. Adapted from the source document.

When Will Adolescents Tell Someone About Dating Violence Victimization?

Author: Black, Beverly M1; Tolman, Richard M; Callahan, Michelle; Saunders, Daniel G; Weisz, Arlene N1 University of Texas at Arlington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61662222?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined factors that influence help-seeking among a diverse sample of adolescents who experienced dating violence. A sample of 57 high school students in an urban community reported on the prevalence and characteristics of dating violence in their relationships. Someone observing a dating violence incident and a survivor's attaching an emotional meaning to the event significantly influenced adolescents to talk to someone. When dating violence occurred in isolation, survivors were more likely to receive no support from others in the aftermath of the incident. Differences between boys' and girls' help-seeking and implications for dating violence intervention and prevention programming are discussed.

Child Protection Involvement and Victims of Intimate Partner Violence: Is There a Bias?

Author: Dosanjh, Sonia1; Lewis, Georgeanna; Mathews, David; Bhandari, Mohit1 Domestic Abuse Project

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61418887?accountid=14925

Abstract: Several studies have explored the disproportionate number of children of color involved in child protective services, raising concerns that racial bias in the system results in more women of color being referred to child protection. The authors conducted a case series to analyze whether a woman's race and ethnicity influenced referrals to child protective services in a domestic violence context. Data were obtained through interview records of 263 women (38% women of color) at a Minneapolis-based advocacy and therapy organization. The findings suggest that women who face multiple forms of oppressions may have greater risk of being involved with child protection services.

Does Health Care Provider Screening for Domestic Violence Vary by Race and Income?

Author: Weeks, Erin K1; Ellis, Shellie D; Lichstein, Peter R; Bonds, Denise E1 Wake Forest University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61402155?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence (DV) affects approximately 25% of women in the United States with approximately 5.3 million incidents each year. DV advocates and national medical associations encourage health care providers (HCPs) to screen patients. To determine DV screening rates by race and income, patient race/ethnicity, income, and receipt of and receptiveness toward screening were measured. Patient preference for screening did not vary by race and varied little by income, but experience with screening did. Practices serving predominantly African American and lower income patients screened at higher rates. These findings seem driven by practice factors rather than differential treatment of individuals. Future research should focus on why certain types of practices screen more than others. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

The Benefits of a Culturally Specific Intimate Partner Violence Intervention for African American Survivors: Notes

Author: Gillum, Tameka L11 University of Massachusetts Amherst

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61407788?accountid=14925

Abstract: In light of evidence and theorization of culturally specific factors contributing to intimate partner violence (IPV) within African American relationships and the Eurocentric approach many mainstream agencies take to service delivery, researchers have indicated a need for culturally appropriate IPV interventions for African American survivors to adequately address the issue of IPV within this community. The purpose of the current study was to qualitatively investigate how helpful a culturally specific IPV program, which targets the African American community, has been to African American female survivors. Results suggest that this culturally specific agency is successfully meeting the needs of these survivors. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]
