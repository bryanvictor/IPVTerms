Judges' Attitudes about and Experiences with Sentencing Circles in Intimate-Partner Abuse Cases

Abstract: During the 1980s and 1990s, two important changes that occurred in criminal processing were seemingly at odds for intimate-partner abuse cases. The first was the move to treat gender-violence cases more seriously and more punitively. The second was the design and implementation of restorative justice practices, which was mandated for consideration in First Nations cases in R. v. Gladue in 1999. There has also been an ongoing debate globally as to whether restorative justice is appropriate in gender-violence cases. Additionally, some First Nations scholars worry that restorative justice is simply another way of controlling and punishing Aboriginal peoples. This study draws on interviews with 27 judges in a large Western province, a year before the Gladue decision, regarding their attitudes to and experiences with sentencing circles in intimate-partner abuse cases. The findings suggest cautious judicial support tempered by serious concerns. Adapted from the source document.

Mental health needs of children exposed to intimate partner violence seeking help from mental health services

Abstract: The aim of this study is to examine whether children and adolescents exposed to interparental physical and environmental violence have specific needs when seeking public mental health services compared to non-exposed outpatients. The witnessing of intimate partner violence (IPV), psychopathology, functional impairment, and several individual and family variables were assessed in 520 children aged 8 to 17years. Results showed that living with violent parents at home increased the child's risk of posttraumatic stress disorder, dysthymia, self-harming behavior, and functional impairment. Exposed children's mothers were more likely to overprotect their sons, punish their daughters and report greater psychopathology, whereas fathers who engaged in marital violence displayed greater emotional distress and were more likely to punish and reject their children. The child's sex moderated the IPV effects on parenting, parental discipline, child's life events and health appraisal. Given the specific clinical profile of exposed children, mental health services should develop schedules to detect, assess, and treat these cases.

Risky Relationships?: Assortative Mating and Women's Experiences of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Carbone-Lopez, Kristin1; Kruttschnitt, Candace1 University of Missouri-St. Louis

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/743061451?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research indicates that female offenders are far more likely to have experienced intimate partner violence than women in the general population. Despite extensive research on women's pathways into offending, very little is known about why these women are at increased risk for partner violence. The authors use data from a sample of incarcerated women to explore various explanations for this association, paying particular attention to assortative mating patterns and the role of lifestyle. Findings indicate that, net of other risk factors, relationships with criminally involved partners increase women's risks of victimization. Such findings have implications for assortative mating theory, the study of female offenders, and studies of the community-level impact of incarceration.

Resiliency and Social Support Networks in a Population of Mexican American Intimate Partner Violence Survivors

Author: Roditti, Martha; Schultz, Pamela; Gillette, Madeline; de la Rosa, Ivan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/764415295?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article discusses research conducted with Mexican American female survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) and explores the survivors' capacity for resiliency and the nature of their social networks. The study used a nonprobability, convenience sample of survivors of IPV living in shelters in two southwestern border cities and asked these questions: How much is resiliency affected by mood? What parts of the IPV survivors' social networks are most supportive? Dependant sample t tests demonstrated that increased resiliency is associated with decreased mood disturbance. Ordinary least squares regression indicated that perception of social support is directly related to number of friends/neighbors and size of formal network. Implications for practice are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Feminist epistemology and the politics of method: surveying same sex domestic violence

Author: Hester, Marianne1; Donovan, Catherine; Fahmy, Eldin1 School for Policy Studies, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/754037816?accountid=14925

Abstract: The paper discusses the development and application of a survey questionnaire for researching domestic violence in same sex relationships. A feminist epistemological approach was used to construct an instrument geared to explore how processes of gendering and power might operate in similar or different ways in abusive lesbian, gay male or heterosexual relationships, while taking into account a range of domestically abusive behaviour, context and impact, experiences of abuse from partners and use of such behaviour against partners. The survey was part of a detailed multi-method study of love and domestic violence by intimate partners in same sex and heterosexual relationships (funded by the ESRC, award RES-000-23-0650), and also included focus groups and interviews. The paper outlines the development of the survey methodology, the high degree of reliability of the resulting instrument and shows the importance of the instrument and approach in providing a means for assessing 'severity of impact'. Adapted from the source document.

Who is better for handling domestic violence? A comparison between Taiwanese female and male Officers

Author: Sun, Ivan Y1; Chu, Doris C1 Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, United States isun@udel.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/754042062?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined Taiwanese female and male police officers' perceptions of handling domestic violence. Specifically, it assessed officers' attitudes toward whether female officers, male officers, or a combination of female and male officers are more suited for handling cases of battered women, offenders, and domestic violence overall. Survey data were collected from 96 female and 156 male officers from two police departments in Taiwan. Frequency distributions showed that a combination of male and female officers were most preferred by officers for handling abused women, offenders, and domestic violence overall. Regression analysis found that female officers were significantly more likely than male officers to favor a combination of male and female officers over female officers alone for handling battered women. Female officers were found to be more likely than male officers to favor male over female officers and a combination of male and female officers for handling offenders. Police supervisors' attitudes toward domestic violence also influenced officers' attitudes toward who is more suited for handling offenders. Implications for future research and policy are discussed.

The sex ratio and male-on-female intimate partner violence

Author: D'Alessio, Stewart J1; Stolzenberg, Lisa1 Department of Criminal Justice, Florida International University, United States

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/754042024?accountid=14925

Abstract: Two divergent perspectives have been articulated in the literature regarding the effect that an unbalanced sex ratio is speculated to have on male-on-female intimate partner violence. Evolutionary psychology proffers that a high sex ratio (i.e., more men than women in the population) propagates competition among males for female mates. This competition for female mates is thought to engender sexual jealousy among men, which in turn results in male-on-female intimate partner violence. In contrast, the Guttentag and Secord thesis argues that a high sex ratio acts to attenuate rather than amplify male-on-female intimate partner violence because the relatively small number of women in the population makes them more highly valued and respected by men. Using data culled from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and the Census, we investigate the relationship between the sex ratio and male-on-female intimate partner violence. We define male-on-female intimate partner violence as violence occurring within a marriage or boyfriend/girlfriend type relationship. Multivariate regression results furnish evidence supporting evolutionary psychology by demonstrating that a high sex ratio increases male-on-female intimate partner violence. Results also show that male-on-female intimate partner violence is higher in cities where more women work. Such a finding further buttresses the logic associated with evolutionary psychology because participation in the workforce is theorized to afford a woman a greater opportunity to meet and interact with men other than her husband or boyfriend.

Constructing a World Beyond Intimate Partner Abuse

Author: Flaherty, Maureen P11 University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada flaherty@cc.umanitoba.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992528?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner abuse (IPA) is a societal issue that continues to devastate individuals, families, and communities worldwide. Historical and current attempts to identify and eradicate IPA provide clues about what is working and what is not. Reflecting on written sources and more than 30 years of professional social service work, the author surveys the major causal theories of IPA and the continued devastating impact of IPA on women, men, and children throughout the world. The author's practice examples provide a commentary on the implications of IPA for citizens, human service practitioners, and policy makers. Building on the concepts of positive peace building through education and training, the author then challenges and provides suggestions for concrete changes that are necessary to move beyond attitudes and intervention/prevention strategies that continue to send the message that IPA is a personal rather than a societal issue.

Abstract: Determine the relationship between psychological and physical violence, exerted by fathers and/or mothers, and inter- or extra-familiar sexual violence with risk for consuming tobacco, alcohol and drugs among adolescents. A cross-sectional study was carried out with students in two secondary schools in Mexico City. A total of 936 students participated: 54.3% males and 45.7% females, ranging between 12 and 16 years of age. A self-administered questionnaire was applied. This included Strausatrade Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales, as well as instruments to evaluate sexual violence and substance use, among other components. Over half of the adolescents reported psychological or physical violence exerted by their parents, and 1 in 10, sexual violence. The proportion of use of the 3 substances was similar in both sexes. Logistic regression analysis for males showed that psychological violence, exerted by either parent, implied twice the risk for the victims to use tobacco. For males, having suffered sexual violence increased the risk of consuming drugs various times. For females, being a victim of multiple forms of violence within the family increased the risk of consuming tobacco, alcohol and drugs notably, in comparison to non-victims. Treatment programs for young people who have suffered family violence should consider adolescence not only as a stage of vulnerability for substance use but also as a critical time to implement preventive measures. For these measures, a joint strategy for both parents and adolescents should be considered, not only to stop the violence but also warn the parents about the serious consequences of the same.

Double risk: Immigrant mothers, domestic violence and public child welfare services in New York City

Abstract: This paper examines the experiences of Mexican immigrant mothers living in New York City who become involved with public child welfare services because of domestic violence and makes recommendations for evaluation of program services to immigrant mothers. A case study and the results of a focus group interview will be presented to illustrate the often conflicting cultural, social and political issues confronted by immigrant mothers as they negotiate the organization of services designed to address specific forms of domestic violence, i.e., the protection of children and the protection of women. Emergent themes point to the double risk faced by immigrant women-first at the hands of their partners and then by service providers who do not understand the cultural issues that surround domestic violence nor the implications that immigration status has for victims of abuse. After intervention, participants in this research study describe feeling both like 'bad mothers' who fail to protect their children and 'bad women' who turn family members over for deportation. Evaluation of services to immigrant mothers requires consideration not only of cultural and social issues that affect program outcomes but must also consider the larger implications that immigration status has on utilization of services by immigrant women. Immigrant women often face multiple risks when seeking help for family problems. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

"If There Was a Dire Emergency, We Never Would Have Been Able to Get in There": Domestic Violence Reporting and Disasters

Author: Houghton, Rosalind; Wilson, Thomas; Smith, Willie; Johnston, David

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/852900953?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examines domestic violence reporting in a community in New Zealand struck by a snow storm. Previous theory and empirical studies are discussed to provide context for the study being presented. The results are based on in-depth interviews with representatives of agencies involved in domestic violence response and emergency management as well as statistics and case file summaries from the predominant non-statutory domestic violence agency in the community. Interviewees were asked about domestic violence reporting and their awareness of any changes during the disaster. Changes were then measured against the statistics made available. Policy and planning in place at the time of the snow storm were examined to determine if agencies were prepared for any changes in domestic violence reporting in the aftermath of the snow storm. Issues that arose from a lack of planning or policy are discussed, and suggestions are made for improving both emergency management planning, but also the planning and policies of domestic violence agencies that must continue to provide services during disasters.

Evaluating Shame Transformation in Group Treatment of Domestic Violence Offenders

Author: Loeffler, Christopher H1; Prelog, Andrew J; Unnithan, N Prabha; Pogrebin, Mark R1 Odyssey Counseling, Denver, CO

Abstract: Offender rehabilitation, pitting the rational ability of criminal justice against the seeming irrationality of criminal behavior, remains controversial. Psychology highlights the importance of emotions in mediating individual behavior. Borrowing from restorative justice as a more emotionally intelligent form of justice, this article examines the role of shame and guilt in a domestic violence offender treatment program. The emotions are differentiated and then activated, similar to the use of reintegrative shaming in restorative justice, to promote greater offender accountability and empathy. Using a two-group comparison of male domestic violence offenders, measurements were taken on three sets of scales in assessing the outcome of the shame transformation process. Statistically significant effects were found for self-esteem and empathetic concern. Findings and future research are discussed.

Arrested Justice: The Multifaceted Plight of Immigrant Latinas who Faced Domestic Violence

Author: Vidales, Guadalupe T11 Criminal Justice Department, University of Wisconsin-Parkside, Kenosha, WI, USA vidales@uwp.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/754037609?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study documents and analyzes the experiences of Latina immigrants, predominantly Mexican women in Southern California, who faced domestic violence. Using a comparative case study methodology, the researcher conducted semi-structured interviews with residents of a battered women's shelter and professional service providers. The study also administered questionnaires detailing demographic and self-help behavior information, and descriptions of the multiple challenges faced by this population. Findings revealed multiple and intertwining barriers that were described as structural, cultural, and institutional. Some of the most salient obstacles includes: language barriers, gender and economic inequality, and lack of knowledge of laws and services that can support them. In order to better address the unique challenges faced by Latina immigrants who are survivors or face domestic violence, governmental, educational, medical, and social institutions should collaborate in developing community based cultural-competent programs and policies that integrate the intersecting needs of Latina women in these circumstances. Adapted from the source document.

Childhood Victimization and its Impact on Coping Behaviors for Victims of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Popescu, Marciana L1; Drumm, Rene'; Dewan, Smita; Rusu, Corneliu1 Graduate School of Social Service, Fordham University, 400 Westchester Ave., Room 128, West Harrison, NY 10604, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992294?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explores patterns of victimization and coping in a conservative Christian denomination. Four types of coping behaviors are identified: informal coping, professional help-seeking, negative coping and crisis outreach. While religious behaviors are less influential than expected for this particular population, current victimization and childhood victimization play a significant role in establishing a model of coping and help-seeking for intimate partner violence (IPV) survivors in faith communities. Childhood victimization acts as an aggravating factor, predicting negative coping with IPV. At the same time, childhood victimization significantly increases the likelihood of seeking professional help. The study adds to the body of knowledge by contributing to a better understanding of the impact of childhood victimization on coping and help-seeking. Adapted from the source document.

Future Law Enforcement Officers and Social Workers: Perceptions of Domestic Violence

Author: McMullan, Elizabeth C1; Carlan, Philip E; Nored, Lisa S1 Troy University-Dothan emcmullan@troy.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/754042920?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study compares perceptions of domestic violence for college students planning to work in law enforcement with students aspiring to careers in social work and non-law-enforcement criminal justice (N = 491). The study involves students attending four public universities across one Southern state who completed a survey (spring of 2006) measuring whether various scenarios were (1) related to domestic violence, and (2) worthy of being reported to law enforcement. Findings indicate that all student groups (law enforcement, non-law-enforcement criminal justice, and social work) tended to identify the various scenarios as domestic violence (and worthy of being reported) regardless of the person's sexual orientation, violence severity, and offender's or victim's gender. However, law enforcement students are less sensitive to domestic violence when compared with social work and non-law enforcement criminal justice students. Findings reveal that (1) graduate students, (2) female students, and (3) White students (compared with African American students in general) attending majority White universities were more likely to identify domestic violence and its worthiness of being reported. The data in this study indicate that criminal justice programs produce graduates who are reasonably sensitive toward the importance of appropriate domestic violence response but could still improve using the techniques employed within social work programs.

Parenting and Women Arrested for Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Simmons, Catherine A1; Lehmann, Peter; Dia, David A1 University of Tennessee, Memphis cathysimmons@utk.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/754042156?accountid=14925

Abstract: Exploring the relationship between parenting and women's use of violence the current study surveyed 106 mothers arrested for intimate partner violence (IPV) related crimes on parenting styles and attitudes toward when using violence against their partner is justified. Findings indicate parenting styles indicative of low belief in using physical discipline with their child/ children and an internal parental locus of control. However, a moderate to weak relationship between parenting styles and justification for using violence against a partner was also found. Although some support for the spillover theory is noted, results are far from conclusive. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Immigration and Intimate Partner Violence: Exploring the Immigrant Paradox

Author: Wright, Emily M1; Benson, Michael L1 Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208

Abstract: Recent evidence indicates that contrary to some criminological theories, immigrants are less violent than native-born Americans. The relationship between immigrant status and reduced violence appears to hold at both the individual and neighborhood levels of analysis. This phenomenon has been referred to as the immigrant or Latino paradox. It has been suggested, although rarely examined, that cultural differences and strong social networks among immigrants account for their lower violence rates. These factors even appear strong enough to counterbalance the crime-promoting effects of economic disadvantage. This study investigates whether such patterns extend to intimate partner violence. Consistent with research on other forms of violence, we find that neighborhoods with greater concentrations of immigrants have lower levels of intimate partner violence. This relationship appears to be partially mediated by cultural norms and social ties. Adapted from the source document.

To disrupt and displace: placing domestic violence on the public health agenda

Author: Vine, Michelle M1; Elliott, Susan J; Keller-Olaman, Susan1 Geography and Earth Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

Abstract: In 1996, in Geneva, the World Health Assembly declared the violence as a major and growing public health problem. Others have gone further in describing (sexual) violence against women as a weapon of terror. In the local community of Hamilton, Ontario Canada (population approximately 500,000), domestic violence represents 25% of the workload of the local police service. The literature has shown that violence in general, and domestic violence in particular, presents tremendous social and health impacts for individuals and communities. In this local community, however, an evaluation of a recently piloted cutting edge domestic violence response system highlights how difficult it is to place domestic violence on the policy and/or public health agendas. Qualitative interviews with 23 key stakeholders were undertaken to assess their views on the success of the program. While overall findings indicate that the success of this brief (11 month) pilot project was limited, important insights emerged around responding to the domestic violence issue, at the community level. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The present study explored whether the adverse mental health consequences of domestic violence victimization vary by type of loneliness (i.e., emotional and social loneliness). Participants were drawn from the Dutch city of Rotterdam (N?=?7072). Domestic violence victimization, emotional loneliness and social loneliness were associated with self-reported mental health. In addition, interaction effects were observed between domestic violence victimization and each type of loneliness. Implications for policy practice as well as strengths and limitations of the study were discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

Disparate Levels of Stress in Police and Correctional Officers: Preliminary Evidence from a Pilot Study on Domestic Violence

Author: Summerlin, Zachary1; Oehme, Karen; Stern, Nat; Valentine, Colby1 College of Social Work, Institution for Family Violence Studies, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758126349?accountid=14925

Abstract: New data from a prevention curriculum project on officer-involved domestic violence reveals significant differences in the reported job stress of Florida's correctional officers when compared to police officers who took the same surveys. The significantly higher reported levels of organizational stress in particular--especially those related to staff and resource shortages and attitudes about leadership--raise concerns about the relationship between organizational stress and the reported drastic budget cuts, hiring freezes, and layoffs experienced by the Department of Corrections in 2009. The surprising disparity has significant implications for policy makers, who should be aware of the high cost of stress in officer health and well-being when making budgetary decisions about the state's rapidly increasing inmate population. Adapted from the source document.

Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Reported by Homeless Youth in Columbus, Ohio

Author: Slesnick, Natasha1; Erdem, Gizem; Collins, Jennifer; Patton, Rikki; Buettner, Cynthia1 Ohio State University, Columbus

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758127569?accountid=14925

Abstract: No study to date has reported intimate partner violence (IPV) experiences among homeless youth. This study sought to uncover lifetime prevalence estimates of physical, sexual, and emotional IPV among a nonprobability sample of 180 homeless male and female youth in Columbus, Ohio. To that aim, self-reported IPV and the association between IPV and gender, race, age, and history of childhood abuse were examined. Results showed that physical violence and verbal abuse were the most commonly reported experiences of IPV in the current sample and ranged from 30.0% to 35.4%. Women and those with a history of childhood abuse were more likely to be victimized by their intimate partners. Specifically, multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that women were approximately twice as likely as men to be verbally and physically abused in intimate relationships. Moreover, youth who reported being victims of abuse in childhood were more than twice as likely to experience verbal abuse and physical violence in their relationships. Given the high lifetime occurrence of IPV among homeless youth, intervention efforts should target IPV to prevent future occurrence. Findings also suggest that intervention efforts should consider gender and history of childhood abuse. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Domestic Violence and Longitudinal Associations With Children's Physiological Regulation Abilities

Author: Rigterink, Tami1; Fainsilber Katz, Lynn; Hessler, Danielle M1 University of Washington, Seattle

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758126708?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study examined the impact of domestic violence (DV) on children's emotion regulation abilities measured via baseline vagal tone (VT). Specifically, the authors examined the relationship between DV exposure and children's regulatory functioning over time, investigating whether DV exposure was related to the trajectory of children's physiological regulatory abilities from the preschool period to middle childhood. Covariates, including marital dissatisfaction and conduct-problem status, along with potential gender differences, were examined. Though all children increased in baseline VT from Time 1 to Time 2, children exposed to DV displayed less increase in baseline VT over time as compared to nonexposed children. Results in terms of the long-term outcomes of DV on children and implications for interventions were taken into consideration and discussed in the article.

Abstract: Surprisingly, little is known about how IPV perpetrators perceive the conse quences of their violent behavior. This article describes the development and evaluation of the Perceived Consequences of Domestic Violence Questionnaire (PCDVQ). The PCDVQ is a 27 item self report instrument designed to assess the consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) as perceived by the perpetrator. Data from 124 nontreatment seeking, male, IPV perpetrators recruited from the community provided support for the internal consistency of the PCDVQ. Participants reported an average of 9.97 (SD = 4.57) consequences. Scores on the PCDVQ significantly predicted motivation for change, b =.19, t(113) = 2.03, p < .05, and treatment seeking, j super(2)(df = 1) = 10.79, p < .01, odds ratio = 1.27 (95% CI: 1.10 1.46). Clinical implications of this instrument are discussed.

Traumatic Stress Symptoms of Women Exposed to Different Forms of Childhood Victimization and Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Becker, Kimberly D1; Stuewig, Jeffrey; McCloskey, Laura A1 Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD kbecker@jhsph.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758129828?accountid=14925

Abstract: Interviews of women with (n = 193) and without (n = 170) recent exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) were used to examine how IPV and past exposure to child abuse influence self-reports of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The measurement of IPV included assessing psychological, physical, escalated physical, and sexual abuse. Women's retrospective accounts of childhood victimization included reports of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and witnessing domestic violence growing up. Each form of adult IPV showed an independent association with PTSD symptoms, as did each form of childhood victimization. In regression models including child and adult abuse together, adult IPV and childhood sexual abuse were related to PTSD symptoms, and adult IPV mediated the association between childhood physical abuse and adult PTSD. Tests of the interactions between childhood and adulthood victimization on PTSD symptoms were not significant. Findings are discussed within the context of a life-course perspective of trauma.

Size Does Matter: The Effects of Gender on Perceptions of Dating Violence

Author: Hamby, Sherry1; Jackson, Amy1 Department of Psychology, Sewanee, the University of the South, Sewanee, TN, 37383, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/852166866?accountid=14925

Abstract: Previous research has shown that people perceive intimate partner violence (IPV) as more serious in cases involving a male perpetrator and female victim versus other gender combinations. This study is the first to explore reasons for these differences. 181 undergraduates at a U.S. southeastern college rated one of four dating violence vignettes that varied by perpetrator and victim gender. Participants viewed male-on-female violence as more frightening primarily because males are stronger and bigger than female perpetrators. Physical differences were rated as significantly more important causes of fear than other personality/relationship dynamics. Because males are actually stronger and bigger than females, it appears that gendered perceptions of violence are based in real-world knowledge of gender differences, not merely gender stereotypes.

Domestic Violence Against Married Women in Egypt

Author: Yount, Kathryn M1; Li, Li1 Hubert Department of Global Health and Department of Sociology, Emory University, Druid Hills, GA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/808931059?accountid=14925

Abstract: We estimated the associations of social learning in childhood, marital resources and constraints, and community gender stratification and norms with women's risk of physical domestic violence in a national sample of 5,272 married Egyptian women. Women who experienced corporal punishment or maltreatment as children had higher odds of such violence. An increase in women's household-standard-of-living was associated with lower odds of such violence. Wives with unusually less and unusually more schooling than their spouse had higher odds of such violence, and the wives of paternal cousins had lower odds of such violence. Measures of community gender stratification and norms were inconsistently and weakly associated with such violence. Women's marital resources and constraints accounted for most of their risk of experiencing physical domestic violence.

Intimate partner violence and initiation of smoking and drinking: A population-based study of women in Yokohama, Japan

Author: Yoshihama, Mieko1; Horrocks, Julie; Bybee, Deborah1 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States miekoy@umich.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758123954?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is prevalent in the lives of women across the globe and has been found to be associated with substance use among women. As part of the World Health Organization's (WHO) cross-national research effort, this study examined the relationship between the experience of IPV and use of alcohol and tobacco among a probability sample of women aged 18-49 in Yokohama, Japan. Using retrospective data for 2000-2001, we employed methods of survival analysis that allowed an examination of the probability of initiating smoking and drinking subsequent to the experience of IPV. Experiencing IPV was associated with current smoking as well as initiation of smoking and current patterns of drinking. Women who had experienced IPV were more likely to be smoking at the time of the interview and tended to initiate smoking at earlier ages compared to those who had not experienced IPV. At any time point, the risk of starting to smoke was more than twice as high for women who had previously experienced IPV than for women who had not. In addition, women who had experienced IPV were more likely to drink heavily. The present studyatrades findings clearly point to the need to enhance coordination between IPV prevention and substance abuse programs in order to improve the safety and wellbeing of women who have experienced IPV.

Attitudes Toward Dating Violence Among Jewish and Arab Youth in Israel

Author: Sherer, Moshe11 Tel Aviv University sherer1@post.tau.ac.il

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758127930?accountid=14925

Abstract: The objectives of this research were to assess the attitudes toward dating violence among Jewish and Arab male and female adolescents in Israel. The random sample consisted of 1,357 participants from among 9th to 12th grade pupils enrolled in eight Arab and eight Jewish junior and senior high schools. The study assessed attitudes toward psychological dating violence, physical dating violence, and sexual dating violence. Although Israeli youths in general reported supportive attitudes toward dating violence, Jewish participants' attitudes reflect lower endorsement of dating violence than Arab participants'. On all three dating violence measures, females reported less endorsement of dating violence than males. The discussion focuses on explanations for the differences between the two national groups and genders and presents the theoretical and practical implications of the study.

Exploring the Impact of Displacement and Encampment on Domestic Violence in Kakuma Refugee Camp

Author: Horn, Rebecca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758123920?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper explores how conditions of life in a refugee camp contribute to domestic violence. It draws on the nested ecological model of domestic violence (Dutton 2001), which integrates individual and family factors, socio-economic context, and culture. Displacement depletes the resources available to refugees at each of these levels. Eighteen focus group discussions were held in Kakuma refugee camp (Kenya). Most displacement-related factors identified as contributing to domestic violence are consequences of the structural conditions of refugees lives. This suggests that systems for providing refuge have the potential not only to contribute to domestic violence, but to reduce it. Adapted from the source document.

Effects of domestic violence on behavior problems of preschool-aged children: Do maternal mental health and parenting mediate the effects?

Author: Huang, Chien-Chung1; Wang, Lih-Rong; Warrener, Corinne1 School of Social Work, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, 536 George Street, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, United States

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811033318?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using the first four waves of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, this article examined the effects of mothers who experienced domestic violence at Year 1 on the externalizing and internalizing behavior problems of children at Year 5 and investigated whether maternal mental health and parenting at Year 3 mediated those effects. Findings from structural equation modeling showed partial support for the hypothesized mediation effects. Consistent with the spillover hypothesis, domestic violence at Year 1 had a direct effect on maternal mental health at Year 3, which had direct effects on children's externalizing behavior problems at Year 5. Likewise, domestic violence at Year 1 had direct effects on parenting behavior and spanking at Year 3, and both parenting behavior and spanking then had direct effects on children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems at Year 5. Domestic violence at Year 1 had direct effects on children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems at Year 5. These results suggest that there are long-term effects of domestic violence on the behavior problems of preschool-aged children and that early interventions are needed to prevent later problems among children in families experiencing domestic violence.

Predicting dating violence victimization and perpetration among middle and high school students in a rural southern community

Author: McDonell, Jim1; Ott, Joyce; Mitchell, Margaret1 Institute on Family and Neighborhood Life, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758124928?accountid=14925

Abstract: Dating violence victimization and perpetration among young people in the rural South have been significantly understudied, despite evidence showing higher rates of dating violence in rural communities generally and in the southern U.S. states. This article reports the results of predictive models of dating violence victimization and perpetration among a convenience sample of middle and high school students in a rural South Carolina community. Logistic regression analyses showed that female victimization was predicted by knowing a female victim, substance use, attitudes towards violence, and grade level in school. Male victimization was predicted by knowing a male perpetrator, substance use, attitudes towards violence, and the acceptability of violence-related behaviors in the family. Female perpetration was predicted by knowing a male perpetrator, substance use, and attitudes towards violence while male perpetration was predicted by juvenile justice involvement, attitudes towards violence, and the acceptability of violence-related behaviors in dating and family relationships. Implications for further research and prevention efforts are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

Anger Control and Acceptance of Violence as Mediators in the Relationship between Exposure to Interparental Conflict and Dating Violence Perpetration in Mexican Adolescents

Author: Clarey, Amy1; Hokoda, Audrey; Ulloa, Emilio C1 Department of Psychology, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758123899?accountid=14925

Abstract: Dating violence is a prevalent problem in high school students. Previous research has found that anger expression styles and acceptance of violence beliefs mediate the relationship between experiencing family violence and dating violence perpetration. Few studies have examined the intergenerational transmission of violence theory in predicting dating violence in Mexican teens. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships among exposure to interparental violence, anger expression, acceptance of violence beliefs, and perpetration of teen dating violence in Mexican teens. Surveys were administered to 204 high school students (aged 15 to 17) from Monterrey, Mexico. Regression analyses revealed that anger control and acceptance of violence beliefs, mediated the relationship between interparental conflict and dating violence perpetration. These results support the use of family-based interventions that challenge acceptance of violence beliefs and teach anger control techniques in Mexican teens. Adapted from the source document.

A Comparison of Victimization and Perpetration of Intimate Partner Violence Among Drug Abusing Heterosexual and Lesbian Women

Author: Stevens, Sally1; Korchmaros, Josephine D; Miller, Delaina1 Southwest Institute for Research on Women, Women's Studies Department, University of Arizona, P.O. Box 210438, Tucson, AZ 85721-0438, USA sstevens@email.arizona.edu

Abstract: The study describes types and rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) reported by active drug using women enrolled in a street outreach HIV prevention research study located in Tucson, Arizona. IPV data were collected on 434 women at the baseline assessment who reported being in a current intimate partner relationship. The data collected included types of violence as well as rates of victimization and perpetration of IPV. Using profile analysis, we examined similarities and differences in patterns of incidence rates of both victimization and perpetration of IPV across different IPV behaviors experienced by heterosexual and lesbian women. Results indicate substantial rates of IPV among both heterosexual and lesbian women with both similarities and differences in IPV behaviors reported. Results suggest that type of relationship and type of IPV behavior are important factors in identifying and preventing IPV, and improving interventions aimed at addressing IPV.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to determine childhood trauma, the type of marriage, and level of self-esteem as correlates of domestic violence in married women in Turkey. The study sample consisted of 750 women aged 20 and over, selected through face to face interviews. Results More than half the women were exposed to domestic violence, which increases with factors like lower economic status, teenage and arranged marriages and a large number of children. According to the logistic regression model, arranged marriages, sexual problems and physical abuse during childhood lead to an increase in the occurrence of domestic violence, while this decreases as the partners age. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale scores were significantly lower in women subjected to domestic violence and this decrease became statistically significant as the level of abuse experienced during childhood increased.

Intimate Partner Violence in Interracial Couples: A Comparison to White and Ethnic Minority Monoracial Couples

Author: Fusco, Rachel A11 University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA raf45@pitt.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758123641?accountid=14925

Abstract: The number of interracial couples in the U.S. is growing, but they often receive little support. Although previous studies have explored the relationship between low social support and decreased relationship satisfaction in interracial couples, there are few studies on intimate partner violence (IPV) in these couples. To better understand IPV in interracial couples compared to monoracial couples, all police-reported IPV events across a municipality were examined. Odds ratios showed differences between interracial and ethnic minority monoracial couples. Interracial couples were more likely to have a history of prior IPV (OR = 2.60), engage in mutual assault (OR = 2.36), and result in perpetrator arrest (OR = 1.71) than ethnic minority monoracial couples. Victims of IPV in interracial couples were also more likely to be injured (OR = 1.37). There were no significant differences between the couples in terms of substance use or children present during the IPV event. Differences between IPV in interracial and White couples also emerged. Interracial couples were more likely to have children present (OR = 1.84), to have a prior report (OR = 1.98), to result in victim injury (OR = 1.73), and to result in perpetrator arrest than White couples (OR = 2.18). Interracial couples were more likely to engage in mutual assault than White couples (OR = 2.94). However, interracial couples were about 50% less likely than White couples to use drugs or alcohol before or during the IPV event. Research is needed to better understand the unique challenges and needs faced by interracial couples to help them sustain healthy partnerships.

An Interactional Perspective on the Relationship of Immigration to Intimate Partner Violence in a Representative Sample of Help-Seeking Women

Author: Bo Vatnar, Solveig Karin1; Bjorkly, Stal1 Oslo University Hospital, Ulleval, Norway

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758124490?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports a study of the possible impact of immigration on interactional aspects of intimate partner violence (IPV) among help-seeking women. Are there differences concerning (a) IPV categories, (b) IPV severity, frequency, duration, regularity, and predictability, (c) guilt and shame, (d) partners' ethnicity, and (e) children being exposed to interparental IPV, adjusted for sociodemographic variables? A representative sample of IPV help-seeking women (N = 157) recruited from family counseling, police, and shelters in Norway were interviewed. Multivariate analyses showed that immigrant women had lower income, were less likely to use alcohol and had increased likelihood of having an immigrant partner. No differences were found concerning IPV severity, frequency, guilt, shame, or victimization pertaining to different IPV categories. Immigrant women were better at predicting physical IPV but had an increased risk of physical injury related to sexual IPV. Children's risk of being exposed to interparental IPV increased if parents were immigrants. Psychosocial consequences of being an immigrant such as having a lower sociodemographic rank rather than IPV aspects constituted the main difference between ethnic Norwegian and immigrant help-seeking women.

Sex Differences in Intimate Partner Violence and the Use of Coercive Control as a Motivational Factor for Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Tanha, Marieh1; Beck, Connie J A; Figueredo, Aurelio Jose; Raghavan, Chitra1 University of Arizona, Tucson

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/758125383?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research argues that coercive control (CC) is a special case of intimate partner violence (IPV). The present study hypothesized that instead CC is the motivator for other types of IPV, with control of the victim as the goal. When CC fails, physical types of IPV are used. This hypothesized relationship was tested using a large matched sample of 762 divorcing couples participating in divorce mediation. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data with CC predicting two latent common factors of the overall level of victimization separately for men and women. Significant causal relationships between CC and the latent construct of victimization for both members of the couples were found. In addition, CC, psychological abuse, sexual assault/intimidation/coercion, threats of and severe physical violence were disproportionately reported as perpetrated by men against women whereas reports of physical abuse (e.g., pushing, shoving, scratching) were not.

Intimate Partner Violence and the Association With HIV Risk Behaviors Among Young Men in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania

Author: Maman, Suzanne1; Yamanis, Thespina; Kouyoumdjian, Fiona; Watt, Melissa; Mbwambo, Jessie1 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, smaman@unc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/811182420?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is growing evidence of the association between gender-based violence and HIV from the perspective and experiences of women. The purpose of this study is to examine these associations from the perspective of young men living in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. A community-based sample of 951 men were interviewed, of whom 360 had sex in the past 6 months and were included in these analyses. Almost a third of the men (29.2%) reported that they had been physically violent at least once with an intimate partner. Men who reported more lifetime sexual partners (OR = 8.75; 95% CI = 2.65, 28.92), experienced physical violence as a child at home (OR = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.09, 2.76), and were more educated (OR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.18, 3.11) were significantly more likely to report perpetrating violence. These associations persisted after adjusting for other variables. These data from the perspective of young men reinforce earlier findings from women that HIV risk and violence are occurring together in relationships of young adults. Interventions are needed to identify men at high risk for HIV and engage them in interventions that are designed to change norms and behaviors related to power and control with their sexual partners.

Europeanization in Making Policies against Domestic Violence in Central and Eastern Europe

Author: Krizsan, Andrea; Popa, Raluca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/764427836?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article looks at how Europe matters in the development of policies against domestic violence, a gender equality field outside the core European Union (EU) conditionality criteria. By analyzing the concrete workings and uses of Europe's domestic violence policy-making in five Central and Eastern European countries, it identifies three mechanisms of Europeanization in the field and shows how together they work to expand the reach of the EU to this policy realm. The findings point toward an understanding of Europeanization based on social learning and dynamic, interactive processes of constructing what membership in the EU means in terms of domestic violence policy processes.

Accountability in Teenage Dating Violence: A Comparative Examination of Adult Domestic Violence and Juvenile Justice Systems Policies

Author: Zosky, Diane L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/764415609?accountid=14925

Abstract: Unlike in the adult criminal justice system, where domestic violence policies hold perpetrators accountable for their violence, the juvenile justice system rarely addresses teenage dating violence. Although the adult criminal justice system has pursued policies toward intimate partner violence grounded on a 'zero tolerance' ideology, the juvenile justice system was originally founded on an ideology of 'child saving' to rehabilitate youths and divert them from the justice system. The implication of policy disparity between the adult criminal justice system and the juvenile justice system may be one contributing reason why teenage dating violence has received a different societal response than adult domestic violence. This article, a comparative examination of juvenile justice and domestic violence policies, reveals very different histories, philosophies, and trajectories of policy development. Teenage dating violence may be 'falling through the cracks' between two policy approaches. Perhaps the juvenile justice system could find a balanced approach to adopting the philosophy of zero tolerance or holding teenage perpetrators accountable for their choice to use violence, as the adult criminal justice system does, while at the same time maintaining the 'rehabilitative' philosophy of the original juvenile justice policies. Adapted from the source document.

Lost in Translation: Domestic Violence, "The Personal is Political," and the Criminal Justice System

Author: Bailey, Kimberly D11 Assistant Professor of Law, Chicago-Kent College of Law

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/856405202?accountid=14925

Abstract: Current criminal justice domestic violence policies have been severely criticized by some feminist scholars as undermining victim autonomy. This criticism is puzzling given the fact that these policies were drafted in response to the activism of feminists involved in the early battered women's movement and that autonomy, or the agency of women, was a key goal of this movement. This apparent paradox can be explained, however, by the fact that activists involved in the early battered women's movement and actors in the current criminal justice regime speak in two different "languages." Thus, victim autonomy is a concept that got lost in the translation of some of the goals of the early battered women's movement into criminal justice policy. While this Article acknowledges that victim autonomy is not the chief goal of the criminal justice system, it still urges proponents of current criminal justice policies to take seriously the fact that a high number of victims currently do not want to engage with the criminal justice system. This number is an important metric in analyzing the effectiveness of domestic violence policies. First, it underscores the fact that improvements need to be made in victims' interactions with the criminal justice system and in the criminal justice system's response to those victims who do ask for help. Second, it highlights the fact that the criminal justice system is a limited tool in addressing what is a social, political, and economic problem. For this reason, a criminal justice solution should be part of broader domestic violence policies that address the complexity of this issue. The economic disparities that women experience as a class and the intersectionality of race, class, sexuality, and gender are important aspects of a broader approach to the domestic violence problem.

Relational Aggression, Intimate Partner Violence, and Gender: An Exploratory Analysis

Author: Wright, Emily W1; Benson, Michael L1 University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/764416974?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explores the effects of romantic relational aggression on intimate partner violence. The concept of relational aggression denotes a type of nonphysical aggression that is specific to relationships and that has only recently been recognized in the psychological literature. Using responses to the Conflict Tactics Scale from adults participating in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, romantic relational aggression is examined with regard to male and female intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization. Results indicate that romantic relational aggression is a predictor of partner violence perpetration and victimization among both males and females. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Agency Directors' Perspectives on Services That Help Survivors

Author: Macy, Rebecca J1; Giattina, Mary C; Montijo, Natalie Johns; Ermentrout, Dania M1 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill rjmacy@email.unc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/822518540?accountid=14925

Abstract: Community-based domestic violence and sexual assault service providers need sound knowledge regarding services that work well to improve the lives of survivors. This exploratory, qualitative research aimed to help provide such knowledge by investigating domestic violence and sexual assault agency executive directors' ( n = 14) opinions regarding what services are most helpful for survivors. In-depth interviews with directors provided findings about (a) critical services for survivors; (b) essential service delivery practices; (c) ideal services that are challenging to deliver because of funding and other barriers; and (d) areas of service delivery practice uncertainty due to a lack of best practices.

Policing Intimate Partner Violence in Rural Areas and Small Towns: Policies, Practices, and Perceptions

Author: Schafer, Joseph A1; Giblin, Matthew J1 Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Carbondale, Illinois, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/818803880?accountid=14925

Abstract: The extant literature has given only limited consideration to the adoption of intimate partner violence policies and procedures on the part of police organizations, particularly in rural areas and small towns. Using survey data from police agencies in the southern regions of Illinois, this study found that although policies were nearly universal, specific elements varied. Agencies relied heavily on conferences and other departments in formulating their policies, making less use of recommendations from professional associations or the salient literature. The findings suggest variation in how intimate partner violence is perceived and policed in rural areas and small towns while highlighting some of the challenges agencies encounter in addressing this offense within their jurisdictions. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The situation of families undergoing separation in a context of co-occurrence of intimate partner violence (IPV) and child maltreatment raises certain issues related to child custody. The results presented in this paper were collected and analysed within the framework of a qualitative study aiming to identify the principal points of agreement and the main controversies amongst practitioners in several different types of organizations. Focus groups were held with a total of 43 practitioners from six different settings concerned with child custody in cases of co-occurrence of IPV and child maltreatment. Although they agreed on the importance of ensuring the safety of victims of violence, their views diverged on three points: (1) the importance of preserving the father-child relationship; (2) collaboration between voluntary organizations and semi-voluntary or legal agencies; and (3) consideration of cultural differences.

Who tells and what happens: disclosure and health service responses to screening for intimate partner violence

Author: Spangaro, J M1; Zwi, A B; Poulos, R G; Man, W.Y.N.1 School of Public Health and Community Medicine, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia j.spangaro@unsw.edu.au

Abstract: Routine screening of women for intimate partner violence (IPV) has been introduced in many health settings to improve identification and responsiveness to hidden abuse. This cross-sectional study aimed to understand more about how women use screening programmes to disclose and access information and services. It follows women screened in ten Australian health care settings, covering antenatal, drug and alcohol and mental health services. Two samples of women were surveyed between March 2007 and July 2008; those who reported abuse during screening 6 months previously (122) and those who did not report abuse at that time (241). Twenty-three per cent (27-120) of women who reported abuse on screening were revealing this for the first time to any other person. Of those who screened negative, 14% (34-240) had experienced recent or current abuse, but chose not to disclose this when screened. The main reasons for not telling were: not considering the abuse serious enough, fear of the offender finding out and not feeling comfortable with the health worker. Just over half of both the positive and negative screened groups received written information about IPV and 35% of the positive group accessed further services. The findings highlight the fact that much abuse remains hidden and that active efforts are required to make it possible for women to talk about their experiences and seek help. Screening programmes, particularly those with established protocols for asking and referral, offer opportunities for women to disclose abuse and receive further intervention.

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) has a detrimental effect on the wellbeing of victims and their children. Situational as well as individual factors shape victims' responses to the experiences of IPV in many ways. This study uses a quantitative approach to examine the factors that influence victims' decisions on whether and where to seek help. The role of (unborn) children has been examined together with other demographic and situational factors to reveal their influence on victims' help-seeking decisions. Two items were used to measure the role of children, including victims' pregnancy at the time of the abuse and children residing with the victim and witnessing the abuse. Relevant findings derived from the analysis of a sub-sample of women interviewed in the process of the International Violence Against Women Survey (IVAWS) 2002/03 are discussed throughout this paper with a specific focus on the role of children. While the presence of unborn children (i.e., pregnancy) had no effect on victims' help-seeking decisions, children witnessing the abuse emerged as the strongest predictor of general and more formalized help-seeking decisions.

Author: Kulwicki, Anahid; Aswad, Barbara; Carmona, Talita; Ballout, Suha

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/853216723?accountid=14925

Abstract: Ten focus group discussions were conducted with Arab American community leaders who had experience with victims of violence in the Arab American population and issues related to domestic violence. Community leaders were selected from an array of backgrounds, ranging from health and human service providers, legal and law enforcement service providers, religious and grass roots community organizations. Focus group discussions explored the role of personal resources, family, religion, culture and social support system in the utilization of domestic violence services by Arab immigrants experiencing domestic violence. In addition, issues related to personal, socio-cultural and institutional barriers in domestic violence service utilization were addressed along with identifying culturally competent policy strategies in reducing barriers for service utilization by Arab immigrants experiencing domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

Patterns and Perceptions of Intimate Partner Violence Committed by Returning Veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

Author: Finley, Erin P; Baker, Monty; Pugh, Mary Jo; Peterson, Alan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/852899323?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data from a recent mixed-methods study conducted among Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) raise important questions regarding the occurrence of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in this population. Three case studies illustrate two main findings. First, Veterans and family members participating in the study described three patterns of partner violence-violence committed in anger; dissociative violence; and parasomniac/hypnopompic violence-suggesting that distinct patterns of IPV may emerge in relation to PTSD symptoms. Second, participants' descriptions suggest that common ideas about PTSD and war-related suffering can play an important role in influencing how Veterans and their partners respond to episodes of partner violence. It is important for those providing care to PTSD-diagnosed Veterans and their partners to understand when and how partner violence may occur, and how both parties may perceive and respond to it, in order to aid in developing appropriate plans for coping and safety-seeking.

Intimate Partner Violence: Victims' Opinions About Going to Trial

Author: Hare, Sara C11 Department of Sociology, Indiana University Southeast, 4201 Grant Line Road, New Albany, IN, 47150, USA, schare@ius.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/852085286?accountid=14925

Abstract: Criminal justice officials assume that intimate partner violence victims oppose filing charges against their abusers. In a study of 94 respondents, reluctance actually occurred with the prospect of going to trial. While 70% supported filing charges, only 37% wanted a trial. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses help explain the reasons women gave for their opinions about trials. The strongest quantitative predictor was that as the level of the victim's injury sustained from the crime increased, their support for a trial increased. Gondolf and Fisher's (1988) survivor theory predicted factors that influenced victims' support or opposition to a trial in the quantitative section. The nested ecological model explained approximately half of the open-ended responses to those opposing trials while the goals of sentencing model articulated most victims' support for trials.

Computerized Aid Improves Safety Decision Process for Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Glass, Nancy1; Eden, Karen B; Bloom, Tina; Perrin, Nancy1 Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, Baltimore, MD, nglass1@son.jhmi.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887348419?accountid=14925

Abstract: A computerized safety decision aid was developed and tested with Spanish or English-speaking abused women in shelters or domestic violence (DV) support groups (n = 90). The decision aid provides feedback about risk for lethal violence, options for safety, assistance with setting priorities for safety, and a safety plan personalized to the user. Women reported that the decision aid was useful and provided much-needed privacy for making safety decisions. The majority (69%) reported severe to extreme danger in their relationship as scored by Danger Assessment (DA); only 60% reported having made a safety plan. After using the safety decision aid, the women felt more supported in their decision (p = .012) and had less total decisional conflict (p = .014). The study demonstrated that a computerized safety decision aid improved the safety planning process, as demonstrated by reduced decisional conflict after only one use in a sample of abused women.

Intimate Partner Violence During Pregnancy: A Pilot Intervention Program in Lima, Peru

Author: Cripe, Swee May1; Sanchez, Sixto E; Sanchez, Elena; Ayala Quintanilla, Beatriz; Hernandez Alarcon, Christian; Gelaye, Bizu; Williams, Michelle A1 University of Washington, Seattle

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/764419264?accountid=14925

Abstract: This pilot study examined the effectiveness of standard care and an empowerment intervention for abused pregnant women. Severe psychological abuse was most prevalent (42.2%) among this sample of women. Compared with women in the standard care group at the postintervention survey, women in the empowerment group were more likely to hide money (44.6% vs. 34.3%), establish a code with family or friends (19.6% vs. 16.2%), ask neighbors to call police if violence began (6.9% vs. 1.0%), had available bank account numbers (17.1% vs. 3.1%), had valuable jewelry (8.4% vs. 3.8%), and had available a hidden bag with extra clothing (9.0% vs. 3.1%). However, there was no statistically significant difference in health-related quality of life, adoption of safety behaviors, and use of community resources between women in the two groups. Simply asking pregnant women about abuse and offering referral could potentially interrupt and prevent further abuse. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Shelter and Service Receipt for Victims of Domestic Violence in Illinois

Author: Grossman, Susan F1; Lundy, Marta; George, Christine C; Crabtree-Nelson, Sonya1 Loyola University of Chicago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/764419817?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is little empirical research about the services victims of violence in shelters receive and when, yet such information would increase our understanding of their unmet service needs especially after they leave shelter. This article utilizes data from a randomly selected sample of individuals in shelter to examine their service trajectories. Results indicate that most individuals receive service while in shelter. Individual counseling is likely to continue after shelter, but group counseling, employment, and educational assistance tend to end once shelter is over. The policy and practice implications of these results are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Evaluation of a domestic violence intervention in the maternity and sexual health services of a UK hospital

Author: Bacchus, Loraine J1; Bewley, Susan; Vitolas, Carlos Torres; Aston, Gillian; Jordan, Peter; Murray, Susan F1 King's College London (at time of study), now Lecturer in Social Science, Department of Global Health and Development, Gender, Violence and Health Centre, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK

Abstract: This paper reports on an evaluation of a domestic violence intervention in the maternity and sexual health services of a UK hospital. The intervention encompassed guidelines, staff training, inclusion of routine enquiry for domestic violence with all patients, and referral of women disclosing violence to an on-site advocacy service. An 'assumption querying' approach was applied to evaluate the intervention. Programmatic assumptions were identified and tested using interviews with service providers and patients, review of patient records, and pre- and post-training questionnaires. Domestic violence training resulted in changes in health professionals' knowledge and practice in the short-term, but universal routine enquiry was not achieved even in a context of organisational support, guidelines, training and advocacy. Potential and actual harm occurred, including breaches of confidentiality and failure to document evidence, limiting women's ability to access civil and legal remedies. Advocacy support led to positive outcomes for many women, as long as support to maintain positive changes, whether women stayed with or left the violent partner, continued to be given. Maternity and sexual health services were found to be opportune points of intervention for domestic violence services that combine routine enquiry by clinicians, support after disclosure and attention to harm reduction.

Intimate partner violence during pregnancy: analysis of prevalence data from 19 countries

Author: Devries, Karen M1; Kishor, Sunita; Johnson, Holly; Stockl, Heidi; Bacchus, Loraine J; Garcia-Moreno, Claudia; Watts, Charlotte1 Lecturer, Gender, Violence and Health Centre, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London UK karen.devries@lshtm.ac.uk

Abstract: We aimed to describe the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy across 19 countries, and examine trends across age groups and UN regions. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (20 surveys from 15 countries) and the International Violence Against Women Surveys (4 surveys from 4 countries) carried out between 1998 and 2007. Our data suggest that intimate partner violence during a pregnancy is a common experience. The prevalence of IPV during pregnancy ranged from approximately 2.0% in Australia, Cambodia, Denmark and the Philippines to 13.5% in Uganda among ever-pregnant, ever-partnered women; half of the surveys estimated prevalence to be between 3.9 and 8.7%. Prevalence appeared to be higher in African and Latin American countries relative to the European and Asian countries surveyed. In most settings, prevalence was relatively constant in the younger age groups (age 15-35), and then appeared to decline very slightly after age 35. Intimate partner violence during pregnancy is more common than some maternal health conditions routinely screened for in antenatal care. Global initiatives to reduce maternal mortality and improve maternal health must devote increased attention to violence against women, particularly violence during pregnancy.

Exploring the associations between intimate partner violence and women's mental health: Evidence from a population-based study in Paraguay

Abstract: Using a nationally representative sample from the 2008 Paraguayan National Survey of Demography and Sexual and Reproductive Health, we examine the association between emotional, physical, and sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) and mental health among women aged 15-44 years who have ever been married or in a consensual union. The results from multivariate logistic regression models demonstrate that controlling for women's socioeconomic and marital status and history of childhood abuse and their male partners' unemployment and alcohol consumption, IPV is independently associated with an increased risk for common mental disorders (CMD) and suicidal ideation measured by the Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). IPV variables substantially improve the explanatory power of the models, particularly for suicidal ideation. Emotional abuse, regardless of when it occurred, is associated with the greatest increased risk for CMD whereas recent physical abuse is associated with the greatest increased risk for suicidal ideation. These findings suggest that efforts to identify women with mental health problems, particularly suicidal ideation, should include screening for the types and history of IPV victimization.

The characteristics of romantic relationships associated with teen dating violence

Author: Giordano, Peggy C1; Soto, Danielle A; Manning, Wendy D; Longmore, Monica A1 Department of Sociology, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH 43403, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/822521917?accountid=14925

Abstract: Studies of teen dating violence have focused heavily on family and peer influences, but little research has been conducted on the relationship contexts within which violence occurs. The present study explores specific features of adolescent romantic relationships associated with the perpetration of physical violence. Relying on personal interviews with a sample of 956 adolescents, results indicate that respondents who self-report violence perpetration are significantly more likely than their non-violent counterparts to report higher levels of other problematic relationship dynamics and behaviors such as jealousy, verbal conflict, and cheating. However, we find no significant differences in levels of love, intimate self-disclosure, or perceived partner caring, and violent relationships are, on average, characterized by longer duration, more frequent contact, sexual intimacy and higher scores on the provision and receipt of instrumental support. Finally, violence is associated with the perception of a relatively less favorable power balance, particularly among male respondents. These findings complicate traditional views of the dynamics within violent relationships, add to our understanding of risk factors, and may also shed light on why some adolescents remain in physically abusive relationships.

Racial Differences in Treatment Effect among Men in a Substance Abuse and Domestic Violence Program

Author: Scott, Melanie C1; Easton, Caroline J1 Yale University School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, Division of Substance Abuse, 1 Long Wharf Drive, Suite 7, New Haven, CT 06511, USA melanie.scott@yale.edu

Abstract: Background: It is unclear whether racial differences in treatment effect exist for individuals in substance abuse and domestic violence programs. Objectives: This study examined racial differences in treatment effect among substance dependent Caucasian and African-American male intimate partner violence (IPV) offenders court mandated to an integrated substance abuse and domestic violence treatment. Methods: From baseline to completion of treatment (week 12), 75 participants (39 Caucasian; 36 African-American) were assessed on demographics, substance use, legal characteristics, and use of violence (physical, verbal, and psychological). Results: African-American men served more months incarcerated in their life than Caucasian men. Both groups showed decreases in their use of physical violence and alcohol abuse over treatment. Caucasian men also showed a decrease in their use of verbal abuse. Conclusions and Scientific Significance: At treatment completion, both groups showed a reduction in physical abuse and alcohol abuse. Caucasian men showed a reduction in their use of verbal abuse, but African-American men did not. Substance dependent African-American male IPV offenders may benefit from interventions that thoroughly target communication skills in addition to issues of substance abuse and IPV to reduce use of verbal abuse and improve treatment outcomes among African American men. Adapted from the source document.

Who Are the Defendants in Domestic Violence Protection Order Cases

Author: Moracco, Kathryn E1; Andersen, Kathryn; Buchanan, Rebecca M; Espersen, Christina; Bowling, J Michael; Duffy, Courtney1 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill moracco@.unc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114413?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence protective orders (DVPOs) are the nation's most widely used intimate partner violence (IPV)-related legal intervention, and there is emerging evidence that DVPOs are effective. However, little is known about DVPO defendants. We examined a population-based sample of male DVPO defendants. Most had previous IPV-related offenses, mental health issues, and alcohol and drug-use histories. Court personnel should be aware of the severity of violence plaintiffs are likely experiencing, and the potential danger posed by defendants, and ensure that expedited and appropriate protection is awarded. Concurrent treatment for substance abuse and mental health may enhance the effectiveness of DVPOs. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Teen Magazines as Educational Texts on Dating Violence: The $2.99 Approach

Author: Hensman Kettrey, Heather1; Emery, Beth C1 Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN heather.h.kettrey@vanderbilt.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835112938?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study analyzed the portrayal of dating violence in teen magazines published in the United States. Such an investigation is important because previous research indicates that dating violence is a serious problem facing adolescents, teen magazines overemphasize the importance of romantic relationships, and teens who read this genre frequently or for education/advice are especially susceptible to its messages. Results indicated that although teen magazines do frame dating violence as a cultural problem, they are much more likely to utilize an individual frame that emphasizes the victim. Results were discussed as they apply to the responsibilities of professionals working with adolescents. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Resisting patriarchy within the State: Advocacy and family violence in Mexico

Author: Frias, Sonia M11 National Autonomous University of Mexico sfrias@correo.crim.unam.mx

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/852900235?accountid=14925

Abstract: Synopsis In the 10 years from 1996 to 2006, all but three states in the Mexican Federation passed laws dealing specifically with family violence. These laws are more symbolic than substantive for protecting women's rights given their unbridgeable duality of objectives: one the one hand affirming the sanctity of the family, while on the other protecting family members from the threat of family violence. The patriarchal attitudes that permeate the State are reflected in the terms and objectives of family violence legislation. Although the formal aim of the legislation has been to protect women from partner violence, the subordination of its contents and implementation to the goal of preserving families has worked against protecting the victims of partner violence. This article adopts a post-structuralist feminist perspective on the State, conceptualizing it not as a unified entity, but in terms of the collaborations and conflicts of the multiple agencies, agents, and agendas which constitute it. Using Giddens' structuration theory, I examine patterns of resistance both to the patriarchal social structure and to the State that is reproducing it. Some State employees-most of whom are women-who work in agencies that provide direct assistance to victims of family violence and design prevention programs work around the familist agenda by reinterpreting and ignoring regulations, investing their own time and resources to protect victims of partner violence. This article explores the agency of these individuals and examines how they strategically challenge or derail the reproduction of patriarchal structures by the State, working from within it.

Wife battering in South Korea: An ecological systems analysis

Author: Hong, Jun Sung1; Kim, Seon Mi; Yoshihama, Mieko; Byoun, Soo-Jung1 School of Social Work, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1010 W. Nevada Street, Urbana, IL 61801, USA jhong23@illinois.edu

Abstract: This article reviews the risk and protective factors for wife battering in South Korea based on the ecological systems theory. Although wife battering has been recognized as a major social problem in South Korea, understanding this phenomenon has been limited because the majority of empirical studies have examined individual characteristics without much consideration to broader environmental contexts for the victims and perpetrators. This review integrates the existing findings collectively on the factors associated with wife battering in South Korea within the context of micro-, meso-, exo-, macro-, and chrono-system levels. We then formulate implications on assessment and intervention strategies, which practitioners can utilize. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

Child welfare professionals' responses to domestic violence exposure among children

Author: LaLiberte, Traci1; Bills, Jessie; Shin, Narae; Edleson, Jeffrey L1 School of Social Work, University of Minnesota, MN, United States

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/764416770?accountid=14925

Abstract: Child welfare professionals are expected to promptly assess the current safety and future risks of children reported to them. Developing more accurate assessment methods has been a growing concern in child welfare. The presence of domestic violence and children's exposure to it are factors that have been included in many current risk assessment models used by child welfare professionals. An online survey of 152 child welfare professionals was conducted in twenty counties in one midwestern state. Professionals reported on the importance of (a) types of violence in a child's home and (b) the child's level of involvement in that violence; they also responded to how two hypothetical scenarios of child exposure to and involvement in violence would affect their decision making. The results provide insight into how child welfare professionals assess child exposure and involvement in domestic violence as a perceived risk and guidance on the training needs of these professionals.

Mandatory Reporting and Child Exposure to Domestic Violence: Issues Regarding the Therapeutic Alliance with Couples

Author: Tufford, Lea; Mishna, Faye; Black, Tara

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114558?accountid=14925

Abstract: Some child welfare legislation have recently expanded the definition of 'a child in need of protection' to include child exposure to intimate partner violence. Such legislation places clinicians in the challenging position of determining whether a situation falls under their duty to report. The current paper examines a case example in which there was child exposed to intimate partner violence, the clinician made a report to child welfare authorities and attempted to maintain the therapeutic alliance with the couple in treatment. The couple viewed contacting child welfare authorities as a crisis situation both in their marriage and in their family. Practice principles for clinicians are suggested. Adapted from the source document.

Psychoanalysis and Domestic Violence: Exploring the Application of Object Relations Theory in Social Work Field Placement

Author: McCluskey, Meghann J

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114337?accountid=14925

Abstract: Psychoanalytic theories are steadily falling out of favor within many American schools of social work. This lack of emphasis on psychodynamic perspectives deprives students of the rich developmental insight that can be of particular value in field placement settings like domestic violence shelters in which mother/child dyads are typically of clinical significance. However, existing examples object relations theory applied to contexts of domestic violence often fail to interrupt the replication of a hegemonic misogyny that has historically permeated domestic violence literature. In order to avoid unduly blaming women in contexts of domestic violence, clinical social work students interested in utilizing the theory of object relations in their work must employ an array of additional analyses that focus on issues such as race, financial status, and the psychological effects of trauma. Adapted from the source document.

Mandatory dispute resolution and the 2006 family law reforms: Use, outcomes, links to other pathways, and the impact of family violence

Author: Moloney, Lawrie1; Qu, Lixia; Hand, Kelly; De Maio, John; Kaspiew, Rae; Weston, Ruth; Gray, Matthew1 Australian Institute of Family Studies, Melbourne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862597789?accountid=14925

Abstract: Community-based mandatory family dispute resolution (more genetically known as family mediation) is a central plank of the 2006 changes to the Australian family law system. This paper provides an overview of the data on family dispute resolution from the Australian Institute of Family Studies' evaluation of the 2006 changes. It reports on usage rates of family dispute resolution as well as immediate and medium term outcomes, perceived pathways towards resolution and the impact of family violence on both outcomes and pathways. Though the story is a generally positive one, the data also suggest a need for family relationship sector practitioners and family lawyers to engage proactively in assisting those families who are experiencing significant violence and or significant levels of ongoing serious conflict. Adapted from the source document.

Risk Recognition and Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Witte, Tricia H1; Kendra, Rachel1 Birmingham-Southern College, AL twitte@bsc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/822518601?accountid=14925

Abstract: The objective of this study was to determine whether female victims of physical forms of intimate partner violence (IPV) displayed deficits in risk recognition, or the ability to detect danger, in physically violent dating encounters. A total of 182 women watched a video depicting a psychologically and physically aggressive encounter between heterosexual dating partners and made repeated judgments about the interaction. Results from this study provided evidence for the validation of this methodology and found that history of physical forms of IPV was associated with risk recognition ability, such that victims of IPV were less likely to recognize the danger involved in the video vignette compared to nonvictims. Results showed important implications for IPV prevention programs. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Intimate Partner Violence and Depression in a Population-Based Sample of Women: Can Social Support Help?

Author: Mburia-Mwalili, Adel1; Clements-Nolle, Kristen; Lee, William; Shadley, Meri; Yang, Wei1 School of Community Health Sciences, University of Nevada, Reno adelkaari@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/822518547?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data from the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in Nevada was analyzed to determine whether social support is independently associated with depression in a population-based sample of women with a history of intimate partner violence (IPV). More than a quarter (27%) of the women who were randomly chosen to participate in the survey reported lifetime IPV (n = 472). Twenty-four percent of abused women were categorized as currently depressed according to the eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Abused women who reported low social support, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 4.95, 95% CI (1.69-14.49), or moderate social support, AOR = 2.71, 95% CI (1.00-7.33), were more likely to be depressed than women who reported high levels of social support. Other independent risk factors for depression included younger age, AOR = 5.36, 95% CI (1.36-25.39); low education (less than high school), AOR = 12.55, 95% CI (2.78-56.72); fair or poor perceived health status, AOR = 3.72, 95% CI (1.39-9.87); being overweight or obese, AOR = 3.21, 95% CI (1.26-8.19); having experienced sexual IPV, AOR = 4.95, 95% CI (1.08-22.74); and having experienced both physical and sexual IPV, AOR = 4.54, 95% CI (2.07-9.99). There is an urgent need for routine screening for IPV and depression in clinic and community settings. Interventions that target younger women who experience IPV and aim to decrease depression in this vulnerable population are likely to be most effective if they promote social support, increase education opportunities, and support healthy weight loss behaviors.

Preliminary Construction of a Service Provider-Informed Domestic Violence Research Agenda

Author: Murray, Christine E1; Welch, Metoka L1 The University of North Carolina at Greensboro cemurray@uncg.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/822518550?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents the results of a statewide survey of domestic violence (DV) service providers that focused on the needs, background characteristics, and opinions of service providers related to research. The survey included an examination of service providers' motivation for working in the field, research background and training, and perceptions of research as well as the topics they believe are important for researchers to study, the resources they consult to learn about DV, and their suggestions to help researchers learn more about the nature of their work. The results are integrated into a preliminary agenda for future DV research that accounts for the needs and insight of service providers.

The Cycle Of Violence: Childhood Abuse History, Domestic Violence And Child Maltreatment Among Japanese Mothers

Author: Fujiwara, Takeo1; Okuyama, Makiko; Izumi, Mayuko1 Department of Social Medicine, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan, 157-8535 tfujiwara@nch.go.jp

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881467349?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of the present study was to illustrate the impact of childhood abuse history (CAH), experience of domestic violence (DV), and mental health problems on each type of child maltreatment (physical and psychological abuse and neglect) among mothers in Japan. A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted among a sample of mothers (N=304) and their children (N=498) staying in 83 Mother-Child Homes in Japan to assess the mothers' CAH, DV experiences, and current mental health problems, along with their maltreatment behaviors toward their children before moving into Mother-Child Homes. Regarding the mothers' child maltreatment before moving into Mother-Child Homes, CAH, DV, and mental health problems were significantly and independently associated with child physical and psychological abuse. Childhood physical/psychological abuse was also associated with child physical/psychological abuse, but that was not true for neglect. The present study thus confirmed intergenerational continuity of child physical and psychological abuse in Japan. Adapted from the source document.

Versions of violence: Zimbabwe's domestic violence law and symbolic politics of protection

Author: Christiansen, Lene Bull11 Department of Cultural Encounters, Institute of Culture and Identity, Roskilde University, Roskilde, Denmark

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/856404146?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article argues that political uses of violence and discursive representations of violence are part of a political discourse of legitimacy in Zimbabwean politics, and that this discourse relies on a gendered power matrix in which acts of violence are depicted either as legitimate protection or as illegitimate aggression or terror. The analysis is based on public debates about domestic violence legislation and media representations of political uses of violence in 2006 and 2007. However, this is viewed as part of a longer history of political violence, entailing a symbolic politics of protection and political legitimacy, in which the protection of the nation's women figures as metonymy for 'the people' in need of protection. Adapted from the source document.

Understanding Contexts of Family Violence in Rural, Farming Communities: Implications for Rural Women's Health

Author: Wendt, Sarah1; Hornosty, Jennie1 School Psychology/Social Work/Social Policy, U South Australia, Magill

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862596745?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on family violence in rural communities in Australia and Canada has shown that women's experience of family violence is shaped by social and cultural factors. Concern for economic security and inheritance for children, closeness and belonging, and values of family unity and traditional gender roles are factors in rural communities that form the social and cultural context in which health and wellbeing are embedded. The findings presented in this paper show that rural women often place their needs second to those of their partners, children and families and, as a result, may minimize their own health concerns, especially in situations that involve family violence. Rural health care workers need to recognize the way social and cultural contexts specifically impact on rural women in order to provide appropriate prevention and treatment programs to address rural women's health issues.

Domestic Violence, Poverty, and Social Services: Does Location Matter?

Author: Hetling, Andrea1; Zhang, Haiyan1 Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/818803931?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective. This study investigates whether or not domestic violence agencies are located in areas of need. Recent research indicates that community economic disadvantage is a risk factor for intimate partner violence, but related questions regarding the geographic location of social service agencies have not been investigated. Methods. analyze the relationship of agency location and police-reported domestic violence incidents and assaults using OLS regression and correcting for spatial autocorrelation. Results. The presence of an agency within a town has no relationship with the rates of domestic violence. However, regional patterns are evident. Conclusion. mismatched with need, but neither are programs located in towns with higher rates of incidents or assaults. Future research and planning efforts should consider the geographic location of agencies. Adapted from the source document.

Connecting Two Worlds: Training Social Workers to Deal with Domestic Violence against Women in the Ethiopian Community

Author: Ben-Porat, Anat11 Anat Ben-porat is a lecturer anatbp@biu.013.net.il

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/856405252?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence against women is a phenomenon that transcends religion, socio-economic status, nationality and culture. The literature indicates that the situation of women who immigrate from traditional societies to Western societies can be especially difficult, and that there is a need for culturally sensitive intervention among those groups of immigrants. The present article examines the causes of domestic violence against women among populations that have immigrated from traditional societies to Western societies, based on the specific case of Ethiopian immigrants to Israel. In that context, the article describes a programme for training Ethiopian social workers to deal with the problem among members of their community. Evaluations of the programme highlight its contribution to the Ethiopian immigrant community in general and to the participants in the programme in particular. In addition, the article addresses the principles of culturally sensitive intervention that can be applied towards prevention and treatment of domestic violence against women among groups that have immigrated from traditional societies to Western societies. Adapted from the source document.

The Perceptions of Judicial and Psychosocial Interveners of the Consequences of Dropped Charges in Domestic Violence Cases

Author: Gauthier, Sonia11 Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada sonia.gauthier@umontreal.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/853217390?accountid=14925

Abstract: Many domestic violence cases do not go to trial because the victim refuses to testify. This article presents a qualitative study exploring the dismissal of criminal charges in domestic violence cases. The 22 judicial and psychosocial professionals interviewed in Montreal, Canada, discussed various consequences of the legal decision to dismiss the charges on victims, perpetrators, justice system professionals, and society as a whole. Respondents clearly did not view the withdrawal of charges as a failure of the criminalization of domestic violence. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Living in the World of the Domestic Violence Perpetrator: Negotiating the Unreality of Coercive Control

Author: Williamson, Emma11 University of Bristol, England E.Williamson@bristol.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/852900089?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article considers how survivors of domestic violence negotiate the unreality of the world of the perpetrator to survive and the impact this has on their psychological well-being. Utilizing recent debates about coercive control and a reframing of domestic violence as a liberty crime, this article examines women's accounts of negotiating coercion and control. It presents data collected from oral history narrative interviews with women who have experienced domestic violence, as well as incidents of abuse recounted to the author while working with abused women, and reanalyzes those accounts in light of the theory of coercive control.

Abstract: HIV/AIDS and intimate partner violence (IPV) are growing public health concerns in South Africa. Knowledge about adult men's perpetration of IPV and links between HIV risk behaviours and IPV is limited. Respondent driven sampling was used to recruit men who have multiple concurrent female sexual partners. Forty-one percent of the 428 recruited men had perpetrated IPV. Inconsistent condom use was associated with physical IPV; experiencing a symptom of a sexually transmitted infection and engaging in transactional sex were associated with physical and sexual IPV; problem alcohol use was associated with physical, and any IPV, but not sexual IPV; having five or more partners was associated with sexual IPV; perceptions of partners' infidelity were associated with physical and any IPV. HIV risk reduction interventions among men, especially those with multiple female sex partners, should incorporate strategies to change the underlying construction of masculinity that combines the anti-social and risky behaviours of IPV perpetration, inconsistent condom use, transactional sex and heavy alcohol consumption.

Spousal Intimate Partner Violence is Associated with HIV and Other STIs Among Married Rwandan Women

Author: Dude, Annie M11 University of Chicago, 447 W. St. James Pl., Chicago, IL, 60614, USA, anniemd@uchicago.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/852273937?accountid=14925

Abstract: HIV is a health problem in Rwanda, where the adult HIV prevalence is 3.1% (WHO 2008 in Online database of HIV/AIDS epidemiological data, found at: http://www.who.int/globalatlas); the majority of those infected are women (UNAIDS 2008 in http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2008/rwanda_2008_country_progres s _report_en.pdf). Prior studies indicate that intimate partner violence is frequently associated with increased HIV risk in women, often because men who abuse their wives also exhibit riskier sexual behaviors (Silverman et al. in JAMA 300:703-710 2008. Population--based data from the 2005 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey indicate that women with few, if any, other sexual risk factors who have experienced sexual, physical, or emotional abuse within their marriages are 1.61-3.46 times as likely to test positive for HIV, and 2.14-4.11 times more likely to report another STI. These findings confirm prior clinical studies that indicate that intimate partner violence is a correlate of HIV/STIs in Rwanda. Further research is needed to determine whether Rwandan men that abuse their wives have higher baseline rates of HIV/STI infection.

Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration and Condom Use-Related Factors: Associations with Heterosexual Men's Consistent Condom Use

Author: Frye, Victoria1; Ompad, Danielle; Chan, Christina; Koblin, Beryl; Galea, Sandro; Vlahov, David1 Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development, New York University, New York, NY, USA, vf18@nyu.edu

Abstract: Intimate partner violence victimization has been linked to sexual HIV risk behavior among heterosexual women. The unique role of perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) in sexual risk behavior among men has not been studied as well. Based on interviews with 518 heterosexual men recruited via street-intercept between 2005 and 2007 in New York City, we assessed the relationship between perpetration of IPV against a main female partner and inconsistent condom use with that same partner, while controlling for condom use-related factors. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that men who perpetrated physical IPV were half as likely to report consistent condom use as compared with men who did not use violence, while controlling for sociodemographic, condom use-related and other factors. Physical IPV perpetration by heterosexual men makes an independent contribution to consistent condom use. Designing interventions for heterosexual men that simultaneously address both IPV and sexual risk behaviors is critical.

Social Work in the Emergency Department-Implementation of a Domestic and Family Violence Screening Program

Author: Power, Charmaine; Bahnisch, Laura; McCarthy, Debbie

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1542000929?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women who have experienced domestic and family violence use health services more frequently than women who have not. Early identification and intervention by the health system may reduce health problems associated with domestic and family violence and lead to savings for the health sector. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a new domestic and family violence screening program, which was based on an ecological model and introduced by a social work team in the Emergency Department of a major metropolitan hospital. The evaluation method included an audit of social work case files to assess the effect on referral rates and a survey of Emergency Department staff to obtain perceptions of the impact of the program on the staff and clients. In the 3-month period following the introduction of the program, the rate of referral to social work increased by 213%. Staff agreed that the Emergency Department is an appropriate place to ask about domestic and family violence, under certain conditions. Findings suggest that an ecological social work model provides an approach to screening for domestic and family violence that not only contributes to increased identification and supportive client interventions but may also contribute to more sustainable systemic change.

Abstract: Information is essential for combating violence against children and adolescents and reclaiming their rights. This study presents indicators for the evaluation of local government actions for reporting and recording cases of domestic violence and sexual exploitation of children and adolescents, based on participatory, consensus-based methodologies: the nominal group technique (NGT) and the Delphi method. The frame of reference was the set of Brazilian policies focusing on the issue of violence against children and adolescence. Experts from Brazil's five major regions participated in the study. The consensus produced two different analytical scenarios, with three and 20 indicators, respectively. Adapted from the source document.

Is there gender symmetry in intimate partner violence?

Author: Allen, Mary11 Lecturer, School of Applied Social Science, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914766623?accountid=14925

Abstract: 'Gender symmetry' is one of the most topical and controversial debates in the contemporary domestic violence literature. National survey data, particularly from the USA, has been utilized to support the concept of gender symmetry of violence between intimate partners. Both these statistics and the reliability of the methodologies used to obtain this data have been the focus of fierce criticism in the domestic violence literature. These debates have spread into the general media and now influence social workers' and students' understanding of violence between intimate partners. Recent work, however, has suggested helpful typologies for a better understanding of intimate partner violence (IPV), and research has explored their validity. A comprehensive understanding of the implications of these debates is important for safe social work interventions as assessments and interventions must be based on an accurate understanding of the aetiology, dynamics and consequences of violence between intimate partners. It is important that practitioners are aware of the background to and complexity of these debates and the ongoing work on typologies of violence, as such understanding will enhance assessments and thereby ensure more appropriate social work interventions. This paper traces the debates and outlines the new developments, which can enhance assessments and understanding of IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Two Generations at Risk: Child Welfare, Institutional Boundaries, and Family Violence in Grandparent Homes

Author: Day, Susan E1; Bazemore, Gordon1 Florida Atlantic University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037876372?accountid=14925

Abstract: Participation of extended family members, particularly custodial grandparents, has generally resulted in better outcomes for abused children and relief for an overburdened child welfare system. This research explores the risk of adolescent perpetrated violence in custodial grandparent households with data from the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice. Findings suggest that living arrangements with custodial grandparents have a significant and differential impact on rates of violent offending for chronic and serious offenders by race and gender. Adapted from the source document.

'Like waking up in a Franz Kafka novel': Service users' experiences of the child protection system when domestic violence and acrimonious separations are involved

Author: Buckley, Helen1; Whelan, Sadhbh; Carr, Nicola1 School of Social Work and Social Policy, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland hbuckley@tcd.ie

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862780451?accountid=14925

Abstract: The challenges that arise in respect of child abuse reports made in the context of domestic violence and/or acrimonious separation have been the subject of recent academic discussion. This paper adds a service user perspective to the debate and reports on the findings from a study conducted in the Republic of Ireland. In addition to the previously established evidence about such cases, it demonstrates the level of powerlessness and frustration experienced by families who found it difficult to have their needs heard or met. It also illustrates the very detrimental emotional impact on children and parents who frequently encountered indifference as well as insensitive and gendered responses from child protection staff. The findings indicate that mainstream statutory child protection services do not have the capacity to deal with these complex cases, and advocates the adoption of alternative approaches. Importantly, the study demonstrates the necessity to pay attention to the views of service users in developing an appropriate response. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

Abstract: A federal grant was awarded to provide the Love U2 healthy relationship curriculum to low-income, high-risk youth. This research sought to examine the relative effectiveness of a brief intervention with this curriculum compared to the much more intensive relationship education programs that have been previously provided to high-risk youth. Data were collected from 233 participants through measures of training and relationship outcomes pre- and post-training. Participants experienced high levels of training satisfaction, significant increases in relationship knowledge and self-efficacy related to conflict resolution. They also experienced a significant improvement in attitudes toward couple violence in the desired direction. Implications of these findings for promoting healthy relationships and reducing dating violence among high-risk youth are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

Functional (In)Capability Of The Elderly As A Risk Factor Of Exposure To Family Violence

Abstract: There is still controversy about the functional disability as a risk factor for violence against the elderly among researchers as evidenced by the numerous discussions in the literature. The aims of the research are to determine how elderly assess their functional capability, and to examine the relationship between functional ability of elderly people with violence experienced by older persons in the family. The results (N=968) indicates that older people show a relatively good functional capability, although older men have reported better functional capability than older women as well as the functional capability declines as age increase. Better functional capability has been reported by higher educated elderly. Correlation analysis has shown that elderly that reported poorer functional capability at the same time appear to have more experienced psychological violence. Accelerated longitudinal studies of risk and protection factors of certain forms of family violence are needed in order to understand specific causes of domestic violence, as well as the mechanisms that facilitate coping with elderly abuse.

Domestic violence and information communication technologies

Abstract: Physical violence against women is pervasive throughout the world and domestic violence has been a longstanding issue in feminist activism and research. Yet, these experiences are often not represented in technological research or design. In the move to consider HCI at the margins, in this paper, we ask: how have ICTs affected the experiences of domestic violence survivors? We interviewed female survivors living in a domestic violence shelter about their experiences with technology. Participants reported that they were harassed with mobile phones, experienced additional harassment (but also support) via social networking sites, and tried to resist using their knowledge of security and privacy.

10-Year Trends in Physical Dating Violence Victimization among U.S. Adolescent Males

Author: Howard, Donna E; Debnam, Katrina J; Wang, Min Qi; Gilchrist, Brian

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1567049181?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study provides 10-year trend data on the psychosocial correlates of physical dating violence victimization (PDV) among male participants (N = 7,949 in 2009) in the national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys from 1999-2009. Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were examined followed by multivariate logistic regression analyses, which included all significant independent variables from the univariate analyses. Adjusted OR and 95% CI assessed the significance of the relationships. PDV was significantly and consistently associated with feelings of sadness or hopelessness, repeated engagement in physical fighting, current and multiple sex partners, and lack of condom use. A less consistent but noteworthy pattern was found for PDV and gun carrying and cocaine use among adolescent males. PDV is an important public health issue for adolescent males, not just females. There appears to be a set of stable correlates of dating violence victimization among high school males in the United States. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to identify reasons associated with violent behaviors against the couple in the marital relationship of demobilized Colombian armed conflict. We evaluated 224 men residing in a distension military zone and psycho-social readjustment in the Colombian Caribbean Coast through a correlational design, using two questionnaires to detect violent behavior and the reasons relating thereto. The data were analyzed using Chi Square (x2) and stepwise linear regression modelling. The average domestic violence was 82.1% protruding verbal aggression, abandonment or neglect, threats and coercion. A history of previous sexual relations and maltreatment current thereto were associated with actual violence (p <0.05). Reasons such as feeling unwell, History of abuse in the origin family, Taxation, Rage, among others, were associated with forms of marital aggression. Adapted from the source document.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND OBESITY IN EGYPTIAN WOMEN

Author: Yount, Kathryn M1; Li, Li1 Departments of Global Health and Sociology, Emory University, Atlanta, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/849202321?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence and obesity are global public health problems. This study explores associations of domestic violence and obesity in 5015 ever-married, non-pregnant women aged 15-49 years who took part in the 2005 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). Women's mean body mass index (BMI) was 30.4 kg/m2, and 48% were obese. Thirty-seven per cent reported any prior psychological, physical or sexual domestic violence. Compared with their counterparts, the adjusted odds of being obese were marginally higher among women who reported any prior sexual (aOR=1.31), physical or sexual (aOR=1.18), or psychological, physical or sexual (aOR=1.17) domestic violence. Women who experienced severe or repeated domestic violence - as measured by reported exposure to three or more acts of physical (aOR=1.25), psychological or physical (aOR=1.18), physical or sexual (aOR=1.36), and psychological, physical or sexual (aOR=1.26) domestic violence - had higher adjusted odds of being obese. Marginally significant adjusted dose-response relationships remained between obesity and the number of specific acts of: (1) physical or sexual violence and (2) psychological, physical or sexual domestic violence. Obesity among women in poorer settings like Egypt may partly have its roots in gender subordination, as manifested in women's exposure to multiple acts of domestic violence.

Perceptions of Intimate Partner Violence, Age, and Self-Enhancement Bias

Author: Kane, Michael N1; Green, Diane; Jacobs, Robin J1 School of Social Work, Florida Atlantic University, 777 Glades Road-SO284, Boca Raton, FL 33431-0991, USA

Abstract: Educational programs in human service professions such as social work, criminal justice, psychology, and public administration stress the importance of recognizing domestic/intimate partner violence as well as elder abuse. Students' abilities to recognize domestic violence in older couples have not been well-investigated. In this study, three vignettes were developed (Pat and Lee at age 75, Pat and Lee at age 30, Imagine yourself with Lee at age 75) in which intimate partner violence was perpetrated by the character Lee. Twenty-five items followed each vignette. when the variables of educational standing (graduate/undergraduate), ethnicity, and academic major were controlled, there were significant differences between the vignettes in 14 of 25 items (General Linear Model, F=1.552, df=50, p = .012). More than three out four respondents for each vignette identified this as domestic violence and believed there was potential for serious harm. However, respondents were less likely to believe that a 75-year-old partner would know when to terminate a relationship in which there was intimate partner violence. Respondents who were asked to imagine themselves with Lee at 75 were likely to perceive Lee as more dangerous than respondents for the other vignettes. Implications are considered for educators. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The present study examined domestic violence and perceived social support in a clinical sample of Deaf and Hard of Hearing women. Forty-six adult Deaf and Hard of Hearing females receiving outpatient mental health services completed a modified version of the Conflict Tactics Scale and the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List. Results showed that nearly three-quarters (71.7%) of the sample related experiencing psychologically abusive behaviors, and over one-half (56.5%) reported a history of physical violence from a partner. In addition, participants reported experiences of domestic abuse directly related to their deafness. Level of perceived social support did not differ for participants with a history of domestic violence victimization compared to those with no such history. Findings underscore the need for increased awareness of Deaf and Hard of Hearing women as a population at high risk, and warranting further investigative attention, with regard to domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

Childhood Maltreatment, Intimate Partner Violence, Work Interference and Women's Employment

Author: Alexander, Pamela C

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896165704?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the long-term effects of childhood maltreatment, intimate partner violence (IPV) and work interference on women's employment in a sample of 135 housed or homeless women. Work interference (defined as a partner's interference with or restraint of a woman's working) was reported by 60% of women who had experienced IPV and was more common among non-Hispanic White women. Abuse history of any type was not predictive of women's employment or receiving job training, but child sexual abuse history and lifetime IPV were predictive of non-Hispanic White women's not looking for a job. Receiving job training was negatively correlated with women's current mental health. The study suggests different but overlapping pathways to the outcome of underemployment for racial/ethnic minority and majority women--namely, macro level factors and individual vulnerability factors, respectively. The need for trauma-informed services for unemployed and/or homeless women is highlighted. Adapted from the source document.

Academia Meets Community Agency: How to Foster Positive Collaboration in Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Work

Author: Davidson, M Meghan; Bowen, Nancy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896181437?accountid=14925

Abstract: Collaborative and supportive partnerships among academicians and community agency members represent one method of working successfully toward ending violence against women. Members of academia and service agencies are uniquely poised to collaborate with one another to foster both domestic violence and sexual assault research agendas as well as direct service to survivors. This paper provides suggestions and methods of how to create positive, collaborative relationships between academicians and service providers in the field of domestic violence (DV) and sexual assault (SA). Specifically, we will discuss the reasons for collaboration, useful steps in developing a partnership, issues of trust and time investment, research methods, and giving back. Adapted from the source document.

Legal Protection Against Domestic Violence in India: Scope and Limitations

Author: Ghosh, Biswajit; Choudhuri, Tanima

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896185809?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper deals with the scope and limits of legal measures to curb domestic violence against women in India. The Indian state has enacted several laws in the past to address the issue and recently a new comprehensive law is added to the list. The new law has become an alternative to many urban victims. Yet, a review of the performance of the old and new laws on domestic violence proves that legal measures to curb domestic violence have serious limitations. They could neither guarantee any reduction in the extent of such violence, nor could they expedite the justice delivery system in India. Much remains to be done to ensure gender justice in a patriarchal society. Discussion here is based on secondary data and supplemented by field data collected through qualitative research informed by feminist epistemology in the district of Burdwan, West Bengal. Adapted from the source document.

Clinical Challenges in Addressing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) with Pregnant and Parenting Adolescents

Author: Kulkarni, Shanti J1; Lewis, Carol M; Rhodes, Diane M1 Department of Social Work, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037876594?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been identified as a significant issue for pregnant and parenting adolescents. This study thematically analyzed data from focus groups with service providers (n=43) who work with pregnant and parenting adolescents to learn about barriers and strategies for addressing IPV. Service providers described four primary barriers to addressing IPV with their adolescent clients: adolescent clients' definitions of love, intergenerational relationship patterns, cultural norms about gender and violence, and developmental-contextual considerations. Service providers also indicated that they respond to adolescents' IPV related concerns by taking steps to identify IPV, building working relationships, and taking appropriate follow-up action. Results suggest that providers can benefit from increased training and skill development in working with IPV, as well as working in interdisciplinary, collaborative teams to increase effectiveness with challenging cases. Programs should consider integrating IPV prevention initiatives that target broader social norms. Future research should pilot and test the effectiveness of targeted IPV training and programmatic interventions with service providers who work with this population.

An Inside View of Police Officers' Experience with Domestic Violence

Author: Horwitz, Susan H1; Mitchell, Despina; LaRussa-Trott, Michelle; Santiago, Lizette; Pearson, Joan; Skiff, David M; Cerulli, Catherine1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037880872?accountid=14925

Abstract: Since the recognition of domestic violence (DV) in the late 1970s, police officers have been frontline providers. Despite their changing role as a result of the criminalization of DV, little is known about their experiences and responses to this public health issue from their unique perspective. Via focus groups, 22 police officers discussed their scope of practice and emotional reactions to DV calls. Participants reported frustration with the recurring nature of DV and with the larger systems' lack of accountability (e.g., courts, prosecution and community) that follow their initial interventions. Participants discussed the limitations of their role as protectors of public safety, attitudes that evolve over time and their beliefs as to contributing factors that perpetuate DV. Additionally, the officers recommend: more professional training, counseling, incident debriefing for officers including feedback on case disposition, better collaboration across professional groups, and evidence-based prosecution. Harsher penalties were also recommended. Adapted from the source document.

Trapped in a toxic relationship: comparing the views of women living with anorexia nervosa to those experiencing domestic violence

Author: Tierney, Stephanie1; Fox, John R E1 School of Nursing, Midwifery and Social Work, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010634914?accountid=14925

Abstract: People living with anorexia nervosa (AN) often report experiencing an inner voice that dominates their thinking and behaviour, and prevents them from progressing towards recovery. Little systematic investigation has been made of this entity. A qualitative study was conducted to explore people's experiences of living with an 'anorexic' voice. Data were collected in the form of written reflections produced by those with the condition. A thematic analysis, involving the two authors, was employed, and the computer programme Atlas-ti helped with data management. Poems, letters, and reflective narratives were provided by 21 females with AN. A key theme from these data was the toxic relationship participants described with their inner voice. This idea was explored by considering and comparing their writings with research investigating the perspectives of women enduring domestic violence; parallels between the two groups became clear during analysis. A novel way of considering AN outlined in the paper, as someone entrapped in a toxic relationship, has implications for practice and for further research. Adapted from the source document.

Evaluation of Cross-Disciplinary Training on the Co-Occurrence of Domestic Violence and Child Victimization: Overcoming Barriers to Collaboration

Author: Haas, Stephen M; Bauer-Leffler, Simon; Turley, Erica

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364700675?accountid=14925

Abstract: The co-occurrence of child abuse and domestic violence has gained increasing attention over the last several years. As a result, there have been a number of efforts around the country to cross-train domestic violence and child welfare workers. Many of these initiatives are based on recommendations derived from prior research which emphasizes the importance of cross training child welfare workers, domestic violence advocates, and others in order to enhance inter-agency collaborations and ultimately improve the handling of co-occurrence cases. Using a survey design and two samples of child protective service (CPS) workers were drawn, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of a statewide initiative to improve inter-agency collaboration through a series of cross-disciplinary trainings. Special attention is also given to the identification of barriers and their potential role in shaping collaboration. While this study did not find significant changes in CPS workers' knowledge, attitudes, or self-reported levels of collaboration overall as a result of the training, collaboration was found to be related to increased knowledge and positive attitudes toward collaboration post training. The findings further demonstrate that efforts to cross-train staff can change the way CPS workers view the presence of some barriers to collaboration. Implications for future research and strategies for enhancing inter-agency collaboration in co-occurrence cases are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Variables included organizational characteristics, agency protocols and practices, HIV/AIDS prevention programming, staffs' HIV/AIDS knowledge, and staffs' attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS prevention for women exposed to intimate partner violence. In this exploratory, descriptive study results indicated that most shelters had a significant awareness of how HIV/AIDS is transmitted, but few shelters offered testing (17%) or sexual safety planning (20%). Results also showed that eighty-one percent of respondents believe that HIV/AIDS educational prevention programs could be effective in protecting abused women from contracting HIV/AIDS. However, less than half (46%) of the respondents reported that they disseminate HIV/AIDS information to all women in the shelter. Adapted from the source document.

A Nationwide Survey of State-Mandated Evaluation Practices for Domestic Violence Agencies

Author: Riger, Stephanie1; Staggs, Susan L1 University of Illinois at Chicago, sriger@uic.edu sriger@uic.edu

Abstract: Many agencies serving survivors of domestic violence are required to evaluate their services. Three possible evaluation strategies include: a) process measurement, which typically involves a frequency count of agency activities, such as the number of counseling hours given; b) outcome evaluation, which measures the impact of agency activities on clients, such as increased understanding of the dynamics of abuse; or c) performance measurement, which assesses the extent to which agencies achieve their stated goals. Findings of a telephone survey of state funders of domestic violence agencies in the United States revealed that most states (67%) require only process measurement, while fewer than 10% require performance measurement. Most (69%) funders reported satisfaction with their evaluation strategy and emphasized the need for involvement of all stakeholders, especially grantees, in developing an evaluation.

Longitudinal Study on the Effects of Child Abuse and Children's Exposure to Domestic Violence, Parent-Child Attachments, and Antisocial Behavior in Adolescence

Author: Sousa, Cindy1; Herrenkohl, Todd I; Moylan, Carrie A; Tajima, Emiko A; Klika, J Bart; Herrenkohl, Roy C; Russo, M Jean1 University of Washington, Seattle, csousa@u.washington.edu csousa@u.washington.edu

Abstract: This study examined the unique and combined effects of child abuse and children's exposure to domestic violence on later attachment to parents and antisocial behavior during adolescence. Analyses also investigated whether the interaction of exposure and low attachment predicted youth outcomes. Findings suggest that, although youth dually exposed to abuse and domestic violence were less attached to parents in adolescence than those who were not exposed, for those who were abused only and those who were exposed only to domestic violence, the relationship between exposure types and youth outcomes did not differ by level of attachment to parents. However, stronger bonds of attachment to parents in adolescence did appear to predict a lower risk of antisocial behavior independent of exposure status. Preventing child abuse and children's exposure to domestic violence could lessen the risk of antisocial behavior during adolescence, as could strengthening parent-child attachments in adolescence. However, strengthening attachments between parents and children after exposure may not be sufficient to counter the negative impact of earlier violence trauma in children.

Intimate Partner Violence, Depression, and Alcohol Use Among a Sample of Foreign-Born Southeast Asian Women in an Urban Setting in the United States

Author: Wong, Frank Y1; DiGangi, Julia; Young, Darwin; Huang, Z Jennifer; Smith, Brian D; John, Don1 Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, 1518 Clifton Road N. E., Room 534, Atlanta, GA 30322 fwong3@emory.edu

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious global public health issue. At least one in three women worldwide has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused during her lifetime. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, more than three women in the United States die every day from physical abuse suffered at the hands of an intimate partner. IPV is defined as violence that occurs within the private sphere, generally between individuals who are related through intimacy, blood, or law. When perpetrated against women, IPV is generally understood to include physical, sexual, and psychological abuse by intimate male partners.

Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration by Court-Ordered Men: Distinctions and Intersections Among Physical Violence, Sexual Violence, Psychological Abuse, and Stalking

Author: Basile, Kathleen C1; Hall, Jeffrey E1 Division of Violence Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mailstop F64, 4770 Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA 30341 kbasile@cdc.gov

Abstract: This study assessed the construct validity of two different measurement models of male partners' perpetration of physical violence, sexual violence, psychological abuse, and stalking against intimate partners. Data were obtained from a sample of 340 men arrested for physical assault of a female spouse or partner and court ordered into batterer intervention programs. Men were surveyed before starting the intervention. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to compare the construct validity of a four-factor measurement model of intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration to a three-factor measurement model that combined psychological abuse with stalking; overlap in the perpetration of the various forms of IPV was also examined. CFA results supported the superiority of a four-factor measurement model. There were 96.8% of participants who reported perpetration of all four types of violence; most men perpetrated multiple types of violence. Future studies should determine whether there are distinct risk factors associated with each of the four types of IPV perpetration.

Universal Screening for Intimate Partner Violence: A Systematic Review

Author: Todahl, Jeff1; Walters, Elaine1 University of Oregon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902082926?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is known to be prevalent among therapy-seeking populations. Yet, despite a growing understanding of the dynamics of IPV and of the acceptability of screening, universal screening practices have not been systematically adopted in family therapy settings. A rapidly growing body of research data-almost entirely conducted in medical settings-has investigated attitudes and practices regarding universal screening for IPV. This article is a systematic review of the IPV universal screening research literature. The review summarizes literature related to IPV screening rates and practices, factors associated with provider screening practice, the role of training and institutional support on screening practice, impact of screening on disclosure rates, client beliefs and preferences for screening, and key safety considerations and screening competencies. Implications for family therapy and recommendations for further inquiry and screening model development are provided. Adapted from the source document.

Transforming the Spirit: Spirituality in the Treatment of the African American Male Perpetrator of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Hubbert, Paulette D11 Howard University, Washington, DC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902077518?accountid=14925

Abstract: When violence is internalized, it will manifest in various forms. Within the African American community, the African American male perpetrator's abusive behavior is one indicator of the internalized violence. African traditional practices of spirituality are a testament of their conceptualization and understanding of the intersection of mind, body, and spirit. The ways in which intimate partner violence (IPV) and spirituality intersect are critical. This article presents a conceptual framework informed by Intersectionality and Transpersonal theory to examine the intersections of IPV, gender, race, and spirituality for the African American male perpetrator in service delivery. Implications for further research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Moderating the Effects of Childhood Exposure to Intimate Partner Violence: The Roles of Parenting Characteristics and Adolescent Peer Support

Author: Tajima, Emiko A1; Herrenkohl, Todd I; Moylan, Carrie A; Derr, Amelia S1 University of Washington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896169831?accountid=14925

Abstract: We investigate parenting characteristics and adolescent peer support as potential moderators of the effects of childhood exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) on adolescent outcomes. Lehigh Longitudinal Study (N=416) data include parent and adolescent reports of childhood IPV exposure. Exposure to IPV predicted nearly all adverse outcomes examined; however, after accounting for co-occurring child abuse and early child behavior problems, IPV predicted only 1 outcome. Several moderator effects were identified. Parental "acceptance" of the child moderated the effects of IPV exposure on the likelihood of teenage pregnancy and running away from home. Both peer communication and peer trust moderated the relationship between exposure to IPV and depression and running from home. Peer communication also moderated the effects of IPV exposure on high school dropout. Interventions that influence parenting practices and strengthen peer support for youth exposed to IPV may increase protection and decrease risk of several tested outcomes.

The Reported Availability of U.S. Domestic Violence Services to Victims Who Vary by Age, Sexual Orientation, and Gender

Author: Hines, Denise A; Douglas, Emily M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862794047?accountid=14925

Abstract: Grassroots movements during the 1970s established several types of emergency services for battered women seeking to find refuge from or leave an abusive relationship. As time went by, the range of services offered by these agencies grew to include counseling, legal services, outreach, and other services, and battered women can now access over 2,000 domestic violence (DV) agencies throughout the United States for assistance. At the same time, these services have come under increasing scrutiny for their inability or unwillingness to provide their existing services to some populations of intimate partner violence (IPV) victims. In this article, we focus on DV agencies' ability to provide their services to various populations that have documented evidence of being underserved due to their age, gender, and/or sexual orientation. We present information on the percentage of agencies that report being able to provide victim-related services to each of these groups. We also consider various regional, state, and agency characteristics that may predict the availability of services to these underserved groups. Overall, agencies report that adolescents and men are the least likely groups to which they are able to provide their victim services. Results are discussed utilizing a human rights perspective that stresses that all IPV victims, regardless of age, sexual orientation, or gender, should have access to services provided by DV agencies.

Dating Violence Victimization and Alcohol Problems: An Examination of the Stress-Buffering Hypothesis for Perceived Support

Author: Shorey, Ryan C; Rhatigan, Deborah L; Fite, Paula J; Stuart, Gregory L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862792786?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that victims of dating violence consume alcohol at greater rates than their nonvictimized peers, placing them at risk for the negative consequences produced by alcohol use. Thus, research that examines factors that protect victims from consuming alcohol is needed. Toward this end, the present study sought to examine whether perceived support served as a stress-buffering (moderating) variable on the relationship between dating violence victimization and alcohol problems among a sample of currently dating college students (N = 440). Partial support was found for the stress-buffering effect of perceived support, but this varied depending on the type of victimization examined. Implications of these findings for victim interventions and dating violence prevention programming are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

The Gift of the Magi: Can Attachment, Altruism, and Hope be Mobilized in Treating Domestic Violence?

Author: Corvo, Kenneth; deLara, Ellen

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862793985?accountid=14925

Abstract: The debate concerning the Duluth model of domestic violence policy has centered on its assumptions concerning gender and its limitations as conceptual basis for practice. Here we both broaden and deepen that analysis by exploring the institutional context and political use of language that maintain the hegemony of that model. Particular attention is devoted to how the Duluth policy and practice framework produces a cynical and fatalistic view of both perpetrators and victims. Causal attribution to the vague construct 'patriarchy' both ignores empirically supported risk factors as well as strips clients of their uniqueness and autonomy. This is juxtaposed with the common factors theory of therapeutic interventions, which calls attention to how acknowledging client strengths and instilling hope can produce superior outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

New Directions for Domestic Violence Offender Treatment Standards: Colorado's Innovative Approach to Differentiated Treatment

Author: Gover, Angela R

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862794032?accountid=14925

Abstract: Colorado has recently adopted revised state standards for the treatment of domestic violence offenders who are court ordered to complete treatment. State standards across the county have been criticized in the past for not being empirically based. This article presents the empirically based principles of Colorado's revised Standards. The Standards are unique in their focus on differentiated treatment for offenders, and their use of the Domestic Violence Risk and Needs Assessment (DVRNA), an assessment tool developed in Colorado to identify offender risk and criminogenic needs. Offenders' overall scores on the DVRNA determine their dosage and intensity of treatment and containment. This article first discusses the history of Colorado's Standards, followed by a presentation of the new Standards. Most importantly, the empirical evidence providing the foundation for these Standards is presented. This article concludes with a discussion of Colorado's implementation plans for the revised Standards, limitations to the utility of Colorado's Standards, and directions for future research. Adapted from the source document.

Female Intimate Partner Violence Victims and Labor Force Participation

Author: VandeWeerd, Carla1; Coulter, Martha L; Mercado-Crespo, Melissa C1 University of South Florida, Department of Community and Family Health, Tampa, FL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/870998736?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although a non-gender-specific problem, intimate partner violence (IPV) disproportionately affects women on welfare, with an estimated prevalence two to three times larger than the national prevalence rates of IPV for all women. This article examines the effects of IPV on women leaving welfare for employment in a purposive sample of 411 women in Florida who participated or were actively participating in the 2000-2002 Work and Gain Economic Self-Sufficiency (WAGES) program. Data on socio demographic characteristics, their IPV experiences, and mediating factors (i.e., social support, employer support, physical and mental health, parenting stress, and employment success) were collected via quantitative telephone interviews. Logistic regression analyses found that employment success among welfare-recipient women who are currently in a relationship is best predicted by a short-term impact of having experienced IPV before the past 12 months (OR = 2.17). Linear regression analyses found that having suitable housing predicted lower parenting stress (F = 3.20, p less than .05) and better physical health (F = 4.30, p less than .05) and social support (F = 1.90, p less than .001) outcomes. In addition, suffering from IPV within the past 12 months predicted worse mental health (F = -7.74, p less than .001) and lower parenting stress outcomes (F = -3.99, p less than .001). This study contributes to understanding the complexity of mediating factors affecting IPVs impact on employment success of women leaving welfare. Adapted from the source document.

Perceptions of Domestic Violence in Heterosexual Relationships: Impact of Victim Gender and History of Response

Author: Terrance, Cheryl A1; Plumm, Karyn M; Thomas, Shea A1 University of North Dakota, Department of Psychology, Grand Forks, ND 58202-8380 cheryl.terrance2@und.nodak.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/870998748?accountid=14925

Abstract: Within the context of a heterosexual relationship, participants (n = 197) read a police interview involving a claim of domestic violence that varied the gender of the victim. Within gender conditions, the victim's previous history of response to the violence, and on the evening in question, was portrayed as either passive or active (i.e., fought back). Results support the notion of a prototypical domestic violence victim that has emerged within a gendered framework. Overall, the female victim was perceived in a more sympathetic light than the male victim was. Interaction effects showed that men, but not women, rated the male victim as more responsible for the assault than the female victim. Participant gender effects indicated that women rated the victim and their claim of victimization more favorably than men did. Implications within the courtroom are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Comparison of Impulsive and Premeditated Female Perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Lake, Sarah L1; Stanford, Matthew S1 Baylor University, Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, One Bear Place, #97334, Waco, TX 76798-7334

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902081200?accountid=14925

Abstract: A bimodal classification of aggression has been shown to be useful among male perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV; Stanford, Houston, & Baldridge, 2008). To extend this research, this study attempts to replicate this result in a female population. The Impulsive/Premeditated Aggression Scale (IPAS) was used to classify (N = 87) females who were convicted of domestic violence and court ordered into an intervention program as being predominately impulsive-aggressive (IA) or predominately premeditated-aggressive (PM). The results of this study demonstrate that female IPV perpetrators (both IA and PM) tend to be similar to male IA batterers, with low psychopathic traits and higher levels of psychopathology. Implications and future directions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This study examined gender differences in impacts of dating violence (specifically minor and severe physical injury, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], problems with alcohol, self-esteem, and relationship satisfaction) using a sample of 305 male and 363 female undergraduate students. Multiple linear regression models were used to test for the effects of dating violence victimization on the eight outcome variables while controlling for the effects of perpetration and psychological victimization. Results indicated that physical violence victimization did not impact problems with alcohol, self-esteem, or relationship satisfaction for either males or females. However, being a victim of minor violence significantly increased the levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD and being a victim of severe violence significantly increased minor and severe injury. Different gender effects were seen in anxiety and PTSD scores where male victims scored higher than male nonvictims, but female victims did not differ significantly from female nonvictims and in minor and severe injury where both male and female victims scored higher than nonvictims, but the difference between the two groups was greater for men on the severe injury subscale and greater for women on the minor injury subscale. Overall, results of our analyses indicate that both male and female victims of dating violence experience physical and mental health consequences and, on the whole, do not support previous findings that would suggest that female victims suffer a greater impact than male victims do.

Differences Between Perpetrators of Bidirectional and Unidirectional Physical Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Charles, Dyanna1; Whitaker, Daniel J; Le, Brenda; Swahn, Monica; DiClemente, Ralph J1 Institute of Public Health, P.O. Box 3995, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30302-3995

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious public health issue causing significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden to its victims and society. Prior research suggests that bidirectional or reciprocal IPV perpetration (cases in which both partners perpetrate IPV toward the other) is common and more serious than unidirectional IPV. However, little is known about the characteristics of individuals and couples who engage in bidirectional versus unidirectional IPV. Using Waves I and III of Add Health, a large, nationally representative sample of young adults, we compared characteristics of perpetrators of bidirectional and unidirectional physical IPV perpetration to each other and to nonperpetrators across a range of variables. Among study participants, 18.3% reported IPV perpetration in their most recent important relationship, and 65.4% of that was bidirectional, meaning the participant also reported that their partner perpetrated against them. Bivariate analyses showed that both types of perpetrators -- bidirectional and unidirectional -- differed significantly from nonperpetrators on nearly all variables examined. In multivariate analyses, seven variables were related to bidirectional versus unidirectional IPV perpetration at the .05 level: sex, violent delinquency, substance use, poor grades, depression, having had sex in the relationship, and cohabitation status. There were few sex differences in variables related to reciprocity; only three variables showed differential correlation with reciprocity (early sexual initiation, depression, partner age difference); and only one (depression) remained significant in multivariate models, indicating that the correlates of IPV reciprocity were largely similar for men and women. Adapted from the source document.

Expected Outcomes of Dating Violence: Perspectives From Female Perpetrators

Author: Sherrill, Andrew M1; Wyngarden, Nicole; Bell, Kathryn M1 Department of Psychology, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL 60115

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914767589?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite recent growth in female dating violence perpetration research, little is known about college women's expected outcomes of physical aggression perpetration in a dating relationship. Furthermore, no known studies have investigated women's expected outcomes of dating aggression within the context of a specific dating violence episode or examined the extent to which expected outcomes are consistent or inconsistent with actual dating aggression outcomes. The purpose of this study is to qualitatively investigate the range of dating violence expected and actual outcomes reported by college women with a recent history of physical dating violence perpetration. Twenty female undergraduate students completed individual contextually based interviews regarding their expected and actual outcomes of physical dating aggression perpetration surrounding their most recent dating violence episode. Interviews were analyzed using a theoretical thematic analysis approach. Nine main expected outcome themes reflecting a range of both rewarding and punitive consequences were identified, including no expectations -- just reacted, nothing would happen, escape or end aversive interaction with partner, modify partner attention, increase partner compliance, increase physical space. facilitate communication, alter emotional state, and partner retaliation. Interestingly, use of physical aggression to stop or blunt partner's physical aggression was not an expected outcome reported by any of the participants. Findings indicate that participants' expected outcomes were often consistent with the actual outcomes of dating aggression. However, a subset of participants also reported actual outcomes inconsistent with expectations and many reported additional unanticipated outcomes. Study limitations, clinical implications, and directions for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

The Reported Availability of U.S. Domestic Violence Services to Victims Who Vary by Immigration Status, Primary Language, and Disability

Author: Douglas, Emily M1; Hines, Denise A1 School of Social Work, 95 Burrill Avenue, Bridgewater State University, Bridgewater, MA 02325

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914767594?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article is the second of a two-part series that investigates the reported availability of domestic violence (DV) services for individuals in traditionally underserved populations. This specific article focuses on immigrants, individuals with limited English language skills, and individuals with disabilities. The sample consisted of 213 DV agency directors from across the nation who responded about the availability of services in their agencies in several different domains: housing, legal, counseling/mental health, education, transportation, and outreach services. The results indicate a fairly high level of services across the board, especially with regard to serving immigrants, individuals with limited English language skills, and individuals with disabilities. Services for individuals with hearing impairments and undocumented immigrants were less available. Recommendations for practice and future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Women's perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV) has been an extremely controversial topic. In this article, the author discusses 10 reasons why it is critically important to study women's use of IPV. The prevalence and motivation of women's use of IPV are discussed, as well as the psychopathology typically found in clinical samples of female IPV perpetrators. Consequences of women's IPV for victims, for romantic relationships, for witnessing children, and for the female perpetrators themselves are reviewed. Evidence points to the importance of research on this topic and the urgent need for effective prevention and intervention programs for women's perpetration of IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Healing Circles as an Alternative to Batterer Intervention Programs for Addressing Domestic Violence Among Orthodox Jews

Author: Zakheim, Suzanne Faye

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914767608?accountid=14925

Abstract: Orthodox Jewish (OJ) families living with violence have concerns that are specific to their culture and tradition. This article, based on a 2009 study at New York University (S. F. Zakheim, 2009), explores the possibility that mainstream interventions developed to address domestic violence lack features that make them optimal for use among OJ families. One often used treatment, the Batterer Intervention Program (BIP), is predicated on the belief that resocializing the male abuser will eliminate the problem of violence in a domestic setting. The BIP method of treatment dictates that, once violence has been reported, a chain of legal and societal events must be set into motion. This treatment does not involve the victim and may not even take into account his or her own expressed desires. This article considers that, within the OJ community, it may be necessary to view domestic violence from a different perspective. To this end, it compares two forms of intervention carried out with OJ families: the BIP and an innovative restorative justice approach called healing circles (HCs). The restorative justice theory, on which HCs are predicated, permits the victim (not the legal authorities) to define what restitution he or she receives from the perpetrator. Unlike the BIP, which targets the behaviors of the abuser only, HCs work with the entire family -- and the broader community -- even taking into account community rituals and individual characteristics. As a treatment method sensitive to cultural intricacies, the HC proved to be more effective than BIPs in dealing with domestic violence in the OJ community. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/856407687?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: To preliminarily evaluate telephone-delivered motivational enhancement therapy (MET) in motivating unadjudicated and nontreatment seeking intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrators, who also use substances, to self-refer into treatment. Method: 124 adult men were recruited via a multimedia marketing campaign and were randomly assigned to the intervention (MET) or comparison group following a baseline assessment Participants in the MET condition received a personalized feedback report on their IPV and substance-use behaviors, consequences, and social norms beliefs. Results: Results supported the likely effectiveness of MET in short-term reduction of IPV behavior, increasing motivation for treatment seeking, and changing perceived norms for IPV and substance abuse (SA). Conclusions: Applications for brief MET interventions to facilitate voluntary treatment entry among substance-using IPV perpetrators are discussed.

Women's Conformity as Resistance to Intimate Partner Violence in Assiut, Egypt

Author: Yount, Kathryn M11 Rollins School of Public Health, 1518 Clifton Road NE, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA, kyount@emory.edu

Abstract: This paper explores, in Assiut, Egypt, how women respond to IPV and how their social relations sustain or prevent it. Nineteen qualitative interviews with married women were coded in MaxQDA, revealing a pattern of strategic conformity. Most women blamed the wife for spousal aggression and recommended modifying her behavior to end it. Talking with female kin, who often advised tolerance, was the next most common reaction. When such tactics failed, a woman might ask male kin to intervene. Seeking the police or courts was considered shameful and might jeopardize a woman's marriage. Women enacted "the good woman" to preserve self-worth and oblige husbands or male kin to return protection. Ostensibly, these strategies mitigated IPV but maintained its underlying patriarchal structures.

Abstract: This study evaluated a community-based treatment program in Sweden for mothers subjected to intimate partner violence. Results based on group means indicated that the mothers showed significantly reduced trauma and psychological symptoms and improved sense of coherence after participating in the program. Surprisingly, no improvement regarding perceived parental locus of control was found. Furthermore, as a complement to group statistics a reliable change index was used, which resulted in more modest results regarding the effectiveness of the treatment.

The Language of Healing: Women's Voices in Healing and Recovering From Domestic Violence

Author: Allen, Karen Neuman1; Wozniak, Danielle F1 Social Work Program, Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902080576?accountid=14925

Abstract: Little is known about the course of recovery or healing from intimate partner violence. Shelter-based interventions are limited and frequently end before traumatized women can adequately reconstruct social and personal identity. Based on the belief that healing from relationship violence is a social, spiritual, cultural, and psychological process, we designed a group treatment approach that discouraged repetitive disclosure about the history of abuse and that used holistic, integrative, and alternative healing approaches such as prayer, meditation, yoga, creative visualization, and art therapy. Structured interviews and focus groups were used to engage the women in articulating a conceptualization of healing from domestic violence. The Post-traumatic Checklist was used as a pre and posttest measure to assess the group's effectiveness. Positive quantitative and qualitative results were obtained and are presented. Implications for further research are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and HIV Among Drug-Involved Women: Contexts Linking These Two Epidemics-Challenges and Implications for Prevention and Treatment

Author: El-Bassel, Nabila1; Gilbert, Louisa; Witte, Susan; Wu, Elwin; Chang, Mingway1 Social Intervention Group, Columbia University School of Social Work, 1255 Amsterdam Avenue, New York, NY 10027

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/856405478?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV are two serious overlapping public health epidemics that disproportionately affect drug-involved women. This article reviews research that has identified a number of contexts that may explain the links between IPV and HIV transmission risks. These contexts include sexual coercion, fear of violence, negotiation of condom use, extradyadic relationships, disclosure of sexually transmitted infections or HIV seropositivity to intimate partners, drug involvement of women and their male partners, low social status of drug-involved women, relationship dependencies, and sex ratio imbalances. The article focuses on how the bidirectional relationship between IPV and HIV risks may be mediated by a history of childhood sexual abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder. Also addressed are the challenges that substance user treatment programs face in dealing with female clients who experience IPV and the implications for HIV prevention. Adapted from the source document.

Assault on Self: Intimate Partner Abuse and the Contestation of Identity

Author: Allen-Collinson, Jacquelyn11 Department of Education, University of Bath J.Allen-Collinson@bath.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964186988?accountid=14925

Abstract: The complexities of intimate partner abuse and violence have been studied from a range of theoretical, conceptual, and methodological perspectives. It is argued here that symbolic interactionist analyses offer specific and powerful insights into this particular interactional domain. This article is based on data generated by a topical life-history case study of a well-educated, middle-class, middle-aged man, whose wife subjected him to sustained unilateral violence and abuse, resulting in deleterious consequences for his health and well-being. Data were gathered via a series of in-depth interviews and a personal diary. The analysis draws on Goffman's conceptualization of "possessional territory" as one of the "territories of the self," in order to examine the role of possessions in the interactional routines of intimate partner abuse. Adapted from the source document.

The impact of fatherhood on treatment response for men with co-occurring alcohol dependence and intimate partner violence

Author: Stover, Carla Smith1; McMahon, Thomas J; Easton, Caroline1 National Center for Children Exposed to Violence, Yale University Child Study Center, 230 South Frontage Road, New Haven, CT 06520, USA carla.stover@yale.edu

Abstract: Objective: The role of fathers in the lives of children has gained increasing attention over the last several decades, however, studies that specifically examine the parenting role among men who are alcohol dependent and have co-occurring intimate partner violence (IPV) have been limited. This brief report is intended to highlight the need to develop and focus interventions for men with co-occurring substance abuse and IPV with an emphasis on their roles as fathers. Method: Sixty-nine men who participated in a randomized comparison study of a coordinated substance abuse and domestic violence treatment program (SADV) and Twelve Step Facilitation (TSF) provided information about whether they were fathers. Analysis of covariance was used to assess the impact of fatherhood on the outcomes of intimate partner violence and alcohol use during the 12 weeks of treatment. Results: There was a significant interaction between type of treatment (SADV vs. TSF) and fatherhood. SADV resulted in significantly less IPV and use of alcohol over the 12 weeks of treatment than TSF for men without children. There were no significant differences between SADV and TSF for men who were fathers. Conclusion and Scientific Significance: Results indicate a need to further explore the role of fatherhood for men with co-occurring substance abuse and IPV and development of specialized treatments that may improve treatment outcomes for fathers. Adapted from the source document.

Disabled Women, Domestic Violence and Social Care: The Risk of Isolation, Vulnerability and Neglect

Author: Hague, Gill1; Thiara, Ravi; Mullender, Audrey1 Professor of Violence Against Women Studies in the School for Policy Studies and Co-Director of the Violence Against Women Research Group at the University of Bristol, England

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862780784?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper reports on the first ever national study in the UK of the needs of disabled women experiencing domestic violence and of the services available to meet these needs. The study found that, in general, support services frequently overlook or respond inappropriately to disabled women in this situation. The overall findings of the research were very wide-ranging, as were the resultant recommendations for statutory agencies, disability organisations, domestic violence services and wider strategic and commissioning frameworks. In this paper, the general findings are discussed briefly, followed by a discussion of abuse by paid carers/personal assistants in the context of the personalisation agenda, with a focus on issues for adult care services. Adapted from the source document.

Readiness to Change: Mother-Child Relationship and Domestic Violence Intervention

Author: Humphreys, Cathy1; Thiara, Ravi K; Skamballis, Agnes1 Alfred Felton Chair of Child and Family Welfare at University of Melbourne, Australia Cathy.humphreys@unimelb.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862780760?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper argues that 'readiness to change' is not a concept which should only be used to understand an individual's motivation to change. In the complex field of domestic violence intervention, organisations and workers are as important in the change process as the women and children with whom they work. An action research project was undertaken to explore changes to practice which needed to occur if a model of individualised intervention for women and children shifted to a focus on strengthening their relationship in the aftermath of domestic violence. 'The Talking to My Mum' project developed activities to support the change process and found that organisations and workers needed to be 'ready' and motivated to embrace the change to the work focus if the entrenched divisions between services for children and services for women in domestic violence intervention were to be overcome. Creative processes were needed to support women and children if they were to feel safe and supported in strengthening their relationship in the aftermath of violence.

The Contribution of Training and Supervision to Perceived Role Competence, Secondary Traumatization, and Burnout Among Domestic Violence Therapists

Author: Ben-Porat, Anat1; Itzhaky, Haya1 Bar-Ilan, Ramat-Gan, Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896166119?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines differences between domestic violence therapists in Israel who had received specific training in the field and those who had not, with regard to the following variables: sense of role competence, secondary traumatization, and burnout. In addition, the study examines the correlation between the therapists' satisfaction with supervision on the one hand, and their sense of role competence, secondary traumatization, and burnout on the other. Participants included 143 social workers employed at centers for prevention of domestic violence and at battered women's shelters in Israel. The findings revealed no significant differences between the two groups of therapists in levels of burnout and secondary traumatization. However, significant differences between the two groups were found with regard to their sense of role competence in task knowledge/problem solving. Regarding satisfaction with supervision, no significant correlation was found with secondary traumatization and burnout. At the same time, a significant positive correlation was found between satisfaction with supervision and two components of role competence: task knowledge/problem solving and general competence.

"Being in a Room with Like-Minded Men": An Exploratory Study of Men's Participation in a Bystander Intervention Program to Prevent Intimate Partner Violence

Abstract: The bystander approach suggests that individuals can intervene to interrupt situations leading to violence and has previously been used in sexual assault prevention. This article applies the bystander approach to interpersonal violence. An exploratory study was conducted to assess a workshop designed to prevent intimate partner violence that utilized the bystander approach with male participants. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to measure male participants' attitudes regarding bystander intervention behaviors and attitudes after participating in a workshop designed to encourage bystander intervention behaviors. A total of 41 men completed posttest surveys, and eight participated in face-to-face interviews. Important findings indicate that many participants expressed anxiety in social situations that inhibited bystander behavior and that many men desired more opportunities to talk in open forums such as the workshops with other like-minded men. Adapted from the source document.

Factors Related to the Completion of Domestic Violence Offender Treatment: The Colorado Experience

Author: Gover, Angela R1; Jennings, Wesley G; Davis, Cheryl; Tomsich, Elizabeth A; Tewksbury, Richard1 School of Public Affairs, University of Colorado at Denver, Denver, Colorado, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1030869227?accountid=14925

Abstract: The majority of prior literature examining factors related to domestic violence treatment completion has used samples of male offenders only. This study identifies specific offender demographics, risk/protective factors, and treatment-relevant variables that are related to program treatment completion among a sample of 4,095 male and female domestic violence offenders who were court ordered to attend treatment in Colorado. Findings indicate that most of the significant predictors for female offenders were similar to those of male offenders. There were, however, additional predictors for male offenders that did not impact treatment completion for female offenders. Study limitations and implications for policy and practice are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Breaking from the Past: The Challenge of Documenting Intimate Partner Violence in Southeastern Europe

Author: Sudderth, Lori K

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964191885?accountid=14925

Abstract: Without systematically collected data on violence against women, it is difficult to know how often the violence occurs and what populations are most in need of services. These efforts are especially needed in southeastern Europe, where there have been significant legislative changes in the last ten years but few mechanisms for monitoring progress or enforcement of policies. Efforts to establish systematic data collection are hampered by a lack of infrastructure to support such projects, cultural emphasis on male authority, and long-standing conflicts in the region. Recommendations for further research in the region are included. Adapted from the source document.

"How Would That Help Our Work?": The Intersection of Domestic Violence and Human Rights in the United States

Author: Morgaine, Karen11 California State University, Northridge karen.morgaine@csun.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/856405032?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study explores whether individuals working within the domestic violence (DV) field in the United States have utilized a human rights framework and identifies potential benefits of this framework. Using the critique and experiences of women of color as a focal point, data were gathered through interviews with key individuals working with national and regional DV and human rights organizations. This article focuses on challenges within the mainstream DV movement and how a human rights approach could potentially ameliorate some of these concerns by supporting a more holistic approach to DV and increasing coalition building and community engagement.

Lesbian/Bisexual Mothers and Intimate Partner Violence: Help Seeking in the Context of Social and Legal Vulnerability

Author: Hardesty, Jennifer L1; Oswald, Ramona F; Khaw, Lyndal; Fonseca, Carol1 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, hardesty@illinois.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/852215825?accountid=14925

Abstract: Mothers in same-sex relationships face unique challenges when help seeking for intimate partner violence (IPV). Formal helping systems often invalidate their family relationships, leaving them vulnerable and distrustful when help seeking. To better understand their experiences, the authors interviewed 24 lesbian/bisexual mothers who were either in or had left abusive same-sex relationships. Increasing severity of violence, effects of violence on children and families, and "being tired" influenced their definitions of the situation. Decisions to seek formal help appeared to be influenced by their support from informal networks and perceived stigma related to the intersection of IPV and being lesbian or bisexual.

Variations in Women's Help Seeking in Response to Intimate Partner Violence: Findings From a Canadian Population-Based Study

Author: Barrett, Betty Jo1; Pierre, Melissa St1 University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada, bbarrett@uwindsor.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/852214045?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the role of sociodemographic factors and v iolence characteristics in influencing women's use of informal and formal supports in response to intimate partner v iolence (IPV) in a national surv ey of Canadian households. A subset of female respondents in the 1999 Canadian General Social Surv ey who experienced at least one incident of physical or sexual IPV by a male current or former intimate partner was used for this analysis. Findings suggest that although there are significant sociodemographic v ariations in women's help seeking, the largest independent predictor of women's use of supports is fear that one's life is in danger.

Risk Assessment With Victims of Intimate Partner Violence: Investigating the Gap Between Research and Practice

Author: Bennett Cattaneo, Lauren1; Chapman, Aliya R1 George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1018353265?accountid=14925

Abstract: In intimate partner violence (IPV) risk assessment, there is consensus that a large gap exists between research and practice. This exploratory study interviewed 13 practitioners working with IPV victims to generate ideas about the nature of this gap, and found that only two conducted standardized risk assessment. Others felt imposing structure might detract from the quality of their work. Results support the need for different techniques in different contexts; some adjust only speed of services according to their risk perception, whereas others use in-depth information to customize services. Perspectives appear particularly disparate regarding victim minimization of risk. Implications for future work are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

The Contribution of Childhood Family Violence on Later Intimate Partner Violence Among Robbery Victims

Author: Iverson, Katherine M; Jimenez, Sherlyn; Harrington, Kelly M; Resick, Patricia A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010632778?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the relative contributions of the three forms of childhood family violence exposure on physical intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization among recent robbery victims and tested a gender-matching modeling prediction for IPV risk. Data from a sample of 103 male and 93 female victims of a robbery were analyzed to investigate the effects of exposure to childhood physical abuse (CPA), childhood sexual abuse (CSA), and witnessing parental violence on the likelihood of IPV in adulthood. As expected, witnessing parental violence was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in IPV for both men and women. Neither CPA nor CSA was significantly associated with IPV after accounting for the effect of witnessing parental violence. There was support for the gender-matching hypothesis with men more likely to report IPV if they had witnessed mother-to-father violence and women more likely to report IPV if they had witnessed father-to-mother violence.

A Pattern of Violence: Analyzing the Relationship Between Intimate Partner Violence and Stalking

Author: Norris, Sarah M; Huss, Matthew T; Palarea, Russell E

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010632791?accountid=14925

Abstract: As the literature on stalking has grown, several studies have proposed a relationship between stalking and intimate partner violence (IPV). This study examines a clinical sample of intimate partner batterers to assess the stalking-related behaviors committed against the participants' intimate partners. The study examined the levels of severity between stalking-related behaviors and IPV, as well as identified differences between batterers who exhibited stalking-related behaviors and those who did not. A significant relationship between stalking-related behavior and IPV was found, with more severe stalking related to higher levels of IPV and more extreme psychopathology. Adapted from the source document.

Pandora Doesn't Live Here Anymore: Normalization of Screening for Intimate Partner Violence in Australian Antenatal, Mental Health, and Substance Abuse Services

Author: Spangaro, Jo; Poulos, Roslyn G; Zwi, Anthony B

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010632801?accountid=14925

Abstract: Routine screening for intimate partner violence (IPV) has been widely introduced in health settings, yet screening rates are often low. A screening policy was introduced statewide in Australia in antenatal, mental health, and substance abuse services. Annual snapshot indicates a sustained screening rate of 62%-75% since 2003. Focus group research with health care workers from 10 services found that initial introduction of screening was facilitated by brief, scripted questions embedded into assessment schedules, training, and access to referral services. Over time, familiarity and women's favorable reactions reinforced practice. Barriers remain, including lack of privacy, tensions about limited confidentiality, and frustration when women remain unsafe. Screening added to the complexity of work, but was well accepted by workers, and increased awareness of and responsiveness to IPV. Adapted from the source document.

The Relationship of Alcohol Problems to the Risk for Unidirectional and Bidirectional Intimate Partner Violence Among a Sample of Blue-Collar Couples

Author: Cunradi, Carol B1; Ames, Genevieve M; Duke, Michael1 Prevention Research Center, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 450, Berkeley, CA 94704 cunradi@prev.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914768225?accountid=14925

Abstract: Understanding how each partner's alcohol problems may contribute to the risk of male-to-female only, female-to-male only, or bidirectional partner violence is important for the prevention and treatment of these problems. Multinomial regression analysis was conducted using data from 848 blue-collar couples. Findings suggest that male alcohol problems are linked to male-to-female and bidirectional partner violence but not with female-to-male partner violence. Female alcohol problems do not appear to be related to any type of partner aggression. Each partner's level of impulsivity was associated with bidirectional partner violence. Male impulsivity was associated with male-to-female violence, and female impulsivity was associated with female-to-male violence. Prevention of male alcohol problems and promotion of nonconfrontational conflict-solving techniques may help reduce partner aggression among couples in the general household population. Adapted from the source document.

Women and Men's Use of Coercive Control in Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Robertson, Kirsten1; Murachver, Tamar1 University of Otago, Department of Marketing, P.O. Box 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand kirsten.robertson@otago.ac.nz

Abstract: This study examined the relationship between coercive control and intimate partner violence (IPV) for men and women and for targets and perpetrators. One hundred and seventy-two participants (85 men, 87 women) recruited from three samples reported on their own and their partner's behavior. JPV was measured using the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2). Coercive control was measured using modified items from the Psychological Maltreatment of Women Inventory (PMWI). Coercive control was associated with IPV, and this relationship was similar for men and women across the three samples. In fact, coercive control was predominantly reciprocal in nature, with women and men reporting both receiving and perpetrating controlling behaviors. Overall, coercive controlling behaviors were characteristic of individuals within violent relationships, regardless of their physical abuse status. The experience of violence, rather than gender, was the best predictor of coercive control. Adapted from the source document.

The Effect of Poor Parenting on Male and Female Dating Violence Perpetration and Victimization

Author: Tyler, Kimberly A1; Brownridge, Douglas A; Melander, Lisa A1 University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Department of Sociology, 717 Oldfather Hall, Lincoln, NE 68588-0324

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914767476?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the effects of poor parenting on dating violence perpetration and victimization among approximately 900 males and females from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Results revealed that more physical abuse and low parental warmth were linked to greater substance use and higher rates of delinquency. In addition, low parental warmth, more neglect, and greater delinquency had positive direct effects on dating violence perpetration, whereas more physical abuse, low parental warmth, and increased delinquency were all positively associated with dating violence victimization. Finally, delinquency mediated the link between low parental warmth and dating violence perpetration and victimization. The results provide some support for both social learning theory and an antisocial orientation perspective. Adapted from the source document.

The Influence of Childhood Maltreatment and Self-Control on Dating Violence: A Comparison of College Students in the United States and South Korea

Author: Gover, Angela R; Jennings, Wesley G; Tomsich, Elizabeth A; Park, MiRang; Rennison, Callie Marie

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010631447?accountid=14925

Abstract: Various aspects of social learning and self-control theories have been applied to partner violence among multiple samples in the United States, but these theoretical approaches have been less commonly studied cross-culturally. Consequently, childhood maltreatment and low self-control have been identified as risk factors for various outcomes in primarily American samples. This study examined the relationships between childhood maltreatment, low self-control, and dating violence among college students in South Korea and the United States. Findings indicated that experiencing childhood maltreatment and having low self-control were key predictors of perpetration and victimization for both psychological and physical relationship violence. Witnessing interparental violence during childhood was less consistently predictive of one's involvement in a violent dating relationship. Implications for theory and policy are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence: The Effect of Gender and Contextual Factors on Community Perceptions of Harm, and Suggested Victim and Criminal Justice Responses

Author: Dennison, Susan M; Thompson, Carleen M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010633621?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using a vignette to depict physical violence by an intimate partner, a 2 (perpetrator gender) x 2 (participant gender) x 2 (frequency) x 2 (intent to cause harm) between subjects factorial design was used to examine under what circumstances individuals perceive: an incident should be illegal, the extent of harm, and appropriate victim and criminal justice responses. There were 868 participants from the Brisbane (Australia) community (48.5% males). The actions of male perpetrators were viewed more seriously and the victims were recommended to seek more forms of assistance when the perpetrator was male. There were few differences in perceptions of violence according to participant gender. The frequency of the violence affected the participant's responses but the intentions of the perpetrator did not. Results are discussed in terms of stereotypes of intimate partner violence (IPV) and the implications for help-seeking behavior by victims. Adapted from the source document.

Female Victimization and Intimate Partner Violence After the May 12, 2008, Sichuan Earthquake

Author: Chan, Ko Ling; Zhang, Yulian

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010632803?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the earthquake that occurred on May 12, 2008 in Sichuan, China on stressed families already experiencing domestic violence. We hypothesized that cumulative postdisaster stress would increase marital aggression and that the well-being of victims would deteriorate following the quake. A total of 186 women were recruited for this study. Results show that all types of family violence, including psychological aggression and physical violence between partners, increased after the earthquake. We provided preliminary evidence that psychological aggression was significantly associated with the detrimental effects on victims' mental and physical functioning. The findings support the need for violence assessment among victims of earthquakes, and we recommend that violence prevention be considered as part of the intervention during such natural disasters.

Children's Appraisals as Mediators of the Relationship Between Domestic Violence and Child Adjustment

Author: Fortin, Andree; Doucet, Martin; Damant, Dominique

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010632808?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the relationships among variables that were likely to mediate the effects of exposure to domestic violence on children's internalizing problems (i.e., children's appraisals of domestic violence and their perceptions of family relationships). The study was conducted with 79 children exposed to domestic violence, including 41 boys and 38 girls, aged between 9 and 12 years old. Indicators used for children's appraisals of violence were attribution of blame and perceived threat. Children's perceptions of family relationships were based on their levels of parentification and the degree of their loyalty conflicts. A path analysis was used to verify the predictive model's pathways and to test the multiple mediator effects. Findings confirm the contribution of mediating variables and also reflect the association between self-blame and children's parentification. The results stress the relevance of evaluating the combined role of different potential mediators to provide a better understanding of the impact of domestic violence on children.

Predicting Case Conviction and Domestic Violence Recidivism: Measuring the Deterrent Effects of Conviction and Protection Order Violations

Author: Frantzen, Durant; San Miguel, Claudia; Kwak, Dae-Hoon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010632813?accountid=14925

Abstract: Previous research offered little guidance on sentencing outcomes for protection order (PO) violations in cases of domestic assault and whether PO violation charges affected offender recidivism rates. Using data from local court records, this study examined the effect of PO violation charges on the odds of case conviction relative to dismissal, and whether case conviction or a PO violation charge results in lower domestic violence rearrest rates compared to offenders not receiving these sanctions. The models indicate that PO violation charges has no significant effect on the odds of conviction or recidivism rates, and these trends were not significantly different for convicted versus dismissed offenders. Findings are discussed in relation to previous research with recommendations for future areas of study. Adapted from the source document.

Childhood and Adolescent Violent Victimization and the Risk of Young Adult Intimate Partner Violence Victimization

Author: Murphy, Lisa M11 La Sierra University, Department of Psychology, 1305 Corona Pointe Court, Corona, CA 92879 lmurphy@lasierra.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964186188?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using a nationally representative sample of participants, this study investigates childhood victimization in the home and adolescent violent victimization in the community on the risk of being a victim of intimate partner violence (IPV), general violence, or both during early adulthood. The study findings indicate being left home alone and being physically abused during childhood, and adolescent violent victimization in the community had strong independent effects on an individual's likelihood of becoming a victim of IPV, general violence, or both in early adulthood. The study findings suggest a consistent pattern of victimization across the life course, and intervention programs need to be developed that address the specific needs of children and adolescents at high risk for home and community violent victimization.

Attitudes Toward Dating Violence Among College Students in Mainland China: An Exploratory Study

Author: Anderson, Jared R1; Chen, Wen Chi; Johnson, Matthew D; Lyon, Sarah E; Lee, Chih-Yuan Steven; Zheng, Fuming; Ratcliffe, Gary C; Peterson, F Ryan1 Kansas State University, School of Family Studies and Human Services, 113 Campus Creek Complex, Manhattan, KS 66506

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964186224?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study investigates attitudes toward psychological and physical dating violence among college students in mainland China (n = 245). The results of this study indicate that among our sample of college students in mainland China, men and women were relatively similar in their attitudes toward male perpetrated and female perpetrated physical dating violence and female perpetrated psychological dating violence. As has been found in previous research, men and women in our sample were more accepting of female perpetrated physical and psychological dating violence than male perpetrated physical and psychological dating violence. Finally, among several variables that predicted dating violence attitudes, shame emerged as a potentially important variable to include in future studies on dating violence in Chinese populations.

Attitudes Affecting Physical Dating Violence Perpetration and Victimization: Findings From Adolescents in a High-Risk Urban Community

Author: Ali, Bina1; Swahn, Monica; Hamburger, Merle1 Institute of Public Health, Partnership for Urban Health Research, Georgia State University, P.O. Box 3995, Atlanta, GA 30302-3995

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964186263?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the associations between attitudes supporting physical dating violence against boys hitting girls and girls hitting boys and experiences with physical dating violence perpetration and victimization among youth in a high-risk community. Cross-sectional logistic regression analyses are based on data from the Youth Violence Survey, conducted in 2004, and administered to more than 80% of public school students in grades 7, 9, 11, and 12 (N = 4,131) in an urban school district. Findings show that attitudes supporting physical dating violence against boys and girls are significantly associated with physical dating violence perpetration and victimization. Prevention programs that seek to reduce physical dating violence among adolescents may benefit from including sex-specific attitude modification as part of a comprehensive violence prevention approach. Adapted from the source document.

The Gender Asymmetric Effect of Intimate Partner Violence on Relationship Satisfaction

Author: Ackerman, Jeff1; Field, Layton1 Department of Sociology, Texas A & M University, 311 Academic Building MS 4351, College Station, TX

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1018358864?accountid=14925

Abstract: Our research examined the association between intimate partner violence and relationship satisfaction among victims. The negative association between victimization and relationship satisfaction was substantially stronger for females than for males. Comparisons between respondents reporting about same-sex relationships with those reporting about opposite-sex relationships provided evidence that the amplified victimization/satisfaction association among female victims is a victim-gender effect rather than an actor-gender effect. In other words, our findings suggest that aggression harms the quality of the intimate partnerships of females much more so than the partnerships of males regardless of whether a male or a female is the perpetrator. We supplemented dialogue about the direct implications of our findings with discussions about how these results may raise conceptual questions about the adequacy of the instruments scholars use to study partner aggression. Adapted from the source document.

Antisociality and Intimate Partner Violence: The Facilitating Role of Shame

Author: Kivisto, Aaron J1; Kivisto, Katherine L; Moore, Todd M; Rhatigan, Deborah L1 Children and the Law Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, 151 Merrimac Street, 3rd Floor, Suite 3, Boston, MA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1018338832?accountid=14925

Abstract: Numerous theories classify distinct subtypes of men who perpetrate violence against female partners. These theories contend that a large portion of these men possess antisocial characteristics that may increase risk for violence. Affectively, these men have been found to externalize their emotions, including shame and guilt, and it has been suggested that this process contributes to the perpetration of partner violence. Therefore, this study sought to examine the role of shame and guilt in the association between antisociality and partner violence perpetration (i.e., psychological, physical, and sexual). Based on a sample of 423 undergraduate men, this study found that shame moderated the association between antisociality and partner violence perpetration such that as shame increases, the associations between antisociality and all three types of partner violence perpetration increase. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of typological models of partner violence and have clinical implications for batterer intervention programs.

Abstract: This article reports a study of how mothers perceive the effects of intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy and children's exposure to IPV: (a) Do interactional aspects of IPV have a negative impact on the fetus during pregnancy or on the newborn baby? and (b) Is there a relationship between interactional aspects of IPV and (a) children's risk of being exposed to IPV and (b) the age of the child when at risk for exposure to IPV? A representative sample of 137 IPV help-seeking mothers in Norway was interviewed. Severity of physical IPV and injury from sexual IPV increased the risk of consequences to the fetus. Frequency of physical and psychological IPV increased the likelihood of children's exposure. Duration of the partnership increased the risk of children's exposure to physical and sexual IPV. Finally, there was a negative linear association between children's age when exposed for the first time and frequency of physical and psychological IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Police Response to Intimate Partner Violence in Canada: Do Victim Characteristics Matter?

Author: Barrett, Betty Jo1; St Pierre, Melissa; Vaillancourt, Nadine1 School of Social Work, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862598659?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the role of sociodemographic factors and violence characteristics in influencing women's reporting behaviors and types of police intervention received in response to intimate partner violence (IPV) in Canada. A subset of female respondents to Canada's 1999 General Social Survey who experienced physical or sexual IPV by a male perpetrator and who had contact with the police as a result of the violence was used for this analysis (n=383). Findings suggest significant racial, economic, and social variations in women's motivation for self-reporting violence to the police as well as in the types of law enforcement interventions administered by police in response to reports of IPV. Implications for policy development are examined. Adapted from the source document.

HIV Testing Behavior among Pacific Islanders in Southern California: Exploring the Importance of Race/Ethnicity, Knowledge, and Domestic Violence

Abstract: This article presents an analysis of a 2008 community needs assessment survey of a convenience sample of 179 Pacific Islander respondents in southern California; the needs assessment focused on HIV knowledge, HIV testing behavior, and experience with intimate partner/relationship violence. Multivariate logistic regression results indicated that race/ethnicity and reported experience with intimate partner/relationship violence were the most important variables in explaining the variation in reported HIV testing among Chamorro/Guamanian and Samoan respondents. However, when analyzed separately, self-reported experience with intimate partner/relationship violence was associated with reported HIV testing only for Chamorro respondents and not for Samoan respondents. As U.S. Pacific Islanders experience a high degree of HIV health disparities, additional research is needed to clarify the links among race/ethnicity, intimate partner/relationship violence, and HIV testing behavior. Adapted from the source document.

Managing accountability for domestic violence: Identities, membership categories and morality in perpetrators' talk

Author: LeCouteur, Amanda1; Oxlad, Melissa1 The University of Adelaide, Australia, amanda.lecouteur@adelaide.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/852136100?accountid=14925

Abstract: Psychological research and popular discussion around domestic violence/intimate partner abuse have focussed on broad features of descriptive accounts such as victim precipitation, excusing of aggressors, and minimizing or denying the violence. Few studies have examined the finer detail of how such matters are routinely invoked in talk, and how they are regularly built in ways that make their authors appear credible and warranted. This study uses a discursive psychological approach to examine the talk of men recruited from domestic violence counselling groups who participated in one-on-one interviews about their violent/abusive behaviour. The analytic focus is on instances of situated identity categorization in these men's accounts that involved the consequential moral assessment of self and partner in ways that justify or warrant violence/abuse. Routinely, in these men's talk about their abused partner, subtle and particular categorizations associated with being a woman were worked up sequentially to depict her as having breached the normative moral order. These warranting practices were evident in the talk of both men who denied, and who overtly acknowledged, the wrongness of their violent/abusive actions. The findings raise important issues for understanding how commonsense reasoning around the causes of domestic violence and its justifiability is sustained, as well as having practical implications for theory, prevention and treatment.

Leaving Jekyll and Hyde: Emotion work in the context of intimate partner violence

Author: Enander, Viveka11 Institutionen for socialt arbete/Department of Social Work Goteborg SE-405 30, Sweden aqut@hotmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/856405841?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this qualitative study was to investigate battered women's emotion work in the context of male-to-female intimate partner violence and, more specifically, in the context of leaving violent men. A total of 22 informants were interviewed and the material consists of 47 interviews. The results suggest a process in which victims initially conceptualize abusers as good, but subjection to violence leads to a cognitive-emotive dissonance that is responded to by emotion work. Over time, conceptualizations of the abuser shift from good to bad and efforts are made to change emotions from warm to cold. Connections between this process and previously described leaving processes are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

The SHARE Project: Maximizing Participant Retention in a Longitudinal Study with Victims of Intimate Partner Violence

Abstract: Retaining victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) in longitudinal research is challenging, as abused women often face safety concerns, housing and employment instability, poverty, and major life transitions, making it difficult to locate and retain participants at follow-up time points. This article builds on past research to describe individualized, technology-based retention strategies for hard-to-reach populations, which minimize participant loss while maintaining participant safety. These techniques have resulted in retention rates of 94% at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up interviews in a sample of 278 women experiencing both IPV and housing instability. The authors discuss the ethical use of appropriate technology for maximizing retention of participants as well as the importance of adjusting retention activities to meet the individual safety needs of each participant.

The effects of dating violence, substance use and risky sexual behavior among a diverse sample of Illinois youth

Author: Alleyne, Binta1; Coleman-Cowger, Victoria H; Crown, Laurel; Gibbons, Maya A; Vines, Linda Nicole1 Jane Addams College of Social Work (MC 309) University of Illinois at Chicago, 1040 West Harrison Street, Chicago, Illinois 60607-7134, United States balleyne@uic.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862780505?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between dating violence, forced sexual intercourse (FSI), and four measures of sexual risk taking (i.e., age at first sex, number of recent (within the last three months) sex partners, alcohol/drug use at last sex, and condom use at last sex) among a sample of 1124 ethnically diverse sexually active adolescents in Illinois. Given conflicting reports regarding the role of gender in dating violence, and the dearth of research examining the role of gender in relations between dating violence, sexual violence, and sexual risk taking, we also examine whether gender moderates the relation between these constructs. The findings indicate significant relationships among dating violence and FSI and age at first sex, number of sexual partners, and condom use across various ethnic groups. Findings also show that when controlling for gender, dating violence and FSI are related to number of sexual partners and age at first intercourse regardless of ethnic group identification.

Media Representations of Intimate Partner Violence and Punishment Preferences: Exploring the Role of Attributions and Emotions

Author: Palazzolo, Kellie E; Roberto, Anthony J

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896167807?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines Weiner's attribution-emotion-action model using news stories derived from existent media messages about intimate partner violence containing information designed to increase or decrease attributions of responsibility both toward the perpetrator and toward the victim. Participants (N=251) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions, exposed to a stimulus message, then completed a survey. The attribution-emotion-action model was largely supported. Although multiple emotions were experienced, only certain emotions were significant in determining punishment preference, and these emotions varied by target (i.e., perpetrator or victim).

Abstract: There has been increased advocacy to involve healthcare providers in domestic violence prevention through screening for it in healthcare. The extent and determinants of screening for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) against women in a healthcare facility in Kano, Nigeria was assessed. Two hundred and seventy four healthcare providers responded to the Domestic violence healthcare provider survey probing the frequency of screening for IPV, staff attitudes towards domestic abuse, efficacy in screening, availability of support networks and staff/patient safety in regard to IPV inquiry. T-test and logistic regression were employed to study determinants of screening. The majority of participants (74%) had not screened for IPV during the preceding 3months. Male gender, old age, and being of Yoruba ethnic belonging increased the likelihood of screening. With increasing perceived efficacy and increasing blame of the victim for abuse the likelihood of screening for IPV increased. Implications of findings for staff education and research are discussed.

Naming the Unmentionable: How Children Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence Articulate Their Experiences

Author: Georgsson, Anna1; Almqvist, Kjerstin; Broberg, Anders G1 Department of Psychology, University of Gothenburg, P.O Box500, SE405 30, Gothenburg, Sweden anna.georgsson@psy.gu.se

Abstract: Witnessing intimate partner violence (IPV) is a frightening experience that affects children's development and well-being. This study examines experiences of IPV from the perspective of children. Interviews with 14 children between 8 and 12years of age were analyzed using a thematic method. Three main themes were identified: how children talked about abuse of their mother, described their own actions, and related to or handled memories of violence. Most children confirmed that their mother had been the victim of abuse, but had difficulties describing these experiences. Narratives were often incoherent and difficult to fully understand. In contrast, most of the children seemed to find it easier to describe their own actions during violence and conflicts. Not thinking about IPV was a strategy that aimed at reducing unwanted memories; it is also a strategy that may obstruct creating a narrative. Adapted from the source document.

Awareness of Domestic Violence Within the Evangelical Community: Romania and Moldova

Author: Asay, Sylvia M11 University of Nebraska at Kearney, Otto Olsen 206, Kearney, NE, 68849, USA asays@unk.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/852897907?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence is a serious problem worldwide and is often perpetuated by complex social and cultural factors. The former post-communist countries of Romania and Moldova are no exception despite recent social attention. Many evangelical churches have not addressed this problem. The purpose of this project was to begin to assess the understanding of clergy and congregation members from evangelical churches in Romania and Moldova about domestic violence. Findings indicate that domestic violence occurs within the evangelical church in both Romania and Moldova, and that cultural and religious factors influence its prevalence. Suggestions for further research and training are included. Adapted from the source document.

Wives' Attitudes Toward Gender Roles and Their Experience of Intimate Partner Violence by Husbands in Central Province, Sri Lanka

Author: Jayatilleke, Achini1; Poudel, Krishna C; Sakisaka, Kayako; Yasuoka, Junko; Jayatilleke, Achala Upendra; Jimba, Masamine1 University of Tokyo, Japan, mjimba@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/854233829?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors conducted a community based, cross-sectional study to describe the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) by husbands and the association between wives' attitudes toward gender roles and their experience of IPV in Central Province, Sri Lanka. This article included a representative sample of 624 wives between 15 and 49 years of age and examined the prevalence of physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. Then, using multivariate logistic regression analysis, the authors examined the association between wives' attitudes toward gender roles and IPV. Of the 624 wives, 36% had experienced at least one episode of physical, psychological, or sexual abuse by their husbands during their life time (ever abuse), and 19% had experienced such abuse during the past 12 months (current abuse). The wives were less likely to experience current abuse by husbands if they believed that "outsiders should not intervene to protect abused wives." They were more likely to experience ever and current isolated psychological abuse by husbands if they did not believe that "a good wife always obeys her husband." This study suggests that the prevalence of IPV is high in Sri Lanka. Although several published studies on IPV suggest that traditional gender role attitudes tend to increase women's vulnerability to IPV, this study suggests that in Sri Lanka, the wives who respect cultural norms tend to experience less IPV by husbands.

Narrative Possibilities: Poor Women of Color and the Complexities of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Boonzaier, Floretta A1; van Schalkwyk, Samantha1 University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862597423?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article shows how a narrative methodological approach is particularly suited to examining the dynamics of intimate partner violence, especially among poor women of color in South Africa. We show how a narrative approach allowed women to represent their experiences of violence according to their own frames of meaning, examining the complexities of abuse as it is informed by sociocultural factors of gender, poverty, and deprivation. In particular, we show how a narrative approach departs from other qualitative work by enabling women to construct particular forms of identity, thereby giving them agency in authoring their own stories of violence.

Interdisciplinary Linkage of Community Psychology and Cross-Cultural Psychology: History, Values, and an Illustrative Research and Action Project on Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Mankowski, Eric S; Galvez, Gino; Glass, Nancy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/853216275?accountid=14925

Abstract: An analysis of the respective organizational histories, missions, and scholarly activity of the International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology and the Society for Community Research and Action was conducted in order to inform the development of interdisciplinary linkages between members of the two organizations. The analysis revealed many points of shared values and actions, as well as some important differences. Both scholarly organizations developed out of a similar historical and cultural zeitgeist in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The missions emphasize the role of culture/diversity in psychological phenomena, adopting an interdisciplinary orientation, the value of collaboration, the importance of research method and ethics, and the value of action research. However, community psychology generally lacks an adequate treatment of cultural phenomena while cross-cultural psychology often fails to draw on community and participatory methods useful for understanding culture in context. These common roots and differences are examined. Finally, we describe a community based, participatory research and intervention project to address intimate partner violence among Latinos and European-Americans living in Oregon. Analysis of the research process and on some of our initial findings illustrates challenges and potential benefits of an interdisciplinary, cultural community psychology. Adapted from the source document.

Norms and Costs of Government Domestic Violence Policies: A Critical Review

Author: Foster, Benjamin P11 School of Accountancy, College of Business, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, 40292, USA ben.foster@louisville.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322718777?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence and governmental domestic violence policies impact many families and produce considerable economic costs. This paper reviews literature related to domestic violence including false claims of domestic violence. Domestic violence literature is considered in relation to economic literature on norm theory and the procedural justice concept. Norm theory provides a basis to understand and evaluate domestic violence policies and offer suggestions regarding those policies. Current norms may encourage overly aggressive governmental response to claims of domestic violence, provide an incentive to file false claims in some cases, and provide little if any penalty for filing false claims. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Domestic violence is a serious problem with far-reaching consequences. This study applies a new methodology to derive subtypes of male perpetrators of intimate partner violence. As part of a larger National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-funded study, a national sample of randomly selected psychologists and psychiatrists describe 188 adult male patients (59 with a history of partner violence, 97 with a history of arrests but not partner violence, and 57 with neither partner violence nor arrests), using the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure-II (SWAP-II), a Q-sort procedure for assessing personality pathology. Using Q-factor analysis, the authors identify three personality constellations among the partner-violent men, two of which strongly resembled subtypes identified using different methods in prior research: psychopathic, hostile/controlling, and borderline/dependent The authors compare these subtypes with each other and with nonarrested/nonviolent men and men with arrests but no partner violence on Axis I and II diagnoses, adaptive functioning, etiological variables, and response to treatment, providing initial validity data.

Abstract: Teen dating violence is a serious public health concern with numerous and long-lasting consequences. Although alcohol and drug use have been associated with dating violence, little is known about the role of specific substances, especially the use of club drugs and the nonmedical use of prescription drugs. Thus, the authors examined the association between dating violence victimization and the use of a variety of licit and illicit substances among 1,565 ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged high school students in southeast Texas. Past year dating violence victimization was reported by 14.1 % of boys and 11.3% of girls. Compared to their nonabused counterparts, youth who experienced dating violence were more likely to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, binge drink alcohol, sniff glue to get high, use marijuana, use ecstasy, use Vicodin, and use Xanax. However, with the exception of alcohol and cigarettes, all substances were reduced to nonsignificance in multivariate analyses. No differences were found in the rate of dating violence between African American, White, and Hispanic adolescents. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Experience of Hurricane Katrina and Reported Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Harville, Emily W1; Taylor, Catherine A; Tesfai, Helen; Xiong, Xu; Buekens, Pierre1 Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine E-mail: eharvill@tulane.edu

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been associated with stress, but few studies have examined the effect of natural disaster on IPV. In this study, the authors examine the relationship between experience of Hurricane Katrina and reported relationship aggression and violence in a cohort of 123 postpartum women. Hurricane experience is measured using a series of questions about damage, injury, and danger during the storm; IPV was measured using the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS-2). Multiple log-poisson regression was used to calculate relative risks (RRs), adjusted for potential confounders. Most participants report that they and their partners had explained themselves to each other, showed each other respect, and also insulted, swore, or shouted during conflicts with each other. A few participants report physical violence, sexual force, or destroying property, though in each case at least 5% endorse that it had happened at least once in the last 6 months. Another few report that they and their partners had carried out these actions. Experiencing damage due to the storm is associated with increased likelihood of most conflict tactics. Strong RRs are seen for the relationship between damage due to the storm and aggression or violence, especially being insulted, sworn, shouted, or yelled at (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.23,95% CI = 1.02-1.48); pushed, shoved, or slapped (aRR = 5.28,95% CI = 1.93-14.45); or being punched, kicked, or beat up (aRR = 8.25,95% CI = 1.68-40.47). Results suggest that certain experiences of the hurricane are associated with an increased likelihood of violent methods of conflict resolution. Relief and medical workers may need to be aware of the possibility of increased IPV after disaster. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Threats and Acts of Intimate Partner Violence Reported by Users at Norwegian Women's Shelters

Author: Alsaker, Kjersti1; Kristoffersen, Kjell; Moen, Bente E; Baste, Valborg1 University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway kjersti.alsaker@isf.uib.no

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/862598492?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women (n = 87) at women's shelters in Norway, a country of high welfare and gender equality, reported a multitude of severe threats and actual acts of physical, sexual and psychological violence. An individual threatening to kill his partner represented a significant increased risk for experiencing serious acts of violence, especially when the threats were repeated. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to all the women's shelters. Experiences of violence were measured by The Severity of Violence against Women Scale (SVAWS) and the Psychological Maltreatment of Women Index (PMWI).

Psychometric Properties of an Intimate Partner Violence Tool for Health Care Students

Author: Connor, Pamela D1; Nouer, Simonne S; Mackey, See Trail N; Tipton, Nathan G; Lloyd, Angela K1 University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis dconnor@utmem.edu

Abstract: Health care professionals have acknowledged intimate partner violence (IPV) as a highly prevalent public health problem necessitating the creation of standardized education programs, survey tools, and well-defined outcome measures. Testing and evaluation of these measures, however, has been limited to specific populations of health care professionals. In 2007 and 2008, psychometric properties of the Physician Readiness to Manage Intimate Partner Violence Survey (PREMIS) were adapted, tested, and evaluated on a group of medicine, nursing, social work, and dentistry students during their last semester of college. The adapted instrument demonstrated high reliability within some IPV constructs, and six of the eight scales described in the original PREMIS were identified. Three scales presented a Cronbach's alpha >= .70, demonstrating acceptable reliability, and a new scale, IPV Screening, was also identified that showed good reliability (alpha = .74). The adapted instrument showed good stability of psychometric properties in the student population and generally good correlation within several measures.

Running the risk: police officer discretion and family violence in New Zealand

Author: Grant, Stephanie1; Rowe, Michael1 School of Social and Cultural Studies, Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902084839?accountid=14925

Abstract: As in other jurisdictions, the police in New Zealand have a poor record of responding to domestic violence, a category of crime widely perceived within New Zealand to be a particularly extensive problem relative to other societies. Against that background policy developments have focused on developing risk assessment techniques as a basis for identifying cases of family and domestic violence that are likely to escalate. Using interviews with frontline police officers, this article explores police officers' attitudes towards these investigating methods and their experiences of interviewing victims of family violence in order to gain information about risk. It is argued that while officer attitudes towards risk assessment in general terms might vary, in practice the majority of officers do not complete risk assessment processes in accordance with police policy, even if they support the practice in principle. The reasons for this, it is argued, have more to do with officer negotiation of the demands of routine patrol work and time-management processes that contribute to the marginalisation of bureaucratic procedures. Supervisors and managers compound the perception that these tasks are of second-order importance. In these ways there are cultural and managerial barriers to the more effective policing of family violence; however, the reduction of officer discretion through policy and procedure seems unlikely to provide a viable solution. A professional practice model might be more effective if officers can be trained and educated about the role of risk assessment in this context and the importance of their role as data collectors; although this does not fit easily with traditional concepts of 'real policework'. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence against Women in Slovenia: A Public Problem?

Author: Medaric, Zorana11 Science and research centre of Koper, University of Primorska Koper, Slovenia zorana.medaric@zrs.upr.si

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881463732?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article deals with violence against women within the family and the question to what extent it is identified as a relevant public (social and political) problem in Slovenia. The analysis touches upon changes at the policy level; however the main focus is placed on the public opinion, as it reflects the degree of recognition and acceptance of these problems in a society, as well as beliefs framing it. The empirical analysis of the public opinion survey on domestic violence in Slovenia shows that dual views on violence against women exist. On one hand, the public in Slovenia is aware of the problem of violence against women and it recognizes, discusses and defines it as a social problem and responsibility, while on the other hand it displays a relatively high level of tolerance for certain forms of violence and the belief that domestic violence is a private matter The public (at least in part) thus often reproduces stereotypical beliefs and myths about violence against women within the family and does not recognize it as a broader social problem. Adapted from the source document.

Interpreting Multi-Agency Partnerships: Ideology, Discourse and Domestic Violence

Author: Harvie, Peter1; Manzi, Tony1 University of Westminster, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902080393?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines local multi-agency responses to local domestic violence, in particular considering how the introduction of local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRP) in the UK in the late 1990s affected service provision. Using a longitudinal case study, the article considers how feminist ideologies have been supplanted by a combination of judicial processes and bureaucratic politics. These developments are represented by three dominant discourses: 'criminal justice', 'managerialism' and 'equalities'; discourses that have had a number of consequences in the implementation of domestic violence policy. The first is that a one-dimensional criminal justice discourse has displaced a feminist political, power and control, analysis. Second, the ascendancy of managerialism has allowed prescriptive short-term performance measurement to prevail over long-term 'sufferer-orientated' responses, and finally an 'equalities' discourse prioritized perpetrator initiatives and discouraged dissent. The result has been the dominance of the statutory sector, a marginalization of voluntary agencies and a partial alienation of women's groups; a process which has proved detrimental both to the interests of female sufferers (who form approximately 90 per cent of victims of domestic violence) as well as voluntary agencies.

Abstract: We undertook a synthesis of existing studies to re-evaluate the evidence on program mechanisms of intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening and disclosure within a health care context by addressing how, for whom, and in what circumstances these programs work. Our review is informed by a realist review approach, which focuses on program mechanisms. Systematic, realist reviews can help reveal why and how interventions work and can yield information to inform policies and programs. A review of the scholarly literature from January 1990 to July 2010 identified 5046 articles, 23 of which were included in our study. We identified studies on 17 programs that evaluated IPV screening. We found that programs that took a comprehensive approach (i.e., incorporated multiple program components, including institutional support) were successful in increasing IPV screening and disclosure/identification rates. Four program components appeared to increase provider self-efficacy for screening, including institutional support, effective screening protocols, thorough initial and ongoing training, and immediate access/referrals to onsite and/or offsite support services. These findings support a multi-component comprehensive IPV screening program approach that seeks to build provider self-efficacy for screening. Further implications for IPV screening intervention planning and implementation in health care settings are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

Justification of Intimate Partner Violence in Rural Bangladesh: What Survey Questions Fail to Capture

Abstract: This article presents qualitative findings from a project designed to develop better methodological tools for clarifying women's and men's attitudes about intimate partner violence (IPV) in rural Bangladesh and their perceptions of norms about IPV in their communities. Cognitive interviews and focus-group discussions were used to explore respondents' subjective understanding of standard survey questions meant to elicit attitudes about IPV. We find that the proportion of participants who justified IPV under some circumstances increased when additional context was provided, suggesting that the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) questions may underrepresent the proportions of people who condone IPV. Moreover, most people in this social context also believed that IPV often goes beyond socially sanctioned limits and that something should be done to stop it-an important caveat that the DHS questions are not designed to capture. These findings suggest that incorporation of additional context into questions on IPV attitudes would make responses to these questions more meaningful. Adapted from the source document.

A Stop-Start Response: Social Services' Interventions with Children and Families Notified following Domestic Violence Incidents

Author: Stanley, Nicky1; Miller, Pam; Richardson Foster, Helen; Thomson, Gill1 School of Social Work, University of Central Lancashire, Preston PR1 2HE Nstanley@oclan.ac.uk

Abstract: The harm consequent on children's exposure to domestic violence is recognised in legislation in England and Wales. This paper reports on a study of the social work response to 184 families notified by the police to children's services in two English authorities. Families were tracked through case records over 21 months subsequent to the notification. The perspectives of social services' practitioners and managers were also captured through interviews. Only a small proportion of families received a service in the form of an initial assessment or further intervention; the notification triggered a service for just five per cent of families. Families who received a warning letter only were just as likely to be re-referred as those who met with no response. Those families receiving a service were likely to experience repeated notifications and assessments. The limited time period for completing assessments contributed to initial assessments worker's lack of engagement with perpetrators of domestic violence. Current structures for assessments for assessment and intervention contribute to a stop-start pattern of social work that seems ill-suited to building the trust and engagement needed to challenge the complex and enduring experience of domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

The Life History Calendar Method and Multilevel Modeling: Application to Research on Intimate Partner Violence

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is prevalent and often recurrent in women's lives. To better understand the changing risk of IPV over the life course, which could guide more effective policies and program responses, methodological innovations are needed. Life History Calendar methods enhance respondents' recall of the timing of specific types of IPV experienced over the life course. Multilevel modeling provides a way to analyze individual and collective trajectories and examine covariates of IPV risk. We apply these complementary methods to examine IPV trajectories for a sample of women of Filipina descent living in the United States, examining life course timing and cohort effects.

The Need for Experimental Methodology in Intimate Partner Violence: Finding Programs That Effectively Prevent IPV

Author: Feder, Lynette1; Holditch Niolon, Phyllis; Campbell, Jacquelyn; Wallinder, Jan; Nelson, Robin; Larrouy, Hattie1 Portland State University, University Center Building -- INR Mail Drop, 1881 SW 5th Avenue, Room 335R, Portland, OR 97201 E-Mail: Lfeder@pdx.edu

Abstract: The lack of rigorous evaluations of intimate partner violence (IPV) programs has severely limited our knowledge about what works. However, IPV programs can be rigorously evaluated through randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted ethically and safely. This article provides an example of how a RCT to test an IPV preventive intervention -- the Enhanced Nurse Family Partnership Study (ENFPS) -- was successfully implemented by a partnership of researchers and practitioners. The article concludes with some recommendations, arrived at by the researchers and practitioners on the ENFPS team, for achieving a successful collaboration thought to be essential in executing a field experiment.

Examining Systems Change in the Response to Domestic Violence: Innovative Applications of Multilevel Modeling

Abstract: Facilitating systems change in the response to domestic violence has been touted as a central goal in the effort to hold systems accountable and create a coordinated response for survivors. However, examination of systems change and whether particular social change efforts (e.g., coordinating councils) contribute to such change is a notoriously difficult research endeavor due in large part to methodological barriers, including those that stem from nonexperimental designs and complex data that are characterized as nested and measured in proportions. This article describes important methodological challenges and proposes innovative techniques to address these challenges. Specifically, multilevel modeling is applied to examine two key systems markers, including protection order and domestic violence program referral rates over time in one state. For each marker, the methodological approach is highlighted and innovations in employing multilevel modeling are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Cost-Effectiveness of Health Care Interventions to Address Intimate Partner Violence: What Do We Know and What Else Should We Look for?

Author: Gold, Lisa1; Norman, Richard; Devine, Angela; Feder, Gene; Taft, Angela J; Hegarty, Kelsey L1 Deakin Health Economics, Deakin University, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Victoria 3125, Australia E-mail: lisa.gold@deakin.edu.au

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) creates a substantial burden of disease and significant costs to families, communities, and governments. Building the evidence for effective interventions to reduce violence and its sequelae requires increased use of economic evaluation to inform policy through the analysis of costs and potential savings of interventions. The authors review existing economic evaluations and present case studies of current research from the United Kingdom and Australia to illustrate the strengths and limitations of two approaches to generating economic evidence: economic evaluation alongside randomized controlled trials and economic modeling. Economic evaluation should always be considered in the design of IPV intervention research. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Physician Practices in Response to Intimate Partner Violence in Southern India: Insights from a Qualitative Study

Abstract: Health care providers in India are often the only institutional contact for women experiencing intimate partner violence, a pervasive public health problem with adverse health outcomes. This qualitative study was among the first to examine Indian primary care physicians' intimate partner violence practices. Between July 2007 and January 2008, 30 in-depth interviews were conducted with physicians serving low-to-middle income women aged 18-30 in southern India. A modified grounded theory approach was used for data collection and analysis. Study findings revealed a distinct subset of 'physician champions' who responded to intimate partner violence more consistently, informed women of their rights, and facilitated their utilization of support services. Findings also offered insights into physicians' ability to identify indications of intimate partner violence and use of potentially culturally appropriate practices to respond to intimate partner violence, even without training. However, physician practices were mediated by individual attitudes. Although not generalizable, findings offer some useful lessons which may be transferable for adaptation to other settings. A potential starting point is to study physicians' current practices, focusing on their safety and efficacy, as well as enhancing these practices through appropriate training. Further research is also needed on women's perspectives on the appropriateness of physicians' practices, and women's recommendations for intimate partner violence intervention strategies.

The Relationship Between Adolescents' Experience of Family Violence and Dating Violence

Abstract: This study examines whether experiences of familial victimization and aggression are potential risk factors for dating violence in male and female teenage relationships. The authors compare 471 adolescents aged 12 to 19 in the care of a youth protection agency and from a community sample. Results show that adolescents carry negative childhood experiences of family violence into their intimate relationships in different ways, depending on gender and level of risk. Female adolescents who had been victimized by either of their parents were at greater risk for revictimization, but not aggression, within their dating relationships. High-risk adolescent males who reported childhood victimization were at a particularly high risk of being aggressive toward their girlfriends, especially if they were harshly disciplined by their father. The extent of aggression toward parents predicted aggression toward dating partners, particularly for girls. The authors discuss these findings in terms of prevention and early intervention efforts.

Testing the Cycle of Violence Hypothesis: Child Abuse and Adolescent Dating Violence as Predictors of Intimate Partner Violence in Young Adulthood

Author: Manchikanti Gomez, Anu11 Department of Maternal and Child Health, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Rosenau Hall, CB 7445, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7445 E-mail: agomez@unc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/875714840?accountid=14925

Abstract: Child abuse is an important determinant of future violence perpetration and victimization. Past research examining linkages between child abuse and adult intimate partner violence (IPV) has predominantly focused on married individuals and not considered adolescent dating violence. In the present study, data from three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health are used to examine the impact of child abuse and adolescent dating violence on the likelihood of IPV victimization and perpetration in young adulthood. Child abuse and adolescent dating violence are common in this study population and are highly predictive of IPV. In regression models stratified by gender, child abuse and adolescent dating violence are significant predictors of IPV victimization and perpetration for both men and women, but the magnitude of these associations differs by gender. Although gender difference exist, it appears that experiencing violence during childhood and/or adolescence is highly predictive of IPV in young adulthood.

Gendered suffering: married Miao women's narratives on domestic violence in southwest China

Author: Ku, Benjamin H B11 China Research and Development Network, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520319626?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper is based on our oral testimonial projects in Guizhou province in Southwest China. Since 1999, we have employed oral testimony as one of the community development strategies and methods to study the life histories of Miao ethnic minority women in China's impoverished rural regions. By employing this method, we aim to empower the marginalized Miao women, and help them explore their hidden voices and learn about their life experiences, their views on their relationship with their husbands, families, communities, and other social forces that shape their livelihoods. Local women's narratives, especially those of married women, demonstrated their eagerness to talk about their lives as well as their suffering from family burdens, family discord, domestic violence, alcoholism, and other issues which were beyond our agenda. We finally found that suffering is the collective experience of married women, and domestic violence is a major source of women's suffering. This paper seeks to examine how the patriarchal system, rural poverty, and traditional cultural practices intertwine in shaping women's lives and contribute to women's suffering in everyday life. Adapted from the source document.

Chinese male victims in intimate partner violence in the United States: examining help-seeking behaviours through a systems perspective

Author: Tsui, Venus1; Cheung, Monit1 Graduate College of Social Work, University of Houston, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1520318789?accountid=14925

Abstract: Few researchers who studied intimate partner violence (IPV) have focused on the relationship between the needs of male victims and their help-seeking behaviours. In addition, there is a lack of research relating to the needs of Chinese male victims of IPV. To facilitate research in this area, the authors utilized a dynamic systems perspective to build a conceptual framework to examine the help-seeking behaviours of Chinese-American males who are victims in violent relationships. This conceptual framework uses a social focus and analyses connections among major system components, such as culture, society, family, and the male victim as an individual. The authors identified four key analytical categories (cultural changes, societal expectations, influences of the family, and reactions to victimization) that practitioners and researchers can use to gain insight into the help-seeking behaviours of Chinese-American men. We anticipate that the conceptual framework can be used in future research to expand knowledge of male victimization and design effective intervention strategies. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Victimization and Perpetration by Puerto Rican Women with Severe Mental Illnesses

Author: Friedman, Susan Hatters1; Loue, Sana; Goldman Heaphy, Emily L; Mendez, Nancy1 Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, 11100 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896165292?accountid=14925

Abstract: Previous research indicates a higher prevalence of victimization among severely mentally ill women. Few studies have either compared these levels across diagnostic categories or evaluated perpetration by the women. We report qualitative and quantitative findings regarding intimate partner violence perpetrated both against and by a sample of 53 Puerto Rican women diagnosed with major depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. Interviewers shadowed participants for a period of 2 years. Two-thirds of the women with serious mental illness had histories of victimization. However, 23% of the women also reported histories of violence towards their significant others. This was attributed to various reasons, such as anger, revenge, control, and self-defense. Participants described their personal conceptualization of the violence they received and perpetrated. This has implications for programs designed to prevent family violence, for health care professionals in general, and for psychiatrists, who may be called upon to address future risk of victimization or commission of violence. Adapted from the source document.

Mandatory, Preferred, or Discretionary: How the Classification of Domestic Violence Warrantless Arrest Laws Impacts Their Estimated Effects on Intimate Partner Homicide

Author: Zeoli, April M1; Norris, Alexis; Brenner, Hannah1 School of Criminal Justice, Michigan State University, MI, USA zeoli@msu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887498716?accountid=14925

Abstract: Warrantless arrest laws for domestic violence (DV) are generally classified as discretionary, preferred, or mandatory, based on the level of power accorded to police in deciding whether to arrest. However, there is a lack of consensus in the literature regarding how each state's law should be categorized. Using three classification schemes, this study examined whether variations among these schemes impact research outcomes by analyzing the effects of discretionary, preferred, and mandatory warrantless arrest laws on intimate partner homicide (IPH). Variations in classification schemes and in the dates of law passage presented in the literature resulted in differing estimated effects of the laws.

Latino Church Leaders and Domestic Violence: Attitudes and Knowledge

Author: Ames, Natalie1; Hancock, Tina U; Behnke, Andrew O1 Department of Social Work, North Carolina State University natalie_ames@ncsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347786071?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes two focus groups that explored Latino church leaders' attitudes and knowledge about domestic violence. Participants were well aware of the intergenerational nature of domestic violence and suggested both religious and secular interventions. They were opposed to separation or divorce and did not view abusers as being responsible for their violent behavior. Some participants disclosed significant personal experience with domestic violence. Results suggest that efforts to engage Latino church leaders in domestic violence prevention/intervention should acknowledge the religious and cultural importance of keeping families together, build on the positive aspects of traditional male/female roles in Latino cultures, and incorporate opportunities for sharing and healing from personal experiences.

Youth Attitudes Toward Dating Violence in Thailand

Author: Pradubmook-Sherer, Penchan11 Mahidol University, Salaya Campus, Nakornchaisri, Thailand penmook@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881469275?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study assessed the occurrences and intensity of psychological, physical, and sexual attitudes toward dating violence among Thai youths, and examined possible variables related to the formation of these attitudes. The random sample consisted of 1,296 male and female adolescents from high school, vocational school, and out-of-school groups. Thai youths in general reported attitudes that were supportive of dating violence. The variables more closely related to attitudes toward dating violence were personal variables. Peer influence, partner relationships, and family characteristics were related to higher support for dating violence. Females reported higher endorsement of dating violence than males. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed, and recommendations for policy makers are drawn. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Domestic Violence against Women: Statistical Analysis of Crimes across India

Author: Hackett, Michelle11 International Studies, School of History & Politics, The University of Adelaide, South Australia 5005

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881465737?accountid=14925

Abstract: Due to the difficulties involved in obtaining data, especially on a nation-wide basis, statistical studies of domestic violence have been limited. This is particularly true for developing countries, including India, where gender discrimination is deeply entrenched. This study draws on data from one of the only current sources of nationwide information about domestic violence in India, the Indian National Crime Records Bureau. To examine the general patterns in domestic crimes against women across India, multivariate linear regression is performed on Dowry Death (wife murder) and Cruelty (wife abuse) crime rates for the major Indian states and cities. The primary findings reveal a robust inverse relationship between Dowry Death crimes and a state's level of development, and suggest a possible link between development and other domestic violence. Specifically, the urban-rural disparities in the Cruelty data are explained with a "gendered resource theory" hypothesis that wife-abuse is more prevalent in areas of higher social development change (such as changing gender roles). The paper discusses these results within an ecological domestic violence paradigm, and addresses the inherent complications with using crime data. Adapted from the source document.

The Young Parenthood Program: Preventing Intimate Partner Violence Between Adolescent Mothers and Young Fathers

Author: Florsheim, Paul1; McArthur, Laura; Hudak, Cristina; Heavin, Sarah; Burrow-Sanchez, Jason1 UWM School of Public Health, 1020 N. 12th Street, Suite 4180, Milwaukee, WI 53233, USA paulf@uwm.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964195579?accountid=14925

Abstract: This pilot study tested the Young Parenthood Program (YPP), which is a new coparenting counseling program designed to support positive communications and prevent the occurrence of intimate partner violence (IPV) among pregnant adolescents and their biological partners. One hundred five coparenting couples were recruited, assessed, and randomized into a treatment or a control group and then reassessed at 3 and 18 months post birth. The assessment process included an interview-based screening for the occurrence of IPV that was administered to both mothers and fathers in individual meetings. Initial results indicated that couples who were randomly assigned to the YPP were significantly less likely to have engaged in IPV at the first follow-up, compared to couples in the "treatment as usual" control group, but the strength of this finding diminished over time. Because the YPP is new and our sample is relatively small, findings should be regarded as preliminary. Additional testing of YPP is necessary, but initial results are promising and underscore the potential value of targeted programs for preventing IPV among at-risk populations. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Between Unmarried Parents Before and During Participation in a Couple and Relationship Education Program

Author: Wilde, Jason L1; Doherty, William J1 Dept. of Family Social Science, University of Minnesota, 290 McNeal Hall, 1985 Buford Ave., St. Paul, MN 55108, USA jwilde@umn.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964195586?accountid=14925

Abstract: Concerns have been raised that relationship education with couples who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) may set off further violence as the couple works through relationship issues. This is one of the first empirical research studies to address whether couples who have experienced IPV prior to enrollment have an elevated risk of violence during a couple education program. Data are from the Family Formation Project, a federally funded Healthy Marriage Initiative working with urban, low-income, unmarried parent couples (N = 90), of whom 44% reported IPV prior to enrollment. We present our IPV screening protocol and illustrate the types of violence found at enrollment. Of note is that no cases of "intimate terrorism"-the most serious controlling violence-were found in this sample. Findings for increased risk for IPV showed no statistically significant elevated risk during the program among those with prior IPV experience. However, sample size and other methodological limitations suggest that the "no elevated risk" finding be interpreted with caution. Relationship education programs working with fragile family couples should be prepared to address violence in their programs. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence in Couples Seeking Relationship Education for the Transition to Parenthood

Author: Halford, W Kim1; Petch, Jemima; Greedy, Debra K; Gamble, Jenny1 Professor of Clinical Psychology, Director of Clinical Psychology Training Programs, School of Psychology Room 132, McElwain Building, University of Queensland, St. Lucia, QLD 4072, Australia

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a prevalent and common problem yet is rarely screened for, or addressed in, couple relationship education (CRE). The current study examined the prevalence of IPV in 250 couples expecting their first child who were recruited into a study of CRE across the transition to parenthood. The couples were generally highly satisfied with their relationship, yet 32% reported at least one incident of IPV in the past 12 months, and 7% reported that at least one spouse had been injured by IPV. The majority of violence was of low severity (pushing, slapping, or shoving), and the most common pattern was of reciprocal aggression between the partners. Given that even low-severity IPV is associated with significant risk of injury and predicts risk of relationship separation, these high rates of IPV are concerning. CRE providers for expectant couples need to attend to prevention of IPV within their programs. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence in a Statewide Couple and Relationship Education Initiative

Author: Bradford, Kay1; Skogrand, Linda; Higginbotham, Brian J1 Department of Family, Consumer, and Human Development, Utah State University, 2705 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322-2705, USA k.bradford@usu.edu

Abstract: As couple and relationship education (CRE) has become an increasingly common intervention, issues surrounding the awareness, prevention, and treatment of violence have been raised. Concerns include the level of risk among participants, appropriate training for educators, and the extent to which CRE increases or mitigates risks for intimate partner violence (IPV). This study reports the level of risk among CRE participants and explores the associated experiences of county Cooperative Extension agents who served as the CRE educators in Utah. The educators presumed those interested in CRE would not be experiencing IPV. However, 10% of CRE participants indicated moderate-to-severe risk, and an additional 29% indicated likelihood of at least mild violence. Implications include the need for CRE initiatives to (a) take the possibility of IPV seriously, (b) train educators to identify and handle diverse types of IPV, and (c) monitor the implementation of IPV protocols. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Relationship aggression has negative effects on adults, children, and society. In this article, we outline the potential benefits of using relationship education programs that are designed for and delivered to individuals (rather than couples) for preventing relationship aggression. Next, we briefly review one such program, Within My Reach, and related research on its effectiveness in preventing relationship aggression. Implications of this research for future research, clinical practice, and policy are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Control Scale: Development and Initial Testing

Author: Bledsoe, Linda K1; Sar, Bibhuti K1 Kent School of Social Work, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, 40292, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896186700?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although control has long been considered central to understanding intimate partner violence (IPV), there continues to be a notable lack of validated scales measuring control (e.g., Strauchler et al. Journal of Family Violence, 19(6), 339-354, 2004). The purpose of this study was to develop and empirically validate a brief assessment tool, the Intimate Partner Violence Control Scale (IPVCS), designed to measure control in the context of IPV. Data from a sample of male undergraduate and graduate students (n=436) were used to examine the scale's properties. After reviewing theoretical conceptualizations and measurement issues of control, psychometric properties of the IPVCS and results of exploratory hypotheses tests are presented. The availability of a brief and reliable measure of control offers a tool for professionals in the judicial system, for IPV victims' advocates, and for human services workers in practice settings to adequately assess for control and fills a gap in this area of research and practice.

Abstract: Women reported to child protective service agencies frequently report problems that significantly interfere with the health and well-being of their children and themselves. Behavioral treatment programs appear to be effective in managing these co-existing problems, such as domestic violence and substance abuse. However, evidence-supported interventions are rarely exemplified in complicated clinical cases, especially within child welfare settings. Therefore, in this case example, we describe the process of adapting an evidence-supported treatment to assist in managing significant co-existing health-related problems in a mother who was referred due to child neglect and drug abuse. At the conclusion of therapy, the participant reported improvements in perceived family relationships, illicit drug use, child maltreatment potential, whereas other health-related outcomes were mixed. Most improvements were maintained at 4-month follow-up. Issues relevant to implementing evidence-based treatments within community contexts are discussed, including methods of increasing the likelihood of valid outcome assessment, managing treatment integrity, and adjusting standardized treatments to accommodate co-occurring problems. This research was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (1R01DA020548-01A1) awarded to Brad Donohue. The authors wish to thank Sally K. Miller, PhD, APN, FAANP and Associate Professor, UNLV School of Nursing for her work in completing the initial in-home health evaluation/physical for the current project.

Interventions for Intimate Partner Violence: A Historical Review

Author: Barner, John R1; Carney, Michelle Mohr1 University of Georgia School of Social Work, Tucker Hall, Athens, GA, 30602, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896186770?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV), also known as domestic abuse or relationship violence, has generated a large research literature for the last half-century, particularly in the areas of criminal justice, psychology, and the social sciences. Interventions for victims and perpetrators of IPV have largely been sequestered to separately evolving efforts of law enforcement and the psychotherapeutic community (Chang et al. Women's Health Issues, 15(1), 21-30, 2005; Dalton Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment & Trauma, 15(1), 59-75, 2007; Dobash and Dobash 2000; Feder et al. 2008; Gerbert et al. Journal of Family Practice, 49(10), 889-895, 2000; Wathen and MacMillan. Journal of the American Medical Association, 289(5), 589-600, 2003). This article presents a brief overview of the historical evolution and development of these discrete perspectives and identifies and assesses current collaborative interventions rooted in these historical precedents. In conclusion, the authors provide a summative discussion of the most current findings of research into IPV interventions, with a particular focus on the changing roles of race and gender in both the criminal prosecution of IPV and services provided to IPV perpetrators and victims.

Straighten Up and Act Like a Lady: A Qualitative Study of Lesbian Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Walters, Mikel L11 Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1125223140?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although scholars have been studying domestic violence for decades now, it is only recently that domestic violence occurring in non-heterosexual relationships has received noteworthy attention. Several researchers have called for further study of lesbian intimate partner violence (IPV) and the experiences of lesbian survivors. This exploratory study was designed to uncover the experiences of lesbian survivors in regards to their background of violence, perception of lesbian community attitudes, and experience with seeking help. Using modified grounded theory, I was able to expose several recurring themes in the data, including the following: history of violence; gendered belief of violence; the reality of lesbian intimate partner violence; help seeking and the silence surrounding lesbian intimate partner violence in the lesbian community; and the roles of homophobia and heterosexism in lesbian intimate partner violence. Survivors repeatedly reported feeling silenced, isolated, and helpless due to the lack of acknowledgment of and support for lesbian survivors of intimate partner violence in their communities. The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of women who have endured violence at the hands of their same-sex intimate partners. Adapted from the source document.

Unintended Pregnancy and Intimate Partner Violence Before and During Pregnancy Among Latina Women in Los Angeles, California

Author: Martin, Kathryn R1; Garcia, Lorena1 University of California, Los Angeles krmartin@ucla.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896166809?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this paper was to examine the relationship between unintended pregnancy and intimate partner violence (IPV) before and during pregnancy among Latinas. A cross-sectional interview measuring pregnancy intent, IPV, and acculturation, using the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans (ARSMA-II), was conducted among Latina women in their 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy at clinics in Los Angeles (n = 313). Overall, 44% of women reported an unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of physical (any) and emotional (only) abuse 12 months before pregnancy was 11% and 22%, respectively. Although both types of IPV decreased during pregnancy (10% and 19%, respectively), most reports of physical IPV during pregnancy (53%) were among women who did not report physical abuse before pregnancy. After adjusting for other factors, physical IPV before pregnancy was not associated with unintended pregnancy (adjusted OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.40, 2.16). The prevalence of unintended pregnancy was highest (76%) among highly acculturated Latinas. However, when an unintended pregnancy occurred among less acculturated Latinas, who comprised the majority of the sample (n = 270), it was associated with greater risk of physical IPV during pregnancy (unadjusted OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.06, 6.23); although the confidence interval included one after adjusting for other factors (adjusted OR = 2.79; 95% CI = 0.98, 7.92). An unintended pregnancy may have a unique impact on relationships in the context of Latino culture, where family and pregnancy are highly valued. Pregnancy often creates an opportunity for providers to discuss issues related to abuse and family planning with women who do not regularly access care. The results from this study may be used to increase the cultural sensitivity with which violence and reproductive health are addressed among the diverse population of Latinas when they connect with prenatal services.

Intimate Partner Violence Within Law Enforcement Families

Author: Anderson, Anita S1; Lo, Celia C1 University of Alabama

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896166814?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using data from the Baltimore Police Stress and Domestic Violence study, the authors examined how exposure to stressful events on the job affects law enforcement employees' physical aggression toward domestic partners, evaluating the role of negative emotions and authoritarian spillover in mediating the impact of such task-related stress. The authors consulted general strain theory and angry aggression theory to explain domestic violence in police families. Significant positive effects on physical aggression toward an intimate partner were found for variables measuring authoritarian spillover and negative emotions. However, these effects were different for different gender and racial groups. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Degree of Exposure to Domestic Violence, Psychopathology, and Functional Impairment in Children and Adolescents

Author: Bayarri Fernandez, Eduard1; Ezpeleta, Lourdes; Granero, Roser; de la Osa, Nuria; Domenech, Josep Maria1 Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain eduard.bayarri@uab.cat

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896166823?accountid=14925

Abstract: There are discrepancies about whether children who witness and suffer domestic violence (DV) have similar outcomes in terms of psychopathology. This work examines the relationship between different types of exposure to DV and child psychopathology and functional impairment. One hundred and forty-four Spanish children aged from 4 to 17 years and exposed to DV were evaluated using a diagnostic interview and other instruments of psychopathology and functional impairment. The participants were classified in three groups according to the degree of exposure: witness (n = 72), involved (n = 52), and victim (n = 20). According to mothers' self-reports and mother-child combined information, DV equally affects psychopathology and functional impairment regardless of the degree of the exposure. Children's self-reports showed a linear trend to present greater psychopathology as a victim than as a witness. The differential effect of exposure to DV measured in this study depended on the informant, which underlines the importance of obtaining information from the children exposed to violence at home.

Dating Violence Perpetration and Victimization Among South Korean College Students: A Focus on Gender and Childhood Maltreatment

Author: Gover, Angela R1; Park, MiRang; Tomsich, Elizabeth A; Jennings, Wesley G1 University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO angela.gover@ucdenver.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896166827?accountid=14925

Abstract: Unlike the attention given to intimate partner violence among adolescents and young adults in western societies, dating violence is not currently recognized in South Korea as a social phenomenon in terms of research, prevention, and intervention. Childhood maltreatment has been identified in previous research as a risk factor for violence in a later dating relationship. This study examines the relationship between childhood maltreatment and physical and psychological dating violence perpetration and victimization among 1,399 college students in South Korea, with a specific focus on gender. Poisson regression models and tests of equivalent parameters were conducted to determine whether the observed relationships were invariant across gender. Findings indicated that childhood maltreatment is a consistent predictor of involvement in dating relationships characterized by violence for males and females. The implications of the current research within a cultural context are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Concurrent and Long-Term Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Employment Stability

Abstract: Previous research suggests that experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) may negatively affect employment outcomes. This study explores the relationship between IPV and employment stability both concurrently and longitudinally among a sample of 512 predominantly Asian American and Pacific Islander young women living in Hawaii. Women in this study were identified as being at risk of child maltreatment. About half of women indicated that their current relationship status was married or living together. More than two-thirds of women had graduated from high school and half had worked in the past year. The study explored the concurrent association of IPV and employment by assessing them simultaneously over a 12 month time period. The study examined the longitudinal impact of IPV by analyzing violence at two time points as predictors of unstable employment 6 to 8 years later. The study also explored the mediating effects of depression. Study results demonstrated both concurrent and longitudinal negative associations of IPV with employment stability. Women who experienced violence were more likely to be experiencing unstable employment concurrently. Women who experienced IPV at one point in time had lower levels of employment stability six years later. This decrease was partially mediated by experiencing depressive symptoms. Women who identified their primary ethnicity as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander were much more likely to experience unstable employment than Asian American women. More research is needed to explore the roles of mental health, race and ethnicity, and types of violence in the relationship between IPV and employment.

Risk Factors for Clinically Significant Intimate Partner Violence Among Active-Duty Members

Abstract: Hypothesized risk factors for men's and women's clinically significant intimate partner violence (CS-IPV) from four ecological levels (i.e., individual, family, workplace, community) were tested in a representative sample of active-duty U.S. Air Force members (N = 42,744). When considered together, we expected only individual and family factors to account for unique variance in CS-IPV perpetration. Hypothesized factors from all four ecological levels were related to men's CS-IPV perpetration bivariately, but, as expected, only individual and family factors accounted for unique variance across ecological levels. For women, only risk factors from the individual and family levels were significantly related to CS-IPV perpetration even bivariately. Results imply some what different risk profiles across gender and identify ecological risk factors of men's CS-IPV not previously studied. Adapted from the source document.

Representations of Domestic Violence in the Largest Circulating Newspaper from the Interior of Argentina

Author: Valdemarca, Laura1; Bonavitta, Paola1 Universidad Nacional de Cordoba E-mail: lauvaldemarca@arnet.com.ar

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/875716661?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article is a case study of how the most important newspaper from the interior of Argentina treats the issue of domestic violence. It is based on a study of primary sources and supported, methodologically, by discourse analysis. The discursive analysis of images related to domestic violence rests on the understanding that the media constructs social representations from a news-worthy criteria. We emphasize the ways in which such a construction supports various widely-entrenched beliefs, making it difficult for readers to go beyond the victim-perpetrator dichotomy and become committed to resolving this social problem. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate partner abuse and women's health in rural and mining communities

Author: Lockie, Stewart

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/886149340?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research examined the incidence and prevalence of male to female intimate partner abuse in the Bowen Basin region of Central Queensland. In particular, it was concerned to examine relationships between the incidence and prevalence of physical and non-physical abuse and rapid growth since 2004 of the regional mining industry. A telephone survey was conducted of 532 women resident either in the Bowen Basin or the nearby coastal city of Mackay, with a stratification strategy employed to ensure adequate numbers of women partnered to mine workers. The strongest covariates of all forms of intimate partner abuse were other forms of intimate partner abuse. Some relationships were also evident between involvement in mining or residence in a mining town and other forms of abuse. However, more consistent risk factors included drug and alcohol use, partner education, partner smoking habits, age, relationship status and debt. The research suggest that any direct influence of mining cultures and workforce management practices on the incidence or prevalence of intimate partner abuse is limited, but that substantial population growth stimulated by mining activity-coupled with serious negative mental health outcomes for women subjected to abuse- presents a compelling case for the expansion of specialist support services.

The Long Arc of Recovery: Characterizing Intimate Partner Violence and Its Psychosocial Effects Across 17 Years

Author: Lindhorst, Taryn1; Beadnell, Blair1 University of Washington, Seattle, WA tarynlin@u.washington.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896184211?accountid=14925

Abstract: Little is known about how intimate partner violence (IPV) affects women's long-term mental health. Using 17 years of data from adolescent mothers, this study (a) empirically identified three subgroups based on patterns of IPV exposure during 4 years of their adolescence; (b) found that subgroup membership was a predictor of psychosocial outcomes in the subsequent 13 years, and (c) showed that the long-term effects of IPV exposure persisted even while controlling for the role of early poverty. By their 30s, women had recovered from IPV such that there were no significant differences between groups at the final time point.

Intimate Partner Violence and HIV Risk Behaviors Among Socially Disadvantaged Chilean Women

Author: Miner, Sarah1; Ferrer, Lilian; Cianelli, Rosina; Bernales, Margarita; Cabieses, Baltica1 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, minersarah@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/886047442?accountid=14925

Abstract: The objective of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between intimate partner v iolence (IPV) and HIV risk among socioeconomically disadvantaged Chilean women. A correlational analysis with data from the NIH-funded project, "Testing an HIV/AIDS Prevention Intervention for Chilean Women," was conducted. Two hundred and sixty-one women were included in this analysis (n = 261). Those women who had experienced any type of IPV in the past 3 months had significantly higher risk for HIV than those who had not (t = -2.016, p < .05). Also a linear trend was found among those women who had experienced more than one type of IPV in the past 3 months and HIV risk.

Understanding Self-Harm in Victims of Intimate Partner Violence: A Qualitative Analysis of Calls Made by Victims to a Crisis Hotline in China

Author: Wong, Susan PY1; Wang, Cuiling; Meng, Mei; Phillips, Michael R1 Beijing Hui Long Guan Hospital, Beijing, China, susanpywong@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/886051044?accountid=14925

Abstract: Text analysis of the transcripts of 26 calls made to a Chinese crisis hotline by victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) reporting thoughts or acts of self-harm abstracted information on victims' patterns of self-harm and the relationship of their self-harm to IPV. Specific violent episodes often triggered self-harm. Victims considered self-harm a method for airing painful emotions caused by abuse or as a last resort to escape by dying when they saw no other options and were no longer able to endure the violence. We also elaborate on callers' discussions of barriers to accessing support, sociocultural pressures to preserve "face" and family, and restrictive gender roles that contribute to their self-harm behaviors.

Abstract: There has been a decidedly different social response to the abuse of a child and the abuse of an intimate partner, although both forms of violence occur within the family. This article explains the differential response to these forms of family violence through a historical examination of the movements to combat child abuse and intimate partner violence, including the influence of first- and second-wave feminism. The author applies theories of social control to analyze the development of the social response. She argues that an integration of the social service and criminal justice systems would best serve families who are experiencing violence.

A Matter of Life and Death: The Voices of Domestic Violence Survivors

Author: Zosky, Diane11 School of Social Work, Illinois State University, Normal, IL, USA dlzosky@ilstu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896204750?accountid=14925

Abstract: In light of recent threats to funding for essential services, this qualitative study asked women survivors of domestic violence what they would do if their current services were no longer available. The themes seemed to span a continuum of resilience, from continuing to look for a way to escape the abuse, to uncertainty, to hopelessness and fear, and to resignation by staying in the abusive relationship. The majority of women reported that if domestic violence services were not available, they would remain with their abusers with dramatically negative consequences.

The (in)visibility of psychological family violence in childhood and adolescence

Author: de Abranches, Cecy Dunshee1; de Assis, Simone Goncalves1 Instituto Fernandes Fiueira, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz. Av. Rui Barbosa 716, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 22250-020, Brasil

Abstract: Psychological family violence in childhood and adolescence is still poorly studied, due to difficulties in its definition and detection. This article aims to examine how psychological family violence reported by children and adolescents has been addressed in academic studies, using a literature review (LILACS, MEDLINE, SciELO, PubMed, CAPES Portal, PsycINFO, and SCOPUS databases). Among 51 epidemiological studies, 16 articles met the review's objectives; some of the articles reported a high prevalence of such violence. The study showed that the issue has been studied more in the international literature than in Brazil, which has significantly increased its visibility in the last decade but still faces difficulties involving definition, conceptualization, and operationalization. Eliminating the invisibility of psychological violence in the family could help promote prevention of such violence and protection of children and adolescents. Adapted from the source document.

'Suffering in a silent vacuum': Woman-to-woman partner abuse as a challenge to the lesbian feminist vision

Author: Barnes, Rebecca11 University of Derby, UK R.Barnes@derby.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896184772?accountid=14925

Abstract: This reflection addresses the challenge which violence and abuse in women's same-sex relationships pose to lesbian feminist conceptualizations of woman-to-woman relationships as egalitarian and non-violent. Whilst recognizing the value of the ideals which lesbian feminism promoted in terms of presenting an alternative to patriarchal oppression and domination, this reflection draws upon data from the author's qualitative study of woman-to-woman partner abuse to identify the implications of such ideals for women's disclosure of and understanding of their experiences of abuse. For some participants, the pervasiveness of expectations of mutuality and non-violence in woman-to-woman relationships contributed to the silence and denial which surrounds woman-to-woman partner abuse. In spite of this, this reflection maintains that there is still scope for lesbian feminism to make a positive contribution towards promoting democratic, egalitarian, and non-abusive relationships. In order for this to be possible however, lesbian feminist thinking must first develop a more inclusive understanding of woman-to-woman relationships which confronts the reality that some women's experiences of woman-to-woman relationships run contrary to the longed-for lesbian utopia which was central to 1970s lesbian feminist ideals.

The Identification of Implicit Theories in Domestic Violence Perpetrators

Author: Dempsey, Bernadette1; Day, Andrew1 University of South Australia, Magill, Adelaide, andrew.day@deakin.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/886056257?accountid=14925

Abstract: An understanding of how the beliefs of domestically violent offenders might influence their abusive behavior is central to the development and delivery of any intervention program that aims to reduce the risk of further violence against women and children. This article reports the results of a preliminary investigation into the core beliefs of a sample of domestically violent men. Three major themes emerged from an analysis of the accounts of their violence, which were understood in relation to three implicit theories that participants held about themselves, their relationships, and the world. These are discussed in terms of previous studies of offender cognition, how domestic violence programs might be conceptualized, and their implications for practice.

The Development of an Evidence Based Assessment Protocol for Intimate Partner Violence in the U.S. Army

Author: Forgey, Mary Ann1; Badger, Lee; Krase, Kathryn1 Graduate School of Social Service, Fordham University, 113 West 60th St., New York, NY 10023

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/907929669?accountid=14925

Abstract: The importance of conducting evidence based assessment has been widely acknowledged by many professions, including social work. In this study, the U.S. Army, in partnership with university researchers, developed an evidence based assessment protocol to assist the individual social worker in conducting his/her assessment of intimate partner violence. The protocol development process involved posing answerable research questions about intimate partner violence assessment content and method and then adhering to the steps of evidence based practice to answer those questions. Key to the protocol development process was the partnership created between researchers and practitioners as part of an expert panel. Adapted from the source document.

Co-Occurrence of Intimate Partner Violence and Child Abuse in Hong Kong Chinese Families

Author: Chan, Ko Ling11 University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China eklchan@hkucc.hku.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896180730?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the prevalence of co-occurrence of intimate partner violence (IPV) and child abuse and neglect (CAN) in a cohort of Chinese parents drawn from a large representative sample in Hong Kong. It also investigates the risk factors for CAN with a special emphasis on the role of IPV. A subsample of 2,363 parents was invited to complete the Conflict Tactics Scale and a demographic questionnaire examining the risk factors for CAN. Results show that among the perpetrators of child maltreatment, 37% and 36%, respectively, admitted they had been perpetrators and victims of IPV over their lifetime. Physical and psychological violence between spouses were the characteristics most significantly associated with child maltreatment. This suggests that intervention for CAN should include an assessment of IPV history. Integrative treatment for children suffering from CAN and interparental violence may be considered in intervention programs to combat CAN and IPV.

Cultural Barriers to Help-Seeking Among Taiwanese Female Victims of Dating Violence

Author: Shen, April Chiung-Tao11 National Taiwan University, Taipei, Republic of China acshen@ntu.edu.tw

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896180742?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents a qualitative analysis regarding the help-seeking behaviors of female dating-violence victims from a cultural perspective. A semistructured, in-depth interview was used to collect data from 10 female victims (aged 20-28). Findings indicate that Taiwanese dating-violence victims tend to seek informal help rather than formal help. Culturally structured help-seeking experiences center around six primary themes: (a) self-reliant culture, (b) personal and family shame, (c) secretive and sexual dating relationships, (d) fear of negative reactions from others, (e) unfamiliarity with available resources, and (f) revictimization in seeking help. Understanding cultural meanings and barriers encountered in help-seeking behaviors is an important step in effectively assisting victims of dating violence.

Why Doesn't He Leave? Relationship Continuity and Satisfaction Among Male Domestic Violence Offenders

Author: Henning, Kris1; Connor-Smith, Jennifer1 Portland State University, Portland, OR khenning@pdx.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896180756?accountid=14925

Abstract: In contrast to the extensive literature on women's decisions to leave violent relationships, there is little research examining relationship continuity from the offending male's perspective. Similarly, research exploring relationship satisfaction in men arrested for intimate partner violence (IPV) is lacking, despite the fact that dissatisfaction appears to increase risk for future IPV. The present study explored these issues using a large sample of men who were recently convicted of violence toward a female intimate partner (N = 1,130). More than half of the men (59%) reported that they were continuing or planning to continue their relationship. Factors associated with relationship continuity included older age, being married to the victim, having children together, attributing less blame to the victim for the recent offense, and having a childhood history of family violence. Among men who were continuing their relationship, low relationship satisfaction was predicted by having children, expressing hostile attitudes toward women, being jealous, blaming the victim for the arrest incident, and describing the victim as aggressive. Implications of the findings for clinical practice and research are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Controlling for Selection Effects in the Relationship Between Child Behavior Problems and Exposure to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Emery, Clifton R11 Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea cemery@yonsei.ac.kr

Abstract: This article used the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) data to examine the relationship between exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) and child behavior problems (externalizing and internalizing), truancy, grade repetition, smoking, drinking, and use of marijuana. Longitudinal data analysis was conducted on 1,816 primary caregivers and their children. Fixed-effects regression models were employed to address concerns with selection bias. IPV was associated with significantly greater internalizing behavior, externalizing behavior, and truancy. Findings from age interaction models suggested that the relationship between IPV and child behavior problems may attenuate as the age of the child at time of exposure increases.

Sex Disparities in Arrest Outcomes for Domestic Violence

Author: Hamilton, Melissa1; Worthen, Meredith G F1 University of Toledo College of Law, Toledo, OH mhamiltonp@att.net

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902082636?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence arrests have been historically focused on protecting women and children from abusive men. Arrest patterns continue to reflect this bias with more men arrested for domestic violence compared to women. Such potential gender variations in arrest patterns pave the way to the investigation of disparities by sex of the offender in domestic violence arrests. This study utilizes data from a quantitative dataset that includes responses by police officers who completed a specially mandated checklist after responding to a domestic dispute. The results showed that while females are arrested quite often in domestic disputes, there remains a significant difference in the arrest outcome whereby male suspects were more likely to be arrested than female suspects. Regression models further indicated differences based on sex and certain predictors of arrest, which supported sex-based rationales in arrests for domestic violence.

Psychosocial Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence for Women and Men in Canada

Author: Ansara, Donna L1; Hindin, Michelle J1 Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD dansara@jhsph.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902072425?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although the negative health consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) are well documented, most research has conceptualized IPV as a unitary construct and has primarily focused on the impact of physical violence. However, recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that IPV may be heterogeneous, with different consequences associated with different patterns of violence, abuse, and control. This study used latent class analysis to examine the psychosocial consequences associated with different patterns of physical violence, sexual coercion, psychological abuse, and controlling behavior. Data from 676 women and 455 men who were interviewed for the 2004 Canadian General Social Survey on Victimization were analyzed. The results suggest that experiencing any pattern of violence is associated with a range of negative psychosocial outcomes for both women and men. However, they also show the increasingly negative impact and perceived dangerousness of IPV for those experiencing more severe and chronic patterns of violence and control. These findings were particularly pronounced for women as they experienced the most chronic pattern of abuse and control documented in the study. The psychosocial consequences were also greater for women than for men with similar experiences of IPV. These results suggest that the psychosocial impact of IPV is influenced by gender and by the nature of the violence, abuse, and control experienced.

Traditional Male Ideology and Service System Involvement Among Drug-Involved Men Who Perpetrate Intimate Partner Violence: A Longitudinal Study

Author: Wu, Elwin1; El-Bassel, Nabila; Gilbert, Louisa; O'Connor, Meghan; Seewald, Randy1 Columbia University School of Social Work, New York

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902077059?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to examine the extent to which drug-involved men who perpetrate male-to-female intimate partner violence (IPV) are engaged with various formal service systems as well as whether adherence to traditional male ideologies-thought to drive perpetration of male-to-female IPV-affects help-seeking behavior. This study also seeks to redress a gap in the research literature stemming from the general reliance on batterers intervention programs to acquire samples of IPV perpetrators. A sample of 126 men receiving methadone maintenance treatment who reported perpetrating IPV against a female partner participated in this longitudinal study. A large majority (88%) of participants reported use of additional services beyond methadone treatment (e.g., medical, employment/ vocational, etc.). Using generalized linear modeling, we found that greater endorsement of traditional male ideologies significantly predicted lower subsequent service utilization overall, except for legal services, for which there was a significant positive association. These findings suggest targeted assessment and engagement strategies may be required to involve a greater number of drug-involved men who perpetrate IPV with a wider spectrum of health and social services.

Custody Evaluators' Beliefs About Domestic Violence Allegations During Divorce: Feminist and Family Violence Perspectives

Author: Haselschwerdt, Megan L1; Hardesty, Jennifer L; Hans, Jason D1 University of Illinois, Urbana

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902077085?accountid=14925

Abstract: Approximately, 20% of divorcing couples in the United States require judicial intervention to reach a custody agreement. In such cases, courts often call on child custody evaluators to conduct comprehensive evaluations and recommend custody agreements and services that meet children's best interests. Estimates suggest that allegations of domestic violence (DV) are raised and substantiated in about 75% of these cases. Custody evaluators are thus in a position to ensure that divorcing parents with DV receive effective services and enter into safe custody agreements. They are also in a position to minimize or deny the seriousness of DV and its relevance to custody decisions. The present study uses grounded theory methods to examine how custody evaluators' theoretical perspectives on DV and beliefs about custody disputes in the context of DV are related to their evaluation process and recommendations.

Impacts of domestic violence on child growth and nutrition: A conceptual review of the pathways of influence

Author: Yount, Kathryn M1; DiGirolamo, Ann M; Ramakrishnan, Usha1 Hubert Department of Global Health, Department of Sociology, Emory University, 1518 Clifton Rd. NE, Room 7029, Atlanta, GA 30322, United States kyount@sph.emory.edu

Abstract: Domestic violence against women is a global problem, and young children are disproportionate witnesses. Children's exposure to domestic violence (CEDV) predicts poorer health and development, but its effects on nutrition and growth are understudied. We propose a conceptual framework for the pathways by which domestic violence against mothers may impair child growth and nutrition, prenatally and during the first 36 months of life. We synthesize literatures from multiple disciplines and critically review the evidence for each pathway. Our review exposes gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. The framework also identifies interim strategies to mitigate the effects of CEDV on child growth and nutrition. Given the global burden of child malnutrition and its long-term effects on human-capital formation, improving child growth and nutrition may be another reason to prevent domestic violence and its cascading after-effects.

Response effects to attitudinal questions about domestic violence against women: A comparative perspective

Author: Yount, Kathryn M1; Halim, Nafisa; Hynes, Michelle; Hillman, Emily R1 Hubert Department of Global Health, Emory University, 1518 Clifton Rd NE, Room 7029, Atlanta, GA 30322, United States kyount@sph.emory.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887498568?accountid=14925

Abstract: According to the national Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), between 10% and 90% of women in poorer countries agree that domestic violence against women is justified. Such wide variation in women's responses raises concerns about the comparability of the underlying attitudinal question, and the validity of comparative research that assumes comparability. Using 67 DHS conducted in 48 countries between 1995 and 2007, we explored whether cross-national variation in women's affirmative responses to this question were explained by cross-national variation in survey design, socioeconomic conditions, or both. Variation in survey design had considerable predictive power and accounted for a non-trivial amount of the variance in women's affirmative responses. Including the survey-design variables also modestly altered associations of the outcome with structural variables of interest in comparative studies. These findings offer insights about future analyses and data collections on women's attitudes about domestic violence against women. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

Abstract: This study examines the impact of comprehensive services on posttreatment substance use among women with a history of intimate partner violence. The sample includes 1,123 women from 50 treatment facilities derived from the National Treatment Improvement Evaluation Study (NTIES). Generalized linear mixed modeling was used to determine whether a history of intimate partner violence moderates the association between service receipt and posttreatment substance use. Significant interactions were found between history of intimate partner violence and concrete ( p = .016) and family services (p = .023) in predicting substance use.

Law Enforcement Officers' Attitudes About Domestic Violence

Author: Gover, Angela R1; Pudrzynska Paul, Dagmar; Dodge, Mary1 University of Colorado Denver, angela.gover@ucdenver.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/886048634?accountid=14925

Abstract: This exploratory study examines attitudes about domestic violence among officers from a large urban police department. Additionally, this study examines whether attitudes vary according to officer characteristics. A total of 309 police officers responded to a survey that explored their attitudes and perceptions of domestic violence incidents. The results show that officers are well versed in handling domestic violence, though self-reports indicate that police personnel who respond to the calls are concerned about their limited amount of discretion. Additionally, when comparing attitudes based on officer characteristics, more similarities are found than differences. Implications for future research are discussed.

Organizational Impacts on the Secondary Traumatic Stress of Social Workers Assisting Family Violence or Sexual Assault Survivors

Author: Choi, Ga-Young11 Department of Social Work, University of Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls, IA 50614-0405, USA gayoung.choi@uni.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/907928984?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research examines the influence of organizational characteristics on secondary traumatic stress of social workers who provide direct services to survivors of family violence or sexual assault. The sample (n = 154) was recruited through the National Association of Social Workers' member list, The study found that social workers who received more support from their coworkers, supervisors, and work teams demonstrated lower levels of secondary traumatic stress. Social workers who also had more access to their organizations' strategic information exhibited lower levels of secondary traumatic stress. Several implications for social work administrators are suggested based on the findings. Adapted from the source document.

The Impact of Neighborhood Factors on the Well-Being of Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence Over Time

Author: Beeble, Marisa L1; Sullivan, Cris M; Bybee, Deborah1 Department of Psychology, The Sage Colleges, Rathbone Hall, 140 New Scotland Avenue, Albany, NY, 12208, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417523954?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive social problem impacting the psychological well-being of millions of US women annually. The extant literature draws our attention to the devastating mental health effects of IPV, but largely overlooks how ecological factors may further explain survivors' well-being. This study examined how neighborhood disadvantage may contribute to survivors' compromised well-being, in addition to the abuse women experienced. Neighborhood disorder and fear of victimization significantly impacted survivors' well-being, over and above abuse. Although between-women effects of neighborhood disorder and fear were unrelated to change in women's depression or quality of life (QOL), significant within-woman effects were detected. Change in neighborhood disorder was negatively associated with change in QOL, and this relationship was fully mediated by fear. While no direct relationship between change in neighborhood disorder and depression was detected, an indirect effect through survivors' fear was revealed. Implications for future research and practice are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Assessing the Overlap in Dating Violence Perpetration and Victimization among South Korean College Students: The Influence of Social Learning and Self-Control

Author: Jennings, Wesley G1; Park, MiRang; Tomsich, Elizabeth A; Gover, Angela R; Akers, Ronald L1 College of Behavioral and Community Sciences, Department of Criminology, University of South Florida, 4202 E. Fowler Ave., SOC 326, Tampa, FL, 33620, USA jenningswgj@usf.edu

Abstract: Research has recently begun to identify an overlap of involvement in offending and victimization and a shared commonality of risk factors for both outcomes. Despite this growing body of evidence, this research has yet to have been extended to dating violence in general and in cross cultural samples specifically. Recognizing these gaps in the literature, the current study examines the correlation between psychological and physical dating violence perpetration and victimization among a large sample of South Korean college students. Results from a series of bivariate probit models suggest that there is a strong degree of overlap between dating violence perpetration and victimization and that social learning theory and self-control theory cannot explain away the overlap. Study limitations and implications are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Among Men Having Sex with Men, Women, or Both: Early-Life Sexual and Physical Abuse as Antecedents

Author: Welles, Seth L1; Corbin, Theodore J; Rich, John A; Reed, Elizabeth; Raj, Anita1 Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Drexel School of Public Health, Philadelphia, PA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887495755?accountid=14925

Abstract: Little is known about the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) among men who have sex with men (MSM) or about childhood adversity as a predictor of IPV among MSM. Studies have documented high rates of childhood sexual abuse among MSM. To evaluate associations of early-life sexual and physical abuse with IPV among African American heterosexual men or MSM, prevalence of early-life (<=21years) sexual and physical abuse was measured among 703 nonmonogamous African American men. Men were classified as (1) MSM who disclosed male sex partners; (2) MSM who initially denied male sex partners but subsequently reported oral-genital and anal-genital behaviors with men; (3) non-MSM. MSM who initially disclosed male sex partners reported significantly (P<0.0001) higher rates of early physical abuse (36%) and lifetime abuse (49%) compared with non-MSM (15 and 22%), respectively. These MSM reported significantly higher rates of sexual abuse by age 11, age 21, and over a lifetime compared with non-MSM (P<0.0001). Being an MSM who initially disclosed male sex partners (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.2, 3.6) and early-life sexual abuse (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.8, 4.3) was associated with IPV victimization in current relationships. Similarly, being an MSM with early-life physical and sexual abuse was associated (0.0004<=P<=&# x00A0;0.07) with IPV perpetration. Early-life physical and sexual abuse was higher among MSM who disclosed male sex partners compared with heterosexual men; however, all MSM who experienced early-life abuse were more likely to be IPV victims or perpetrators. Adapted from the source document.

Understanding Gender and Domestic Violence From a Sample of Married Women in Urban Thailand

Author: Xu, Xiaohe1; Kerley, Kent R; Sirisunyaluck, Bangon1 University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA xiaohe.xu@utsa.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896194451?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is a widespread agreement among gender and family violence investigators that gender and socioeconomic inequalities play key roles in domestic violence against women (DVAW). By integrating the concepts of gender traditionalism and decision-making power into a variety of resource-based theories, this study develops a gender perspective to explore the linkages between gendered correlates and psychological and physical DVAW in urban Thailand. Based on a random sample of 770 married women in Bangkok, results from our Tobit regression models indicate that when Thai wives accept gender traditionalism, have significantly greater or smaller economic resources than their husbands, or have significantly greater or smaller decision-making power, they are at greater risk for multiple forms of domestic violence. However, contrary to expectations, Thai wives who report higher levels of social contact or integration do not experience less domestic violence. It is concluded that gender egalitarianism in urban Thailand can greatly reduce the risk of DVAW. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Coexisting difficulties and couple therapy outcomes: Psychopathology and intimate partner violence.

Author: Rowe, Lorelei Simpson1; Doss, Brian D; Hsueh, Annie C; Libet, Julian; Mitchell, Alexandra E1 Department of Psychology, Southern Methodist University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023027644?accountid=14925

Abstract: Couples presenting for treatment of relationship distress often experience additional problems, including individual psychopathology and intimate partner violence (IPV). Both issues are associated with current and future poor relationship functioning in nontreatment samples, but relatively little is understood about their association with initial presentation and outcomes in couple therapy. The current study examined these associations in a sample of 177 heterosexual couples who received therapy at two Veteran's Affairs clinics. Unlike most studies of couple therapy outcomes, couples were not excluded from treatment specifically because of high levels of psychopathology or IPV. Results of Actor Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) analyses revealed actor and partner effects of depression, actor effects of anxiety, and partner effects of IPV on initial relationship satisfaction, such that greater coexisting difficulties were associated with poorer initial satisfaction. However, improvement in relationship satisfaction over the course of therapy was not associated with psychopathology, and, contrary to hypothesis, was positively associated with men's IPV prior to treatment, even when initial level of satisfaction was controlled. The results suggest that coexisting symptoms of psychopathology or IPV may not necessarily interfere with therapy outcomes and, indeed, therapy may have positive effects for couples with these problems.

Mediators and Moderators of Change in Adjustment Following Intervention for Children Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Graham-Bermann, Sandra A1; Howell, Kathryn H; Lilly, Michelle; DeVoe, Ellen1 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896183500?accountid=14925

Abstract: Children aged 6 to 12 who were exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) within the last year participated in an intervention program found to be successful in reducing their internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. However, little is known about factors that may contribute to this efficacy. Both fixed and modifiable risk factors that predicted change in children's adjustment after the intervention were identified and tested. There was a significant relationship between the extent of exposure to IPV, gender, change in mothers' mental health, and change in child adjustment. Among fixed factors, length of exposure to violence was found to moderate the relationship between the amount of the child's and mother's participation in the intervention and change in child adjustment, specifically internalizing behavioral problems. Among the modifiable risk factors, change in mother's mental health, specifically symptoms of posttraumatic stress, was found to mediate the relationship between the amount of intervention participation and change in child adjustment. These findings can be used to inform and enhance evidence-based clinical services for children exposed to IPV. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Gender Differences in Depression and Anxiety Among Victims of Intimate Partner Violence: The Moderating Effect of Shame Proneness

Author: Shorey, Ryan C1; Sherman, Amanda E; Kivisto, Aaron J; Elkins, Sara R; Rhatigan, Deborah L; Moore, Todd M1 University of Tennessee, Knoxville rshorey@utk.edu

Abstract: The current study examined the moderating role of shame proneness on the association between physical, psychological, and sexual intimate partner violence victimization and depressive and anxious symptoms among male and female college students (N = 967). Students completed self-report measures of dating violence, depression, anxiety, and shame proneness. Results showed that shame proneness moderated the association between all forms of victimization and mental health symptoms. A three-way interaction revealed that sexual victimization predicted symptoms of anxiety to a greater extent for men than for women at high levels of shame proneness. Furthermore, results showed that gender moderated the association between physical and psychological victimization and health outcomes, such that victimization was related to increased depressive and anxious symptoms for men but not for women. Interpretations of these findings are discussed in relation to violence interventions, including primary prevention, and men's health.

Chinese and American college students' preferences for police response to domestic violence

Author: Sun, Ivan Y1; Li, Jessica C M; Wu, Yuning1 Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881469425?accountid=14925

Abstract: While a number of previous studies have examined citizens' attitudes towards police response to domestic violence, very few have approached the topic from an international, comparative perspective. Using survey data collected from more than 600 students in a Hong Kong university and an American university, this study empirically assesses students' attitudes towards proactive and reactive police responses to domestic violence incidents, controlling for students' demographic characteristics, personal and vicarious experiences with crime including domestic violence and perceptions of gender roles and violence. The results showed that Chinese students were less likely to support proactive police response and more likely to favour reactive police response, compared with their US counterparts. Chinese students' attitudes towards police response were shaped mainly by their attitudes towards gender equality, whereas American students' attitudes were influenced chiefly by their background characteristics and attitudes towards violence. Implications for policy and future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

"Whoa! They Could've Arrested Me!": Unsuccessful Identity Claims of Women During Police Response to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Leisenring, Amy11 Department of Sociology, One Washington Square, San Jose, CA, 95192-0122, USA amy.leisenring@sjsu.edu

Abstract: Many jurisdictions in the U.S. have implemented mandatory arrest policies in an attempt to limit police officers' discretion in their arrest decisions when responding to intimate partner violence calls. Drawing from semi-structured interviews with female victims of intimate partner violence, I explore the ways in which mandatory arrest policies have influenced the identity work of women during their interactions with police officers. I focus specifically on women's "unsuccessful" identity claims: situations where women are unable to convince police officers that they are victims and situations where women are unable to convince officers that they are not victims. I examine the strategies that women use during their identity work and explore the consequences of women's failed self presentations under mandatory arrest policies, the most significant of which is a woman's arrest. I argue that under mandatory arrest policies, for many women, the risk of failed identity work is even more consequential than before these policies were established.

Effects of Gender and Confrontation on Attributions of Female-Perpetrated Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Rhatigan, Deborah L; Stewart, Cindy; Moore, Todd M11 Department of Psychology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, 37996, USA, Tmoore24@utk.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/886141581?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study examined the effects of perpetrator gender, victim confrontation, observer gender, and observer exposure to violence on attributions of blame and responsibility for partner violence. Data were collected from 728 college-aged students enrolled at two southeastern universities in the United States. Results demonstrated gendered biases among both male and female respondents. Men and women attributed less responsibility and blame to female perpetrators than male perpetrators, especially if the perpetrator was provoked. Moreover, exposure to violence was important for predicting attributions, and some of the evidence for observer effects were reduced to non-significance once these variables were added to the model.

Sisterhood May Be Powerful for Reducing Sexual and Intimate Partner Violence: An Evaluation of the Bringing in the Bystander In-Person Program with Sorority Members

Author: Moynihan, Mary M1; Banyard, Victoria L; Arnold, Julie S; Eckstein, Robert P; Stapleton, Jane G1 University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA, marym@unh.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/886335640?accountid=14925

Abstract: Sorority members may be at greater risk than other college women for sexual violence and intimate partner violence (IPV). We evaluated the Bringing in the Bystander in-person program with sorority members who participated in the program (n = 30) compared with those who did not (n = 18). Results indicate that program participants showed increased bystander efficacy, likelihood to help, and responsibility for ending violence without unintended "backlash" effects. Implications include a call for future programming with more diverse sorority members over longer time. In addition, we discuss what the findings might mean for formal campus policies and practices for preventing sexual violence and IPV.

Differential effects of psychological maltreatment on children of mothers exposed to intimate partner violence

Author: de la Vega, Ariadna; de la Osa, Nuria; Ezpeleta, Lourdes; Granero, Roser; Domenech, Josep Maria

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/889673743?accountid=14925

Abstract: Psychological maltreatment (PM) is the most prevalent form of child abuse, and is the core component of most of what is considered as child maltreatment. The aim of this work was to explore differential adverse outcomes of the different types of PM in the mental health and functioning of children living in homes in which they are exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV). Participants were 168 children, aged between 4 and 17, whose mothers experienced IPV. They were assessed using different measures of psychopathology and functioning: Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-IV, Child Behavior Checklists and Child and Adolescent Functioning Assessment Scale. Furthermore, IPV was assessed with the Schedule for Assessment of Intimate Partner Violence Exposure in Children and the Index of Spouse Abuse. Statistical analyses were carried out with regression models adjusted by means of Generalized Estimating Equations. Spurning was the PM subtype with the greatest global effect on the children, as it was significantly associated with internalizing and externalizing problems. Denying emotional responsiveness specifically increased the risk of internalizing psychopathology and impairment in the emotional area. Terrorizing was not significantly associated with a greater number of negative outcomes in children's psychopathology or functioning in this population. The results suggest the importance of taking PM types into account in order to fully understand the problems of children exposed to IPV at home, and for the design of effective treatment and prevention programs.

Children exposed to child maltreatment and intimate partner violence: A study of co-occurrence among Hong Kong Chinese families

Author: Chan, Ko Ling

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/889632432?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study assessed the co-occurrence of child maltreatment and intimate partner violence (IPV) and examined the association between them. The cross-sectional study recruited a population-based sample of 1,094 children aged 12-17 years in Hong Kong. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data from the children. The prevalence of occurrence of child abuse and neglect by parents and exposure to IPV in both the past year and lifetime was examined, and their correlates were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The results show that 26% and 14.6% of child participants had been exposed to IPV physical assault, and 44.4% and 22.6% had been subjected to a parent's corporal punishment or to physical maltreatment from a parent in their lifetime and the year preceding the study, respectively. Among those families characterized by IPV, 54.4% and 46.5% were involved in child physical maltreatment over the child's lifetime and in the preceding year, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that children exposed to IPV were at higher risk of being victims of neglect, corporal punishment, and physical maltreatment or severe physical maltreatment by their parents than children who were not exposed to IPV, even when child and parent demographic factors were controlled for. The higher risk of child physical maltreatment associated with IPV highlights the need for an integrated assessment to screen for the presence of multiple forms of family violence within the family, and for intervention to assess effective responses to both IPV and child maltreatment by child protective service workers and domestic violence agencies.

Gender differences in the effects of exposure to intimate partner violence on adolescent violence and drug use

Author: Fagan, Abigail A1; Wright, Emily M1 Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, University of South Carolina, 1305 Greene Street, Columbia, SC 29208, USA

Abstract: This study investigated the long-term effects of exposure to intimate partner violence in the home on adolescent violence and drug use and gender differences in these relationships. Although the general relationship between exposure to IPV and negative outcomes for youth has been demonstrated in past research, gender differences in the effects of IPV on adolescents have been rarely assessed using longitudinal data. Longitudinal data was obtained from 1,315 adolescents and their primary caregivers participating in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN). The sample was 51% female and ethnically diverse (45% Hispanic, 37% African-American, and 14% Caucasian). Two waves of data were assessed to examine the effects of exposure to IPV, reported by caregivers when their children were aged 12 and 15, on violence and drug use, reported by adolescents 3 years later. Multivariate statistical models were employed to control for a range of child, parent, family, and neighborhood risk factors. Exposure to IPV did not significantly predict subsequent violence among males or females in multivariate analyses. IPV exposure was significantly related to the frequency of drug use for females but did not predict drug use among males. This gender difference was not statistically significant, however, which suggests more similarities than differences in the relationship between exposure to IPV and subsequent violence and drug use. This study supports prior research indicating that exposure to IPV can negatively impact adolescent development, but it suggests that these effects may be more likely to influence some outcomes (e.g., drug use) than others (e.g., interpersonal violence). The findings also emphasize the need for additional research examining the overall impact of IPV on adolescent problem behaviors and gender differences in these relationships, including longitudinal studies and investigations that control for a range of other important predictors. A better understanding of these relationships can help inform intervention efforts aimed at ensuring that adolescents living in violent households receive timely and appropriate services to help prevent the occurrence of future problem behaviors.

"They're not my favourite people": What mothers who have experienced intimate partner violence say about involvement in the child protection system

Abstract: Although the primary aim of child protection services (CPS) is to ensure the well-being and safety of children, policy decision-makers and service providers are increasingly concerned about the potential harm children encounter when they witness the abuse of their caregivers. Researchers who have conducted reviews of child protection files in both Canada and the United States report that few cases in which intimate partner violence (IPV) is substantiated are referred for additional services. In this article, we question whether this response is appropriate. Through examining the results of a qualitative study with sixty-four women who experienced IPV and were thus involved in the child protection system, we have been able to analyze the impact of CPS practices on those women who received services and those who did not. Our findings suggest that CPS can be an important resource for women who experience IPV, but changes to current practices are necessary to ensure that services offered are beneficial.

Breaking the Pathways between Domestic Violence and Sexually Transmitted Infections: A Test of Two Theories

Author: Mitchell Fuentes, Catherine M11 Full-time lecturer of anthropology in the Department of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte cfuente4@uncc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902085138?accountid=14925

Abstract: While anthropological research has noted a connection between domestic violence and heightened risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), few studies have attempted to provide a theoretically-based explanation of this correlation. The current mixed-method research, conducted in southern New England, tests two prominent theories with the potential to explain this association: social control theory and resource access theory. Text analysis of in-depth, life history interviews with 28 abused women and multiple regression analysis of data from 215 structured interviews from abused and non-abused women allow us to conclude that, as posited by resource access theory, a woman's level of power (i.e., access to resources) effectively predicts whether she will experience violence and associated STI/HIV risks or affection and minimized sexual risk. Abused women who lack access to positive resources (e.g., support of friends/family, counseling, independent income) are more likely to engage in sexually risky behaviors, while women empowered with such resources are better able to avoid abuse and mitigate its sequelae. Therefore, experiences of domestic violence need not necessitate STI/HIV risk. Specific suggestions for policy and treatment modifications are suggested based on these findings. Adapted from the source document.

Including a Brief Substance-Abuse Motivational Intervention in a Couples Treatment Program for Intimate Partner Violence

Author: McCollum, Eric E1; Stith, Sandra M; Miller, Marjorie Strachman; Ratcliffe, G Cole1 Marriage and Family Therapy Program, Department of Human Development, Virginia Tech-Northern Virginia Center, Falls Church, Virginia, USA

Abstract: Substance abuse (SA) and intimate partner violence (IPV) frequently co-occur, providing challenges to researchers and treatment professionals alike. Researchers have struggled to understand the nature of the relation between these 2 difficult issues. Are they wholly un-related, indirectly related, or is there a causal relation between the 2? Treatment professionals face the dilemma of how to provide treatment to clients who abuse substances and who are violent with their intimate others. Most treatment for these 2 disorders is provided separately with varying degrees of effort to coordinate services. Models of combined treatment are few, and none address couples in which both partners are violent or abuse substances. This article briefly reviews the literature on SA and IPV, and then describes a 1-session SA intervention, based on Motivational Interviewing, which has been added to the conjoint couples treatment model for IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Children's Perceptions of Intimate Partner Violence: Causes, Consequences, and Coping

Author: DeBoard-Lucas, Renee L1; Grych, John H1 Department of Psychology, Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902080032?accountid=14925

Abstract: Children's appraisals of conflictual and aggressive parental interactions mediate their effect on children's adjustment. Previous studies have relied almost exclusively on self-report questionnaires to assess appraisals; consequently we know little about perceptions that occur naturally when children witness interparental aggression. This study employed a semi-structured interview to assess the thoughts and feelings of 34 children (ages 7-12) whose mothers were receiving services at domestic violence agencies, and mothers reported on interparental aggression that took place in the home. Children's thoughts centered on consequences and efforts to understand why fights occurred. They generally viewed their mother's partner as responsible for violence, though a significant number viewed both parents as playing a role. Sadness and anger were more common than anxiety, and children often attempted to stop or withdraw from fights or both. When asked why family violence occurs, most focused on perpetrators' lack of control of anger or personal characteristics, but approximately one-third viewed victims as provoking aggression. These findings support the idea that children actively attempt to understand the causes and consequences of interparental violence and suggest that their perceptions and interpretations are important for understanding the development of beliefs regarding the use of violence in close relationships. Adapted from the source document.

The Impact of Children on Legal Actions Taken by Women Victims of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Rhodes, Karin Verlaine1; Dichter, Melissa E; Kothari, Catherine L; Marcus, Steven C; Cerulli, Catherine1 Department of Emergency Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA, kvr@sp2.upenn.edu

Abstract: Successful criminal or civil legal system response to assaults against intimate partners (intimate partner violence; IPV) usually rely on the victim's participation in the legal process, including having contact with the prosecutor, filing charges, and/or applying for an order of personal protection. Using data abstracted from criminal and civil legal system records for a county-wide cohort of 990 female IPV victims over a 4-year period, we examine the impact of having children, and of specific child factors, on victims' engagement with the criminal prosecution of their abusive partners and/or seeking a personal protection order (PPO) in the civil court system. Having children increased victim's contact with the prosecutor and applications for PPOs, but did not increase her likelihood of wanting to file or drop charges. Findings support prior work suggesting both the importance and complexity of children on mothers' decision-making. Policy makers and service providers may want to assess survivors' thoughts about the role children play in their decision-making. Additionally, by offering survivors interventions to help their children address the impact of IPV exposure, survivors may be more willing to engage with services.

Abstract: The current study investigated whether differences in loneliness scores between individuals with a distressed personality type (type D personality) and subjects without such a personality varied by domestic violence victimization. Participants (N=625) were recruited by random sampling from the Municipal Basic Administration of the Dutch city of 's-Hertogenbosch and were invited to fill out a set of questionnaires on health status. For this study, only ratings for domestic violence victimization, type D personality, feelings of loneliness, and demographics were used. Statistical analyses yielded main effects on loneliness for both type D personality and history of domestic violence victimization. Above and beyond these main effects, their interaction was significantly associated with loneliness as well. However, this result seemed to apply to emotional loneliness in particular. Findings were discussed in light of previous research and study limitations. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Against Women: Is Women Empowerment a Reducing Factor? A Study from a National Bangladeshi Sample

Author: Rahman, Mosfequr1; Hoque, Md Aminul; Makinoda, Satoru1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kanazawa Medical University, 1-1 Daigaku, Uchinada, Kahoku, Ishikawa, 920-0293, Japan

Abstract: This article explores how women empowerment affects Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in Bangladesh using a cross-sectional investigation of currently married women (n=4,181) sampled via the Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey (BDHS), 2007. About one-fourth (24%) of currently married Bangladeshi women experienced both physical and/or sexual IPV in the past year. Prevalence of physical and sexual violence was 19.4% and 10.5%, respectively. Younger generation (age 15-24), illiterate, rural, and the poorest household wealth categorized women were much victimized. Current employment status predicted intimate partner violence. Household decision-making pattern also emerged as a predictor of IPV. Likelihood of all forms of IPV increases with increase of number of participation in household decision-making. Promoting women empowerment in the household without men's support may put women at more risk of IPV. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1018347548?accountid=14925

Abstract: Contemporary military service members and their families face unique stressors that impact the quality of romantic relationships. With divorce rates among military couples on the rise, the authors focused on the relationships between posttraumatic stress disorder, intimate partner violence, and attachment style. Subjects consisted of 20 heterosexual couples, where the male was the service member. Researchers used a series of path models to determine if a link existed between these variables. Results highlight the important role of spouses in the service members' experience of posttraumatic stress disorder, intimate partner violence, and attachment. Implications for research and working with military couples are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Association between Early Marriage and Intimate Partner Violence in India: A Focus on Youth from Bihar and Rajasthan

Author: Speizer, Ilene S1; Pearson, Erin1 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Gillings School of Global Public Health, ilene_speizer@unc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/886175009?accountid=14925

Abstract: The relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and early marriage is explored using the 2005-2006 India National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3). The NFHS-3 collected data from a representative sample of women and men in India with a large enough sample size to have a representative sample at the state level. The focus is on youth from Bihar and Rajasthan, two states with high IPV and early marriage. Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrate that women aged 20 to 24 who married before age eighteen, the legal age at marriage in India, are more likely to have ever experienced IPV in their lifetime and recently experienced IPV (in the last 12 months) than their counterparts who married later. The results were significant in Rajasthan but not in Bihar. To reduce IPV, targeted efforts must be made to decrease the proportion of India's girls who are married under the legal age of marriage.

Intimate Partner Violence Among General and Urban Poor Populations in Kathmandu, Nepal

Abstract: Comparative studies are lacking on intimate partner violence (IPV) between urban poor and general populations. The objective of this study is to identify the prevalence and risk factors of physical IPV among the general and poor populations in urban Nepal. A cross-sectional study was conducted by structured questionnaire interview. Participants included 905 ever-married women in Kathmandu aged 15 to 49 years. Of the 905 participants, 680 were randomly selected from general population and 225 were recruited from urban poor population, who lived in purposively selected two communities. The prevalence and association between ever experiencing physical IPV and sociodemographic variables were examined. Results showed that the prevalence of physical IPV was 33.8% among the urban poor population (n = 225) and 19.9% among the general population (n = 680; p < .01). Several factors were significantly associated with physical IPV in both populations: the frequency of the husband's drinking, polygyny, and lower household economic status. However, two factors were associated with physical IPV only among the general population: the husband's lower educational level and early marriage. The conclusions of this study are that compared to the general population, the urban poor population showed a significantly higher prevalence of physical IPV and differences in the associated risk factors. The urban poor population requires focused data collection as well as tailored interventions to reduce IPV.

Risky Lifestyle as a Mediator of the Relationship Between Deviant Peer Affiliation and Dating Violence Victimization Among Adolescent Girls

Author: Vezina, Johanne1; Hebert, Martine; Poulin, Francois; Lavoie, Francine; Vitaro, Frank; Tremblay, Richard E1 Departement de Psychologie, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada jovezina18@videotron.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037878202?accountid=14925

Abstract: Few studies have explored the possible contribution of the peer group to dating violence victimization. The current study tested the hypothesis that a risky lifestyle would mediate the relationship between deviant peer affiliation and dating violence victimization among adolescent girls. The proposed mediation model was derived from lifestyles and routine activities theories. A sample of 550 girls (mean age = 15) drawn from a larger representative community sample in Quebec, Canada, completed a questionnaire on three forms of dating violence victimization (psychological, physical, and sexual). Results revealed that girls with a higher level of affiliation with deviant peers were more likely to endorse a risky lifestyle and reported higher rates of all forms of dating violence victimization. Further analyses showed that, while deviant peer affiliation is associated with dating violence victimization, this relationship may be explained, at least partially for psychological violence, and completely for physical/sexual violence, by the girls' own risky lifestyle. Future preventive interventions for adolescent dating violence victimization should target deviant peer groups, as well as adolescent girls who display a risky lifestyle. Adapted from the source document.

Violence against women is strongly associated with suicide attempts: Evidence from the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women

Abstract: Suicidal behaviours are one of the most important contributors to the global burden of disease among women, but little is known about prevalence and modifiable risk factors in low and middle income countries. We use data from the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women to examine the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts, and relationships between suicide attempts and mental health status, child sexual abuse, partner violence and other variables. Population representative cross-sectional household surveys were conducted from 2000-2003 in 13 provincial (more rural) and city (urban) sites in Brazil, Ethiopia, Japan, Namibia, Peru, Samoa, Serbia, Thailand and Tanzania. 20967 women aged 15-49 years participated. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts, lifetime suicidal thoughts, and suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks were calculated, and multivariate logistic regression models were fit to examine factors associated with suicide attempts in each site. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts ranged from 0.8% (Tanzania) to 12.0% (Peru city); lifetime thoughts of suicide from 7.2% (Tanzania province) to 29.0% (Peru province), and thoughts in the past four weeks from 1.9% (Serbia) to 13.6% (Peru province). 25-50% of women with suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks had also visited a health worker in that time. The most consistent risk factors for suicide attempts after adjusting for probable common mental health disorders were: intimate partner violence, non-partner physical violence, ever being divorced, separated or widowed, childhood sexual abuse and having a mother who had experienced intimate partner violence. Mental health policies and services must recognise the consistent relationship between violence and suicidality in women in low and middle income countries. Training health sector workers to recognize and respond to the consequences of violence may substantially reduce the health burden associated with suicidal behaviour. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

The Three Planet Model: Towards an Understanding of Contradictions in Approaches to Women and Children's Safety in Contexts of Domestic Violence

Author: Hester, Marianne11 Professor of Gender, Violence and International Policy in the School for Policy Studies, University of Bristol marianne.hester@bristol.ac.uk

Abstract: Despite the development of much positive work by to tackle domestic violence, frustrations are often voiced by social care and other professionals -- and echoed in women's and children's experiences -- that it can be difficult to ensure and sustain safe outcomes for women and children in circumstances of domestic violence. The article takes as its starting point these frustrations and difficulties, and provides an attempt at understanding some of the systemic problems practitioners may be facing that undermine the effectiveness of their practice. The article explores in particular some of the tensions and contradictions that are evident in professional discourses and practices across work with victims and perpetrators of domestic violence; child protection and safeguarding; and child contact. These three areas of work are especially difficult to bring together into a cohesive and co-ordinated approach because they are effectively on separate 'planets' -- with their own separate histories, culture, laws, and populations (sets of professionals). The notion of separate 'planets' can also be understood in light of what Bourdieu (1989) would call the 'habitus' of groups, where the particular structures, orientations and approaches in the work of a professional group may create divides between their own everyday and common place professional assumptions and practices and those of other professional groups. Tackling the 'three planet problem', and dealing more effectively with domestic violence as it impacts on adults and children, requires both a unified approach across the separate 'planet' areas and acknowledgement of the processes of gendering that are situating women as culpable victims. It requires much closer and coherent practices across the three areas of work, with acknowledgement and understanding of professional assumptions and practices of different professional groups. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Against Deaf Female College Students

Author: Anderson, Melissa L1; Leigh, Irene W1 Gallaudet University, Washington, DC, USA, melissa.anderson@gallaudet.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/886259827?accountid=14925

Abstract: It has been estimated that roughly 25% of all Deaf women in the United States are victims of intimate partner violence (Abused Deaf Women's Advocacy Services [ADWAS]), a figure similar to annual prevalence rates of 16% to 30% for intimate partners in the general population. One goal of the present study was to ascertain the prevalence of intimate partner violence victimization in a sample of Deaf female college students. When comparing the prevalence of physical assault, psychological aggression, and sexual coercion victimization to hearing female undergraduates, the current sample was approximately two times as likely to have experienced victimization in the past year.

Pregnancy and Intimate Partner Violence: Risk Factors, Severity, and Health Effects

Author: Brownridge, Douglas A1; Taillieu, Tamara L; Tyler, Kimberly A; Tiwari, Agnes; Chan, Ko Ling; Santos, Susy C1 University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/907929743?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study compares female victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) who were and were not victimized during pregnancy. Victims of pregnancy violence are more likely to report having experienced all forms of violence, particularly severe forms, and have higher odds of experiencing several postviolence indicators of severity and adverse health consequences. The significance of predictors disappears in a post hoc analysis controlling for proxies of battering behavior (i.e., repeated and severe violence), suggesting that victims who experience violence during pregnancy may be more likely to be in a current intimate relationship with an abuser who inflicts repeated and severe IPV.

Gender Sensitivity Among Social Workers Handling Cases of Domestic Violence: A Hong Kong Case

Author: Leung, Lai Ching11 Department of Applied Social Studies, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, sslc@cityu.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/922958541?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines gender sensitivity among social workers in different service settings, who handle domestic violence cases and its implications for social workers' professional development in Hong Kong. The findings of in-depth interviews with both social workers and survivors of domestic violence revealed that the major difference in the handling of domestic violence cases by social workers in family settings and those working in shelters or with survivors' groups is that the former perceive women's problems as family problems that require mediation and adjustment, whereas the latter consider them to arise from an imbalance in power relations between men and women, thus leading them to focus on enhancing women's well-being in their practice. Helping social workers to recognize structural inequality between men and women is the starting point for the development of gender-sensitive practice in domestic violence cases.

Key decisions in child protection services in cases of domestic violence: maintaining services and out-of-home placement

Author: Lavergne, Chantal1; Damant, Dominique; Clement, Marie-Eve; Bourassa, Chantal; Lessard, Genevieve; Turcotte, Pierre1 Centre Jeunesse de Montreal-Institut Universitaire, Montreal, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/889458088?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper looks at the response of the child protection services (CPS) system in cases where exposure to domestic violence occurs alone or together with abuse or neglect, focusing on the factors involved in decisions to maintain the case open for ongoing services or remove children from the home. The study is based on an analysis of clinical and administrative data from the files on children reported to a CPS agency in Montreal, Canada. A total of 1 071 substantiated reports were documented, including 337 cases of co-occurrence (32%). Analysis of the data shows that domestic violence does not by itself constitute a factor liable to lead to more intrusive intervention. The CPS response appears to be influenced more by the existence of other forms of maltreatment and risk factors. Additionally, while domestic violence may be associated with more severe individual and family problems, it does not influence the decision to keep the case open because the child still need services. The lack of any connection between domestic violence and this decision is a cause for concern, as results indicate that such families need help. Knowing how to respond to their needs therefore remains a major challenge.

Preschool Children's Cardiac Reactivity Moderates Relations Between Exposure to Family Violence and Emotional Adjustment

Author: Cipriano, Elizabeth A1; Skowron, Elizabeth A; Gatzke-Kopp, Lisa M1 Child Study Center, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902083149?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined relations between cardiac reactivity, family violence exposure (i.e., Child Maltreatment [CM] and inter-partner violence [IPV]), and preschool children's emotional adjustment. A sample of 92 mother-preschooler dyads was drawn from predominantly low-income, rural communities. Dyads participated in a laboratory session in which children's Electrocardiograph (ECG) monitoring occurred during a resting baseline, joint-challenge, and individual emotional and cognitive tasks. Mothers consented to review of Children & Youth Services (CYS) records for CM and completed an IPV measure. Mothers rated children's emotional adjustment, and observers rated children on their frustration and positive affect. Children's vagal suppression was shown to moderate relations between family violence exposure and emotional adjustment. Findings indicated that children greater in vagal suppression showed better emotional adjustment when from families low in violence. However, regardless of children's level of vagal suppression, all children showed poorer emotional adjustment when from families high in violence.

Abstract: This article examines the state of domestic violence in Puerto Rico. It investigates the ways by which grassroots movements and governmental agencies work collaboratively and independently towards the eradication of violence and discrimination against women on the islands. It also explores the island's past experience in managing change to create systems and programs that ensure women's human rights and gender equality. It analyzes related legal reform in Puerto Rico within the context of human rights. Adapted from the source document.

Appropriate police response to domestic violence: Comparing perceptions of Chinese and American college students

Author: Sun, Ivan Y1; Wu, Yuning; Button, Deeanna; Li, Jessica C.M.; Su, Mingyue1 Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, USA isun@udel.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919904358?accountid=14925

Abstract: While domestic violence has emerged as a global concern since the 1970s, empirical research on public preferences for police response to domestic violence is lacking. Even rarer is investigating the issue from an international, comparative perspective. Using survey data collected from more than one thousand college students in two Chinese and two U.S. cities, this study compared Chinese and American citizens' attitudes toward traditional and proactive police response to domestic violence and tested the effects of demographic characteristics, attitudes toward violence and gender roles, personal experiences with domestic violence, and locality on such attitudes. Chinese students were found to be more likely than American students to favor traditional response and less likely to support proactive response. Chinese and American students' attitudes toward police response to domestic violence were influenced by both different and common factors. Implications for policy and future research are discussed.

Contact, Shared Parenting, And Violence: Children As Witnesses Of Domestic Violence In Sweden

Author: Eriksson, Maria11 Department of Sociology, Uppsala University, Box 624, SE 751 26 Uppsala, Sweden maria.eriksson@soc.uu.se

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919903201?accountid=14925

Abstract: As in many other countries in the West, Swedish policy and law presupposes shared parenting and a high degree of parental co-operation after separation or divorce. Parents are expected to share the legal responsibility for the child and face-to-face contact is presumed to be in the best interests of the child. It was not until the new millennium that intimate partner violence was placed upon the policy agenda to any greater extent in the field of family law. The legislation has recently been revised with the aim of ensuring a higher degree of safety for both abused parents and children. The re-definition of children exposed to violence as crime victims seems to be a key to these changes. In many ways, the development regarding intimate partner violence represents a significant change of direction in Swedish policy in the area of family law. However, it is argued that policy makers need to pay more attention to the implementation of safety-oriented reforms. The discussion demonstrates how three social positions available for children in this context -- the witness, the victim, and the competent participant -- form a relational pattern full of tensions that creates challenges for everyday professional practice. The article highlights how the ambiguity in the perspective on children, constructing them as both 'becomings' and 'beings' may undermine policy intentions to create a higher degree of safety in the field of family law for this particular group of vulnerable children. Adapted from the source document.

'Acting in the Children's Best Interest?': Examining Victims' Responses to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Meyer, Silke11 Institute For Social Science Research, The University of Queensland, St Lucia Campus (Bldg 31B), Brisbane, QLD, 4072, Australia s.meyer@uq.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1018338856?accountid=14925

Abstract: Victims' responses to violent experiences within intimate relationships are highly diverse and can range from remaining silent, at least temporarily, to disclosing the abuse to informal and formal sources of support. Decisions to remain silent or to reach out for support are influenced by a complex range of factors, including situational circumstances, such as the presence of children. Using data from in-depth interviews with victims of IPV (N = 29) in Southeast Queensland, Australia, I examined victims' responses to IPV when children are present in the abusive household. Victims, who accessed general formal support sources, including the criminal justice systems and Child Protection Services (CPS), frequently faced stereotypical and victim-blaming attitudes along with a lack of understanding of the dynamics of IPV and the circumstances surrounding victims' help-seeking decisions. The presence of children in abuse relationships complicated victims' help-seeking decisions because fear of harm and loss of custody often delayed or hindered the disclosure of IPV to formal support sources. Once disclosing the abuse victims often found themselves trapped between CPS expectations to protect their children by leaving the abusive partner and a reluctance on behalf of judges and magistrates to offer the necessary protection by including children on granted Domestic Violence Orders (DVO). These findings highlight the ongoing need for specialized training of CPS personnel, judges and magistrates along with an ongoing collaboration with the women's sector to ensure the safety of victims and their children throughout the help-seeking process and to improve victims' confidence in disclosing IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Interpersonal Problems as a Mediator between Attachment and Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Lawson, David M1; Malnar, Stevie G1 Department of Human Services, Stephen F. Austin State University, Box 13019, Nacogdoches, TX, 75963-3019, USA, lawsondm@sfasu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/886011683?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although attachment and interpersonal problems are associated with intimate partner violence (IPV), their interrelationship in predicting IPV has not been examined. The present study examined whether hostile dominant interpersonal problems (i.e., domineering, vindictive, and intrusive) mediate the relationship between attachment (anxious and avoidant) and IPV (violence severity and psychological aggression) in a sample 100 partner violent men. Several meditational analyses were conducted based on Baron and Kenny's (1986) model for mediation, including the bootstrap analysis of the sampling distribution of the indirect effect. Significant results indicated that (a) hostile dominant interpersonal problems mediated the relationship between avoidant attachment and violence severity, and (b) hostile dominant interpersonal problems mediated the relationship between avoidant attachment and psychological aggression. Hostile dominant interpersonal problems did not mediate the relationship between anxious attachment and violence severity or psychological aggression. Implications of the findings for the treatment of IPV are discussed.

Determinants of Domestic Violence: Evidence from Malaysia

Author: Awang, Halimah1; Hariharan, Sharon1 Faculty of Economics and Administration, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1030866680?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study investigates the determinants of domestic violence, which is often unseen, and is a widespread form of gender-based violence affecting women the world over. The analysis is limited to the household impact in examining how demographic and marital capital factors relate to domestic violence in Malaysia. Empirical evidence used in this study is based on secondary data obtained from Women's Aid Organisation's case files. Results indicate three variables, specifically the perpetrator's age, the survivor's income status, and the number of children, show a significant link to the level of violence in a household.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1030866690?accountid=14925

Abstract: The objective of this study was to investigate psychological or physical violence associated with the use of alcohol, in residences of individuals in Brazil and, also describe the social characteristics of aggressors and victims. Therefore, this study expects to contribute to studies in Brazil that seek to clarify the relations between alcohol and violence in residences. A total of 454 respondents, 12-65 years old, were assessed, they were sorted by the Kish method, and the residences randomly. The SAMHSA questionnaire was utilized after translated and adapted to Brazilian conditions. 26% of the individuals reported psychological violence, and 16% reported physical violence. The study's main results set the differences in the reports for physical violence (OR 7, 95% CI: 4-13) and psychological violence (OR 5, 95% CI: 3-8) in residences where someone arrived or became intoxicated with alcohol (P<0.05). 50% of the aggressors were under the effects of alcohol, and 77% of the victims were relatives of their aggressors. Acts of violence are not necessarily associated with alcohol consumption. Men and women reported acts of domestic violence; psychological violence was the most prevalent form. Men are currently the primary aggressors, while women are primarily the victims. Adapted from the source document.

The Helpseeking Experiences of Men Who Sustain Intimate Partner Violence: An Overlooked Population and Implications for Practice

Author: Douglas, Emily M1; Hines, Denise A1 School of Social Work, Bridgewater State University, 95 Burrill Ave, Bridgewater, MA, 02325, USA, Emily.Douglas@bridgew.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/886001498?accountid=14925

Abstract: For over 30 years, research has shown that men can and do sustain intimate partner violence (IPV) from their female partners. This is the first large-scale, nationally-based, quantitative study to systematically detail the helpseeking experiences of men who have sustained IPV from their female partners. The sample is composed of 302 men who were recruited from resources specializing in men's issues. Results indicate that men who seek help for IPV victimization have the most positive experiences in seeking help from family/friends, and mental health and medical providers. They have the least positive experiences with members of the DV service system. Cumulative positive helpseeking experiences were associated with lower levels of abusing alcohol; cumulative negative experiences were associated with higher rates of exceeding a clinical cut-off for post-traumatic stress disorder. Results are discussed in terms of implications for the social service sector and for future research.

The Association Between Different Types of Intimate Partner Violence Experienced by Women

Author: Krebs, Christopher1; Breiding, Matthew J; Browne, Angela; Warner, Tara1 RTI International, Crime, Violence, and Justice Research Program, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC, 27709, USA krebs@rti.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1030866721?accountid=14925

Abstract: Those who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) are often subjected to multiple types of victimization such as physical violence, sexual violence, psychological aggression, and stalking. However, relatively few studies have used a national population-based sample and multivariate methods to analyze the associations between these different types of violence. This study uses multivariate methods to analyze a national population-based sample of women in order to document empirically the extent to which different types of IPV overlap, while controlling for personal and behavioral characteristics. Results indicated significant levels of overlap, with victims often experiencing more than one type of victimization by an intimate partner. Findings also indicated that women who had experienced violence by non-intimate partners were often more likely to experience violence by intimates. Finally, women who had experienced stalking by an intimate were more likely to experience more forms of IPV on average than those who had experienced physical violence, sexual violence, or emotional aggression.

Optimal Methods to Screen Men and Women for Intimate Partner Violence: Results From an Internal Medicine Residency Continuity Clinic

Author: Kapur, Nitin A1; Windish, Donna M1 Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT nitin.a.kapur@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902084710?accountid=14925

Abstract: Contradictory data exist regarding optimal methods and instruments for intimate partner violence (IPV) screening in primary care settings. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal method and screening instrument for IPV among men and women in a primary-care resident clinic. We conducted a cross-sectional study at an urban, academic, internal medicine residency continuity clinic in Connecticut among English or Spanish speaking adult patients. One group of patients (n = 340) received a self-administered questionnaire (SAQ) containing the partner violence screen (PVS) and the Hurt, Insulted, Threatened or Screamed at Questionnaire (HITS). A second group (n = 126) was screened with PVS and HITS by their primary care providers during face-to-face (FTF) clinical encounters. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the association between IPV prevalence and screening method (SAQ or FTF) after adjusting for socio-demographic effects. The overall IPV prevalence was 17.3% using the SAQ and 9.0% with FTF screening (p = .008). Patients receiving the SAQ were more likely to report IPV than those who were screened FTF (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-5.6). This effect persisted for women, who had a higher odds of IPV when screened through a SAQ than when screened FTF (AOR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.4-8.6). Men did not differ in reporting IPV between methods: 11% with SAQ versus 9.4% FTF (p = .69). In internal medicine residency continuity clinics, a SAQ for IPV may result in higher disclosure and completion rates among female patients compared to FTF screening. Unique screening instruments and methods may be needed for men. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Children's Experiences of Domestic Violence: Developing an Integrated Response From Police and Child Protection Services

Author: Stanley, Nicky1; Miller, Pam; Foster, Helen Richardson; Thomson, Gill1 University of Central Lancashire, Preston, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902084714?accountid=14925

Abstract: Police notifications of incidents of domestic violence to child protection services constitute an acknowledgement of the harm that domestic violence inflicts on children. However, these notifications represent a substantial demand on child welfare services and the outcomes for children and victims of domestic violence have been questioned. This paper presents findings from the first UK study to examine these notifications in depth and examines the interface between the police and child protection services in responding to domestic violence incidents. The research reports on police interventions in 251 incidents of domestic violence involving children; the communication of information to child protection services and the subsequent filtering and service response. Social workers found that notifications conveyed little information on children's experiences of domestic violence. Forty per cent of families notified had had no previous contact with child protection services in that area, but those cases most likely to receive social work assessment or intervention were those where the case was already open. Notifications triggered a new social work intervention in only 5% of cases. The study also identified a range of innovative approaches for improving the co-ordination of police and child protective services in relation to children's exposure to domestic violence. Arrangements that maximized opportunities for police and social workers to share agency information appeared to offer the best option for achieving informed decisions about the appropriate level of service response to children and families experiencing domestic violence.

ACASI and Face-to-Face Interviews Yield Inconsistent Estimates of Domestic Violence Among Women in India: The Samata Health Study 2005-2009

Author: Rathod, Sujit D1; Minnis, Alexandra M; Subbiah, Kalyani; Krishnan, Suneeta1 University of California, Berkeley, sujit.rathod@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/886236071?accountid=14925

Abstract: Background. Audio computer-assisted self-interviews (ACASI) are increasingly used in health research to improve the accuracy of data on sensitive behaviors. However, evidence is limited on its use among low-income populations in countries like India and for measurement of sensitive issues such as domestic violence. Method. We compared reports of domestic violence and three less sensitive behaviors related to household decision making and spousal communication in ACASI and face-to-face interviews (FTFI) among 464 young married women enrolled in a longitudinal study of gender-based power and adverse health outcomes in low-income communities in Bangalore, India. We used a test-retest design. At the 12-month study visit, we elicited responses from each participant through FTFI first, followed by ACASI. At the 24-month visit, we reversed the order, implementing ACASI first, followed by FTFI. Univariable log-linear regression models and kappa statistics were used to examine ACASI's effects on self-reports. Results. Regression results showed significantly lower reporting in ACASI relative to FTFI at both visits, including for domestic violence (12-month risk ratio [RR] = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.52, 0.73; 24-month RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.62, 0.89). Response agreement between interview modes, calculated by kappa scores, was universally low, though highest for domestic violence (12-month Kappa = 0.45; 24-month Kappa = 0.48). Older age and greater educational attainment appeared associated with higher response agreement. Conclusions. Greater reporting in FTFI may be due to social desirability bias for the less sensitive questions and perceptions of therapeutic benefit for domestic violence. These results cast doubt on the appropriateness of using ACASI for measurement of sensitive behaviors in India.

Differential Therapeutic Outcomes of Community-Based Group Interventions for Women and Children Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: McWhirter, Paula T11 University of Oklahoma paulamcwhirter@ou.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902084551?accountid=14925

Abstract: Two community-based group therapies, emotion focused versus goal oriented, are compared among women exposed to intimate partner violence (n = 46) and their children (n = 48) aged between 6 and 12 years. A series of repeated measures analyses are employed to evaluate the effects of time from baseline to postintervention following random assignment. Main and treatment effects for women provide support for the relative effectiveness in increasing quality of social support in the emotion-focused intervention and in the reduction of both family conflict and alcohol use for the goal-oriented intervention.

Risk Assessments by Female Victims of Intimate Partner Violence: Predictors of Risk Perceptions and Comparison to an Actuarial Measure

Author: Connor-Smith, Jennifer K1; Henning, Kris; Moore, Stephanie; Holdford, Robert1 Portland State University, Portland, OR

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/902085289?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recent studies support the validity of both structured risk assessment tools and victim perceptions as predictors of risk for repeat intimate partner violence (IPV). Combining structured risk assessments and victim risk assessments leads to better predictions of repeat violence than either alone, suggesting that the two forms of assessment provide unique and complementary information. However, very little is known about elements involved in women's risk assessments. The present study explores predictors of women's risk assessment and differences in factors linked to victim and actuarial risk assessments in a large sample of women (N = 728) shortly after the arrest of their male partner for IPV. In multivariate analyses, women's risk assessments were strongly related to past relationship violence and their partner's substance abuse but weakly related to demographic factors, family constellation, and the partner's criminal history. Women who perceived high risk but had a low risk score on an actuarial measure were more likely to report the presence of dynamic risk factors, such as escalating violence and violence during separations, along with a history of emotional and psychological abuse. Qualitative findings paralleled quantitative findings, with women's stated reasons for expecting high or low risk indicating that women were attending to IPV history and dynamic factors. Implications for risk assessment and safety planning are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Prevalence and Correlates of Suicidal Behavior among Adult Female Victims of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Cavanaugh, Courtenay E1; Messing, Jill Theresa; Del-Colle, Melissa; O'Sullivan, Chris; Campbell, Jacquelyn C1 Rutgers University, Department of Psychology, Camden, NJ

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429626325?accountid=14925

Abstract: The prevalence and correlates of suicidal threats and attempts among 662 racially and ethnically diverse adult female victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) were studied. One in five women had threatened or attempted suicide during her lifetime. They observed that multiple logistic regression results indicated that women at greater risk of severe or potentially lethal assaults as measured by the Danger Assessment and those who reported having a chronic or disabling illness were more likely to have threatened or attempted suicide. A linear association was found between age and suicide threats/attempts, with younger women having increased odds. Finally, African American IPV victims were less likely to have threatened or attempted suicide as compared to Latina victims. Study implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Characteristics of Women Who Do and Do Not Receive Onsite Shelter Services From Domestic Violence Programs

Author: Grossman, Susan F1; Lundy, Marta1 Loyola University Chicago, School of Social Work

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925714288?accountid=14925

Abstract: Shelter services are an essential means of providing help to women who are victims of intimate partner violence (IPV), but not all victims receive shelter. This article reports the results of a secondary analysis of statewide data from women using IPV services, comparing victims who did and did not obtain shelter. The demographic characteristics, abuse experiences, and service patterns of these survivors are examined. A model predicting characteristics associated with the likelihood of shelter receipt indicates that women who obtain shelter are more vulnerable and obtain more services than women who do not obtain shelter. The implications of these results are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Welfare Caseworker Assessments and Domestic Violence Services: Findings From Administrative Data and Case Narratives

Author: Hetling, Andrea11 Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA ahetling@rci.rutgers.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925713097?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Family Violence Option (FVO) protects welfare recipients who are domestic violence victims or survivors by providing service referrals and waivers from certain requirements. Implementation of the FVO has been difficult for welfare agencies and disclosures and service uptake have been low. Using administrative data and caseworker notes, this study compares demographic and case characteristics and abuse experiences among four analytic groups. Although differences in demographics are most pronounced between victims and nonvictims, experiences with abuse and services differed between victims who received waivers versus those who did not.

Abstract: This study uses National Violence Against Women Survey data to investigate the differential impact of concomitant forms of violence (sexual abuse, stalking, and psychological abuse) and ethnicity on help-seeking behaviors of women physically abused by an intimate partner (n = 1,756). Controlling for severity of the physical abuse, women who experienced concomitant sexual abuse are less likely to seek help, women who experienced concomitant stalking are more likely to seek help, whereas concomitant psychological abuse is not associated with help seeking. Ethnic differences are found in help seeking from friends, mental health professionals, police, and orders of protection. Implications for service outreach are discussed.

Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in the Capital Province of Sri Lanka: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Help Seeking

Author: Jayasuriya, Vathsala1; Wijewardena, Kumudu; Axemo, Pia1 University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka v.jayasuriya@londonmet.ac.uk

Abstract: This article presents findings from a cross-sectional community survey exploring intimate partner violence (IPV) against women in the Western province of Sri Lanka. Findings show that lifetime prevalence of physical violence (34%), controlling behavior (30%), and emotional abuse (19%) was high and the prevalence of sexual violence was low (5%). Young women and those with partners who abused alcohol/drugs and had extra-marital affairs are at increased risk of violence. Although living in a patriarchal society, low prevalence of child marriages and lack of dowry-related violence could be to Sri Lankan women's advantage relative to their Asian counterparts in preventing IPV.

Attributing Selected Costs to Intimate Partner Violence in a Sample of Women Who Have Left Abusive Partners: A Social Determinants of Health Approach

Author: Varcoe, Colleen1; Hankivsky, Olena; Ford-Gilboe, Marilyn; Wuest, Judith; Wilk, Piotr; Hammerton, Joanne; Campbell, Jacquelyn1 School of Nursing, University of British Columbia, Vancouver

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964198055?accountid=14925

Abstract: Selected costs associated with intimate partner violence were estimated for a community sample of 309 Canadian women who left abusive male partners on average 20 months previously. Total annual estimated costs of selected public- and private-sector expenditures attributable to violence were $13,162.39 per woman. This translates to a national annual cost of $6.9 billion for women aged 19-65 who have left abusive partners; $3.1 billion for those experiencing violence within the past three years. Results indicate that costs continue long after leaving, and call for recognition in policy that leaving does not coincide with ending violence. Adapted from the source document.

Maternal experiences of childhood abuse and intimate partner violence: Psychopathology and functional impairment in clinical children and adolescents

Author: Miranda, Jenniffer K1; de la Osa, Nuria; Granero, Roser; Ezpeleta, Lourdes1 Unit of Epidemiology and Diagnosis in Developmental Psychopathology, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925713489?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study examined the independent effects of mothers' childhood abuse (CA) and intimate partner violence (IPV) on psychopathology and functional impairment in children; and the potential moderating and mediating role of individual and family factors in these relationships. Additionally, this study explored the potential cumulative effects of both maternal CA and IPV on children's outcomes. The sample included 547 Spanish children and adolescents aged between 8 and 17 years, and their parents, who had accessed mental health services. The assessment was based on structured interviews with the children and their parents. Statistical analyses were carried out through hierarchical multiple, negative-binomial and logistic regressions, and Structural Equation Models. Children whose mothers experienced CA and those whose mothers suffered physical IPV showed increased DSM-IV disruptive disorders and externalizing behavior problems, respectively. Children who directly observed physical IPV and also suffered physical punishment by parents showed increased internalizing problems. IPV had effects, either direct or indirect by physical punishment, on children's externalizing problems. Cumulative effect analyses indicated that the prevalence of disruptive disorders was highest in children whose mothers had suffered both CA and IPV. Spanish children whose mothers have suffered CA, IPV or both, are at high risk of serious conduct problems, whereas children exposed to IPV and who were also physically abused are at greater risk of internalizing problems. Physical punishment of children contributes in part to explain externalizing problems of IPV-exposed children. These findings indicate potential targets of assessment and intervention for families seeking help in mental health services. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

Mandatory reporting of domestic violence cases in Cyprus: barriers to the effectiveness of mandatory reporting and issues for future practice

Author: Panayiotopoulos, Christos11 University of Nicosia, Nicosia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023027433?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence and child abuse rates have been slowly but steadily increasing since 2000 in Cyprus. Both the police and social services departments report alarming changes in the way families function nowadays in Cyprus. However this is not a new problem. In order to monitor the phenomenon and to be able to design policy programmes, the law services introduced, in 1998, mandatory reporting of all child abuse and domestic violence cases to the Attorney General's Office. Seven years later there were no signs of significant changes, and the real causes for this were unknown. The aim of this paper is to report on the evaluation of mandatory reporting. The study investigated causes and obstacles that seemed to lead to the insufficient implementation of mandatory reporting. The views of all stakeholders involved were collected. Findings indicated that although several services make use of mandatory reporting, they report gaps in the policy, poor planning on behalf of the law services and lack of coordination and communication between all the services involved. Findings suggest the development of a mediator scheme, which can act as a screening point and liaise with the final service (Attorney General's Office) and reporters/services. Adapted from the source document.

Perceptions of Factors Contributing to Intimate Partner Violence Among Sri Lankan Tamil Immigrant Women in Canada

Author: Hyman, Ilene1; Mason, Robin; Guruge, Sepali; Berman, Helene; Kanagaratnam, Pushpa; Manuel, Lisa1 Dalla Lana School of Public Health; and Cities Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023028003?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article we explore Sri Lankan Tamil immigrant women's views on factors contributing to intimate partner violence (IPV). We conducted eight focus groups with young, midlife, and senior women and women who experienced IPV. Three main themes emerged: postmigration sources of stress and conflict, patriarchal social norms that dictated gendered behavior, and individual male attributes and behaviors. Study participants recognized gender inequality and financial dependence as contributing factors and the role of women in promoting marital harmony. Findings suggest that pre- and postmigration factors need to be considered in the prevention of IPV in newcomer communities. Adapted from the source document.

Pregnancy and Intimate Partner Violence: How Do Rural, Low-Income Women Cope

Author: Bhandari, Shreya1; Bullock, Linda F C; Anderson, Kim M; Danis, Fran S; Sharps, Phyllis W1 Department of Social Work, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023029447?accountid=14925

Abstract: We conducted 32 in-depth interviews with 20 rural, low-income, women residing in the United States who were pregnant (n = 12) or 3 months postpartum (n = 8) and had experienced intimate partner violence (IPV). Using purposive sampling and the grounded theory method, we generated a conceptual model of coping. The urge to protect the unborn baby was the primary influence for participants' decisions about separating from or permanently leaving an abusive relationship. Implications include universal screening for IPV in child-bearing women, inquiry into maternal identity development during pregnancy, and improved resource access for rural, low-income women. Adapted from the source document.

Normalizing Policies of Inaction-The Case of Health Care in Australia for Women Affected by Domestic Violence

Author: Tower, Marion1; Rowe, Jennifer; Wallis, Marianne1 Department of Nursing & Midwifery, Griffith University, Nathan, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023029408?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence impacts on all aspects of affected women's lives and results in poor general, reproductive, and psychological health (World Health Organisation, 2010). Despite mounting evidence that current health care responses to women affected by domestic violence are problematic, policies have nevertheless been rolled out without addressing issues identified. Funding cuts, fragmentation of services, and failure to establish good practice has resulted in a discourse where women's needs are pushed to the outside and they are marginalized, lost in the language and discourse of policy, normalizing a discourse of incompletion at policy and bureaucracy levels. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence Among Pregnant and Parenting Latina Adolescents

Author: Newman, Bernie Sue1; Campbell, Caroline1 Temple University School of Social Work bnewman@temple.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919904227?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the nature and extent of mutual violence among a sample of pregnant and parenting Latina adolescent females and their partners. The sample consisted of 73 Latina adolescent females between the ages of 14 and 20 who were referred to a community-based organization for case management, education, and psychosocial support for pregnant and parenting adolescents. They completed the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS-2) as part of a pretest to evaluate this intervention program. A small number (12 out of 73; 16%) reported no use of aggressive conflict tactics. Eighty-four percent (61 out of 73) of the study respondents reported using at least one form of minor psychological aggression and 62% (45 out of 73) reported using at least one form of minor physical assault over the past 6 months. Mutuality of conflict was high, especially in cases of minor assault by partner. There was no difference in severity or chronicity of conflict between those who were pregnant and those who were not. Female respondents reported that they and their partners engaged in comparable levels of sexual coercion. Discussion of the context of psychological, physical, and sexual aggression in adolescent relationships suggests alternative approaches to prevention of intimate partner violence among adolescents.

The Association Between Impulsivity, Trait Anger, and the Perpetration of Intimate Partner and General Violence Among Women Arrested for Domestic Violence

Author: Shorey, Ryan C1; Brasfield, Hope; Febres, Jeniimarie; Stuart, Gregory L1 University of Tennessee rshorey@utk.edu

Abstract: The problem of domestic violence is widespread, with research indicating men and women both perpetrate a substantial amount of aggression. However, aggression perpetrated by women is a relatively understudied area compared to aggression perpetrated by men. Additionally, research is needed to determine the correlates of aggression perpetration among women, as this can inform more effective treatment programs. Thus, the current study sought to examine the association between trait anger and impulsivity and the perpetration of physical and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) and general aggression among women arrested for domestic violence (N = 80). Findings indicated that both trait anger and impulsivity were significantly associated with aggression perpetration and trait anger mediated the relationship between impulsivity and aggression perpetration. Directions for future research and violence intervention programs are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Gender Differences in Risk for Intimate Partner Violence Among South African Adults

Author: Gass, Jesse D1; Stein, Dan J; Williams, David R; Seedat, Soraya1 Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919903456?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite a high prevalence of intimate partner violence in South Africa, few epidemiological studies have assessed individual risk factors and differential vulnerability by gender. This study seeks to analyze gender differences in risk for intimate partner violence victimization and perpetration according to childhood and adult risk factors in a national sample of South African men and women. Using data from the cross-sectional, nationally representative South Africa Stress and Health Study, the authors examine data from 1,715 currently married or cohabiting adults on reporting of intimate partner violence. Our analysis include (a) demographic factors, (b) early life risk factors (including exposure to childhood physical abuse, witnessing parental violence, parental closeness, and early onset DSM-IV disorders), and (c) adult risk factors (including experiencing the death of a child and episodes of DSM-IV disorders after age 20). Although prevalence rates of intimate partner violence are high among both genders, women are significantly more likely than men to report being victimized (29.3% vs. 20.9%). Rates of perpetrating violence are similar for women and men (25.2% and 26.5%, respectively). Men are more likely to report predictive factors for perpetration, whereas women are more likely to report predictors for victimization. Common risk factors among men and women reporting perpetration include exposure to childhood physical abuse, witnessing parental violence, and adult onset alcohol abuse/dependence. However, risk factors in male perpetrators are more likely to include cohabitation, low income, and early and adult-onset mood disorders, whereas risk factors in female perpetrators include low educational attainment and early onset alcohol abuse/dependence. The single common risk factor for male and female victims of partner violence is witnessing parental violence. Additional risk factors for male victims are low income and lack of closeness to a primary female caregiver, whereas additional risk factors for female victims are low educational attainment, childhood physical abuse, and adult onset alcohol abuse/dependence and intermittent explosive disorder. Intimate partner violence is a significant public health issue in South Africa, strongly linked to intergenerational cycling of violence and risk exposure across the life course. These findings indicate that gender differences in risk and common predictive factors, such as alcohol abuse and exposure to childhood violence, should inform the design of future violence-prevention programs and policies.

A Summary and Analysis of Warrantless Arrest Statutes for Domestic Violence in the United States

Author: Zeoli, April M1; Norris, Alexis; Brenner, Hannah1 Michigan State University, East Lansing zeoli@msu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919903997?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the United States, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes that allow police officers to make warrantless arrests for domestic violence given probable cause; however, state laws differ from one another in multiple, important ways. Research on domestic violence warrantless arrest laws rarely describe them as anything more than discretionary, preferred, or mandatory, either within their analyses or within the texts of their publications; researchers, and their audiences, may not be aware of the vast and potentially important differences among these laws. In this article, we list the domestic violence warrantless arrest laws for each state, and discuss them in terms of five common elements: the phrasing of the arrest authority; whether additional factors to domestic violence are required to trigger the arrest authority; qualifications to the arrest authority; time limits for warrantless arrest to occur; and whether police officers are required to report why they made a dual or no arrest. We then analyze the common elements of the laws, paying particular attention to how they may encourage or discourage the arrest of alleged domestic violence perpetrators. It is critical that researchers, advocates, and policymakers are aware of these variations in state statutes when conducting or interpreting research or making policy recommendations.

Reactions to Participating in Dating Violence Research: Are Our Questions Distressing Participants

Author: Shorey, Ryan C1; Cornelius, Tara L; Bell, Kathryn M1 University of Tennessee, Knoxville rshorey@utk.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919904261?accountid=14925

Abstract: In recent years, there has been increased research focus on dating violence, producing important information for reducing these violent relationships. Yet Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are often hesitant to approve research on dating violence, citing emotional distress of participants as a possible risk of participation. However, no known research has examined the reactions of research participants to questions about dating violence. The current study examined the reactions among college students to completing a self-report measure on dating violence. Results showed that participants reported numerous positive experiences as a result of their research participation, with only mildly increased negative emotional reactions evident for some. Findings are discussed in relation to IRB proposals and appropriate informed consent for research participants. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Older Women and Intimate Partner Violence: Effective Interventions

Author: Tetterton, Summer1; Farnsworth, Elizabeth1 Bedford Domestic Violence Services, Bedford, VA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919904008?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women above the age of 60 who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) have specific needs compared with younger victims. More research is emerging that assists counselors and other helping professionals with identification of these needs and aids to promote the mental health and well-being of this population. Professionals must consider the generational values held by older IPV victims and understand how values may impact decision making. Integrating safety planning and risk assessment into the counseling process is vital. Older IPV victims may seek counseling for posttraumatic stress or depressive symptoms as a result of the abuse. Others may participate in counseling for issues unrelated to IPV. Therefore, a thorough assessment process should include questions related to relationship dynamics so that the counselor has a complete understanding of all factors impacting the client's functioning. Helping professionals must also have an understanding of available community resources, as well as barriers that these clients face as they take steps toward recovery from trauma. This research uses qualitative analysis of case studies to assist helping professionals in understanding the most effective interventions when working with this population. We found that a contextual approach focusing on the restoration of self-confidence is a constructive means of initiating recovery from trauma.

Attitudes toward dating violence among Israeli and Thai youth

Author: Pradubmook-Sherer, Penchan; Sherer, Moshe11 Mahidol University, Thailand

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/894670570?accountid=14925

Abstract: The objectives of this research were to assess the prevailness and severity of attitudes toward dating violence among Jewish, Arabs, and Thai male and female adolescents. The random samples consisted 9th to12th grade pupils. The study assessed attitudes toward psychological, physical, and sexual dating violence. Jewish youth reflected lower endorsement of dating violence than Thai and Arab participants. The Thai youths held the highest support toward dating violence, with no difference between the Thai and Arab youths on psychological attitudes toward dating violence. While females reported less endorsement of dating violence than males, differences among the three female subgroups on attitudes toward dating violence were indicated. The discussion focuses on explanations for the differences between the three ethno cultural groups and genders, and presents the theoretical and practical implications of the study.

The Evolution of a Children's Domestic Violence Counseling Group: Stages and Processes

Author: Thompson, E Heather11 Western Carolina University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964197233?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this qualitative case study is to illuminate the lived experiences of 4 young children between 6 and 7 years old who witnessed domestic violence while revealing the complex relationship between group process and stage development in their 18-week counseling group. Data revealed that processes occurring between and among group members shaped the evolution of the counseling group through a series of stages that are similar to those seen in adult counseling groups. The data also revealed developmental differences between group processes occurring between these young members and the ways in which group processes unfold in adult counseling groups. Adapted from the source document.

Mothers-in-law against daughters-in-law: Domestic violence and legal discourses around mother-in-law violence against daughters-in-law in India

Author: Gangoli, Geetanjali1; Rew, Martin1 Centre for Gender and Violence Research, School for Policy Studies, 8 Priory Road, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037880922?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper focuses on acts of domestic violence perpetuated against women by their mothers-in-law in India. Specifically, it attempts to unpack legislative and legal discourses surrounding these crimes in order to understand how such violence is conceptualised within the Indian justice system. In India, such cases are tried under domestic violence laws. However, legal understandings conceptualise mother-in-law perpetrated violence as intra-women relational conflict between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law or dowry related, rather than as a form of gender based violence against women. Conviction rates for domestic violence remain low, and there are numerous allegations of legal malfeasance and abuse surrounding such incidents. In this paper we explore whether the problem lies in the implementation of a good law or if, following Foucault, whether the law itself is a form of negative patriarchal power which limits the ability of women to receive justice. Further, we argue that the problems faced by some Indian feminists to engage with mother-in-law violence as an integral part of domestic violence may have allowed highly patriarchal understandings of such violence to predominate in legislative and legal discourses.

From victims of domestic violence to determined independent women: How Vietnamese immigrant spouses negotiate Taiwan's patriarchy family system

Author: Tang, Wen-hui Anna1; Wang, Hong-zen1 Department of Sociology, National Sun Vat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037880929?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using interview data from 16 abused Vietnamese transnational wives and 6 male abusers in Taiwan, this paper seeks to understand how these immigrant women negotiate the Taiwanese patriarchal family system, and in the end empower themselves to find ways out of the shadow of domestic violence. We contend that the women's relationships with the patriarchal families are constantly changing in different structures and time-frames, and we delineate the dynamic social process experienced by these immigrant women. Employment, together with other advantageous structural factors, was important to the changes in their relationships with their husbands' families. Taiwan's state intervention in the Domestic Violence Prevention Act as well as in influencing the economic structure based on flexible small- and medium-sized enterprises are beneficial factors which help women leave unhappy marriages. Our paper argues that it is only through this dynamic negotiation process can we avoid the pitfall of portraying them as victimized, poor and miserable. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

"I made her realise that I could be there for her, that I could support her": Child Protection Practices with Women in Domestic Violence Cases

Author: Lapierre, Simon; Cote, Isabelle

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023031561?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents findings from a study that investigated child protection policies and practices, and focuses on data gathered in a child protection agency located in Quebec, Canada. This research project draws upon a qualitative case-study methodology, involving a documentary analysis of both national and local child protection policies, as well as semi-structured individual interviews with child protection front-line workers and front-line managers, managers and reviewing officers. Although the dominant pattern that emerged in the data suggests that child protection workers tend to focus on abused women's actions and to blame them for "failing to protect" their children, this article emphasises practices where the research participants had managed to avoid mother-blaming when working with these women. Indeed, the findings suggest that child protection workers can avoid mother-blaming when working with abused women, despite shortfalls in policies, procedures and resources. Such practices include recognising that there are two victims in domestic violence situations, building a trusting relationship, providing emotional and practical support, and balancing risk and safety. These four dimensions are interrelated and they all require a clear identification of domestic violence, as well as a good understanding of the problem and its impacts. To emphasise individual workers' positive practices with women in domestic violence situations should not be used to minimise the importance of more structural changes in child protection policies and practices. This would include challenging the tendency to focus on women and finding more effective ways to engage with abusive men throughout child protection procedures in order to challenge their violent behaviours. However, it could lead to an approach that is more sensitive to domestic violence and that has the potential to alleviate the workers' feelings of powerlessness and frustration in relation to their work with families where there has been domestic violence.

Child-to-parent Violence: Challenging Perspectives on Family Violence

Author: Coogan, Declan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023031565?accountid=14925

Abstract: Until relatively recently, the focus of research, policy and intervention responses to abuse and violence within families has been almost exclusively on the behaviour of adults rather than on the violence within families carried out by children and adolescents. As a consequence, the aggressive and violent behaviour of children and adolescents at home has received scant attention in practice, policy and research literature and this form of family violence remains poorly understood. This paper aims to broaden discussions about violence and abuse in families by examining the use of violence by children and young people at home towards parents through a review of the relevant literature. Dilemmas of definition will be explored, including distinctions between abusive behaviour and what could be termed as "normal" conflict between parents and their children during adolescence. Social and cultural factors contributing to the lack of attention to child-to-parent violence will be explored. The "Tackling Violence at Home" Strategy in Northern Ireland and the "National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence 2010-2014" in the Republic of Ireland will be examined for policy and practice guidance in relation to child-to-parent violence. It will be suggested that conventional social and cultural assumptions in relation to children, power and violence within families lead to challenges in the detection and development of effective responses to child-to-parent violence. Attention will also be drawn to the potential that may lie within established domestic violence frameworks for policy and practice development and to promising research and practice interventions.

Women's Refuges as Intervention Arenas for Children who Experience Domestic Violence

Author: Overlien, Carolina

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023031569?accountid=14925

Abstract: For over 30 years, children have been accompanying their mothers to women's refuges. We now know that these children are at risk of developing an array of behavioural and psychological difficulties. We also know the importance for children of keeping active and playing while at the refuge, and to be given the possibility of addressing and dealing with their own experiences of violence. However, we know very little about how children experience these interventions. This study analyses children's discourse about their everyday lives at refuges in Norway. The questions asked are: what interventions do children in refuges in Norway receive and how do the children experience those interventions? The analysis shows that the children focus on two forms of interventions as particularly helpful, activities (trips, "outings", and so on) and individual counselling. Furthermore, as the most important intervention for a child who experiences domestic violence is to remove him/her from a seriously violent environment, the refuge stay in itself can be perceived as an intervention. In the discussion, the author describes how and why refuges represent a unique opportunity for interventions with children. Adapted from the source document.

Perspectives on US Domestic Violence Emergency Shelters: What Do Young Adolescent Residents and their Mothers Say?

Author: Chanmugam, Amy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023031570?accountid=14925

Abstract: As part of a larger qualitative study using Life Story methods, an ethnically diverse, purposive sample (n = 27) of young adolescents (ages 12-14) and their mothers residing in four US domestic violence emergency shelters were interviewed about their perspectives of shelter life. Youth reported aspects they liked, most often expressing that they liked other families residing in the shelter. More than one-half expressed disliking shelter rules restricting their behaviour. Mothers expressed positive feelings about the shelters overall. They emphasised the package of services received, safety, the shelter's effectiveness in meeting their needs, and positive interactions with personnel. Mothers' most frequently suggested improvement was for more space and services for children and youth. Results of youth and mother interviews are contextualised by descriptions of the shelters they resided in, based on interviews with personnel at each shelter. This article discusses findings within developmental and human rights frameworks, considering participant views in terms of normative adolescent development and non-normative histories of violence exposure and residential instability, while highlighting the human rights-informed value of youth perspectives for research, programme development, and youth development. It discusses implications for research and practice, with recommendations for developing shelter environments, programmes and policies responsive to young adolescent residents. Adapted from the source document.

The Relationship Between Self-Control, Witnessing Domestic Violence, and Subsequent Violence

Author: Payne, Brian K1; Triplett, Ruth A; Higgins, George E1 Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023029319?accountid=14925

Abstract: The notion that violence begets violence is well accepted. Less clear are the precise factors that link together child violence and adult violence in an individual's life course. This study examines the role that self-control has in linking together exposure to violence in a child's life and subsequent violence in that individual's life. A telephone survey with 375 residents in Southeastern Virginia was conducted. Attention is given to whether those who saw their parents fight are more likely to (1) have a low self-control and (2) report having experienced violence either as an offender or a victim. Results suggest that witnessing violence is not related to self-control, and those who witnessed violence were less likely to have subsequent experiences with partner abuse. Further, we found that low self-control has a link with partner abuse. Implications for theory, policy, and future research are provided. Adapted from the source document.

Losing out on both counts: disabled women and domestic violence

Author: Thiara, Ravi K1; Hague, Gill; Mullender, Audrey1 Centre for the Study of Safety and Well-being, School of Health and Social Studies, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023029551?accountid=14925

Abstract: The links between disability and domestic violence have been under-examined to date, leading to the marginalisation of disabled women affected by domestic violence in theory, politics, and practice. This paper draws on the findings from the first national study in the United Kingdom of the needs of disabled women experiencing domestic violence and of the services available to meet these needs. Utilising the concept of intersectionality to locate abused disabled women along axes of oppression/domination, the paper highlights the complex nature of women's abuse experiences as well as the inadequacy of professional responses which leave women without support and protection. Adapted from the source document.

Seeking Help for Intimate Partner Violence: Victims' Experiences When Approaching the Criminal Justice System for IPV-Related Support and Protection in an Australian Jurisdiction

Author: Meyer, Silke11 University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, s.meyer@uq.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/908768937?accountid=14925

Abstract: The criminal justice system (CJS) frequently encounters victims of intimate partner violence (IPV). Despite these frequent encounters, professionals in the CJS often fail to adequately address victims' needs. The experiences of female IPV victims (N = 29) who approached the CJS in Southeast Queensland, Australia for support and protection are examined throughout this article. Findings from the in-depth interviews reveal that women often face stereotypical and victim-blaming attitudes despite an existing policy environment that promotes victim protection and offender accountability. Implications for policy and practice are discussed

Linkages Between Gender Equity and Intimate Partner Violence Among Urban Brazilian Youth

Author: Gomez, Anu Manchikanti1; Speizer, Ilene S; Moracco, Kathryn E1 Center for Research on Gender and Sexuality, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California anugomez@sfsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/907929531?accountid=14925

Abstract: Purpose: Gender inequity is a risk factor for intimate partner violence (IPV), although there is little research on this relationship that focuses on youth or males. Using survey data collected from 240 male and 198 female youth aged 15-24 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, we explore the association between individual-level support for gender equity and IPV experiences in the past 6 months and describe responses to and motivations for IPV. Methods: Factor analysis was used to construct gender equity scales for males and females. Logistic and multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between gender equity and IPV. Results: About half of female youth reported some form of recent IPV, including any victimization (32%), any perpetration (40%), and both victimization and perpetration (22%). A total of 18% of male youth reported recently perpetrating IPV. In logistic regression models, support for gender equity had a protective effect against any female IPV victimization and any male IPV perpetration and was not associated with female IPV perpetration. Female victims reported leaving the abusive partner, but later returning to him as the most frequent response to IPV. Male perpetrators said the most common response of their victims was to retaliate with violence. Jealousy was the most frequently reported motivation of females perpetrating IPV. Conclusion: Gender equity is an important predictor of IPV among youth. Examining the gendered context of IPV will be useful in the development of targeted interventions to promote gender equity and healthy relationships and to help reduce IPV among youth.

Enduring vulnerabilities, relationship attributions, and couple conflict: An integrative model of the occurrence and frequency of intimate partner violence.

Author: Marshall, Amy D1; Jones, Damon E; Feinberg, Mark E1 Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University amymarshall@psu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023026304?accountid=14925

Abstract: We tested an integrative model of individual and dyadic variables contributing to intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration. Based on the vulnerability-stress-adaptation (VSA) model, we hypothesized that three "enduring vulnerabilities" (i.e., antisocial behavior, hostility, and depressive symptoms) would be associated with a "maladaptive process" (i.e., negative relationship attributions) that would lead to difficulties in couple conflict resolution, thus leading to IPV. Among a community sample of 167 heterosexual couples who were expecting their first child, we used an actor-partner interdependence model to account for the dyadic nature of conflict and IPV, as well as a hurdle count model to improve upon prior methods for modeling IPV data. Study results provided general support for the integrative model, demonstrating the importance of considering couple conflict in the prediction of IPV and showing the relative importance of multiple predictor variables. Gender symmetry was observed for the prediction of IPV occurrence, with gender differences emerging in the prediction of IPV frequency. Relatively speaking, the prediction of IPV frequency appeared to be a function of enduring vulnerabilities among men, but a function of couple conflict among women. Results also revealed important cross-gender effects in the prediction of IPV, reflecting the inherently dyadic nature of IPV, particularly in the case of "common couple violence." Future research using longitudinal designs is necessary to verify the conclusions suggested by the current results. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

Author: Antle, Becky F1; Karam, Eli; Christensen, Dana N; Barbee, Anita P; Sar, Bibhuti K1 Marriage and Family Therapy Program, Kent School of Social Work, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1266148566?accountid=14925

Abstract: This research evaluated the impact of the Within My Reach healthy relationship education program on intimate partner violence for 419 high-risk adults in an urban area. Key outcomes such as relationship knowledge, communication/conflict resolution skills, relationship quality, and physical and emotional abuse were evaluated through survey research immediately post- and 6-months postprogram participation. Results suggest that participation in the Within My Reach program is associated with a statistically significant decrease in physical and emotional abuse, as well as isolation behaviors. Differences by participant demographics and the role of communication skills and relationship quality as mediators of these outcomes are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Internalized Sexual Minority Stressors and Same-Sex Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Carvalho, Amana F; Lewis, Robin J1; Derlega, Valerian J1; Winstead, Barbara A1; Viggiano, Claudia11 Psychology Department, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, 23529-0267, USA, rlewis@odu.edu; rlewis@odu.edu; rlewis@odu.edu; rlewis@odu.edu

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious problem in both same-sex and heterosexual relationships. Although there are numerous similarities in the dynamics of IPV, gay men and lesbians experience unique stressors related to their sexual minority status. This preliminary, descriptive study examined the relationship among internalized homophobia, stigma consciousness, and openness to self-reported IPV victimization and perpetration. Among 581 men and lesbians, approximately one-quarter reported IPV victimization and almost 10% reported IPV perpetration. When demographic variables of age, sex of participant, and relationship status were controlled, victims of IPV reported greater expectations of prejudice and discrimination, yet were more open about their sexual orientation. Similarly, expectations of prejudice and discrimination were related to IPV perpetration. As researchers and counselors focus on understanding, and ultimately reducing, same-sex IPV, it is imperative that sexual minority stressors are considered.

Psychosocial Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Exposure in Maltreated Adolescents: Assessing More than IPV Occurrence

Author: Garrido, Edward F; Culhane, Sara E1; Petrenko, Christie LM1; Taussig, Heather N11 Department of Pediatrics, Kempe Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/913786023?accountid=14925

Abstract: The majority of research on the psychosocial impact of intimate partner violence (IPV) exposure for children has focused on IPV occurrence. The current study extended this research by examining three dimensions of IPV exposure: frequency, proximity, and severity, and tested whether these dimensions predicted variance in adolescents' psychosocial problems over-and-above that accounted for by IPV occurrence. Participants included 140 adolescents and their caregivers, who were recruited for an intervention involving maltreated youth placed in out-of-home care. After controlling for IPV occurrence, exposure to community violence, and severity of maltreatment, results indicated a positive association between the multidimensional IPV index and youth report of psychosocial problems. There was also a trend for a positive association between the IPV index and caregiver report of psychosocial problems for boys. The study's results are discussed in terms of their implications for prevention researchers and child welfare agencies.

Abstract: This work examines the moderator effect of sex and age on the relationship between different types of exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) and child psychopathology and functional impairment. One hundred and sixty-six Spanish children aged 4-17 years exposed to intimate partner violence were assessed using a diagnostic interview and other instruments for the measurement of psychopathology and functional impairment. Participants were classified in three groups according to the degree of exposure: witness (N=77), involved (N=63) and victim (N=26). According to mothers' self-reports and mother-child combined information, boy victims of IPV showed more mood disorders than involved or witness boys. There were no other moderator effects of either sex or age. The effect of exposure to intimate partner violence among children was not dependent, in general, on the child's sex or age, and this has important implications for the assessment, treatment, and prevention of children's exposure to IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Typologies of Intimate Partner Violence: Evaluation of a Screening Instrument for Differentiation

Abstract: Given the prevalence and impact of intimate partner violence (IPV) in both community and therapeutic settings, it is vital that the varying typologies of IPV be identified and treated accordingly. The present study sought to evaluate the efficacy of a screening instrument designed to differentiate between characterologically violent, situationally violent, and distressed non-violent couples; focus was placed on identifying situationally violent couples so that they could be invited to participate in a conjoint pyschoeducational workshop. Couples from two samples were assessed to achieve this goal. Situationally violent couples (N=115) from Sample 1 were screened into the study via a phone interview and participated in an in-home assessment, which assessed self-reported relationship violence. These couples were compared to a previously collected sample (Sample 2; Jacobsen et al. 1994) of characterologically violent, distressed non-violent, and situationally violent couples. The main hypotheses stated that couples from Sample 1 would report less severe relationship violence than characterlogically violent couples from Sample 2, and would report greater amounts of low-level violence than distressed non-violent couples from Sample 2. Additionally, similar rates of both self-reported violence would be seen for situationally violent couples from Samples 1 and 2. Multivariate analyses supported this with the exception that situationally violent couples from Sample 1 did not differ significantly across all domains from distressed non-violent couples in Sample 2. Implications for the screening instrument's utility in clinical and research settings are discussed.

The Sexual Victimization of Women: Substance Abuse, HIV, Prostitution, and Intimate Partner Violence as Underlying Correlates

Author: Taylor, Ozietta D11 Department of Applied Psychology and Rehabilitation Counseling, Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283640279?accountid=14925

Abstract: The sexual victimization of women has lifelong effects that can manifest in the forms of substance abuse, the human immunodeficiency virus, prostitution, intimate partner abuse, and an array of psychological disorders. An examination of the correlates of sexual assault revealed that the victims of this crime are in need of therapeutic interventions to alleviate or eradicate the symptoms associated with the posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. Further, treatment services are needed to address the physiological and psychological symptoms of substance use disorders and intimate partner violence, while medical interventions are required for women affected with HIV.

Domestic Violence During Pregnancy in India

Author: Mahapatro, Meerambika1; Gupta, R N; Gupta, Vinay; Kundu, A S1 National Institute of Health & Family Welfare, New Delhi, India meerambika@rediffmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919904527?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence can result in many negative health consequences for women's health and well-being. Studies on domestic violence illustrate that abused women in various settings had increased health problems such as injury, chronic pain, gastrointestinal, and gynecological signs including sexually transmitted diseases, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. This article tries to understand the association between domestic violence and pregnancy outcomes and other health consequences. The study was carried out in all the six zones of India that is, northern, southern, eastern, western, central, and northeast zones. The study design was conceived as an analytical cross sectional study with multicenter approach. Multistage sampling and then probability proportion to size (PPS) sampling were done. A total of 18 states were taken for the study with a total sample of 14,507 married women and 14,108 married men. Married men were considered from the neighboring villages to understand men's perspective. To understand the situation, women were interviewed using semistructured questionnaire as well as qualitative data like FGD and case studies. The result shows that domestic violence occurs during pregnancy across six zones. The situations become worse for women if her husband or family perceived the pregnancy to be a female child and there is a demand for male child. It has major health implications in accessing and utilizing antenatal care and immunization. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Unraveling the Relative Contributions of His, Her, and Their Drinking to the Likelihood of Arrest in Intimate Partner Violence Cases

Author: Hirschel, David1; Hutchison, Ira1 University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell josephdavid@msn.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919904652?accountid=14925

Abstract: The nexus between substance abuse and intimate partner violence has been studied in depth. The interrelationship between drinking, intimate partner violence, and an officer's decision to make an arrest has not received as much attention. The issue is complicated by the fact that either or both of the involved parties may have been drinking and the effects may vary depending on who has been drinking. In this article, the authors examine the relative contributions of his, her, and their drinking to the likelihood of arrest. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Children's Exposure to Intimate Partner Violence in Alberta, Canada: The Construction of a Policy Problem

Author: Nixon, Kendra L11 University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023027846?accountid=14925

Abstract: Children's exposure to violence in the home has been a major issue for policy makers worldwide. The study examines how child protection policy makers in one Canadian province represent the problem of children's exposure. The current policy representation is problematic because it locates the problem within the broader framework of family violence. By doing so, policy makers equate the violence that mothers experience with other forms of violence in the home, and degender the violence that children are exposed to. Such policy representations may not be effective in protecting children and their mothers. These themes and the implications for policy are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Trapped in the Cycle of Violence: A Phenomenological Study Describing the Stages of Coping with Domestic Violence

Author: Davhana-Maselesele, Mashudu11 Faculty of Agriculture, Science and Technology, North-West University (Mafikeng Campus) Mmabatho, South Africa Mashudu.maselesele@nwu.ac.za

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1018351810?accountid=14925

Abstract: One of the most persistent maladies of domestic violence is that its victims are always blamed, even by trusted sources of social capital support, for staying in an abusive relationship. Questions as to why the woman victim does not leave are always asked, and most often women are blamed for continuing to stay. This brings to the fore the question of their coping strategies as it relates to abusive partners. This paper specifically examines how women go through and cope with domestic violence. A qualitative descriptive, exploratory and contextual study was conducted with women who are victims of domestic violence. Phenomenological interviews were conducted with women who volunteered to participate in the study. A sample was purposively selected of women who were staying with their abusive partners, tolerating abusive relationship for a period of more than 20 years. Ethical measures were adhered to bearing in mind the sensitivity of this research. Findings revealed six stages of coping which abused women go through as they ride on what was become known as the Walkers' Cycle of Violence. It is important to understand the world that a victim of domestic violence lives in, and the paces they take, so as to be able to understand her and be able to provide the necessary support without being judgemental. Ultimately, empowerment strategies, as opposed to run-of-the-mill 'holistic approaches', are recommended for redeeming the victim's lot and redirecting the survivor's coping skills beyond institutional intervention.

Intimate Partner Violence Survivors' Unmet Social Service Needs

Author: Dichter, Melissa E1; Rhodes, Karin V1 Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion, Philadelphia VA Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283642192?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization are at risk for physical and mental health problems, as well as social and economic challenges. In this cross-sectional study, 173 adult, English-speaking women who had experienced police response to IPV completed a self-report questionnaire about their use of, interest in, and need for various social services and whether or not each type of service helped (or would help) them to feel safer. More than three quarters of the participants reported a current need for health and economic support services. There was less interest in traditional IPV resources: law enforcement and domestic violence counseling or shelter. Expanding services to meet survivors' needs for health care and economic independence may facilitate long-term safety. Recommendations for further research in this area are provided.

An Ecological Synthesis of Research on Older Women's Experiences of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Weeks, Lori E1; LeBlanc, Kristal1 Department of Family & Nutritional Sciences, University of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown, PEI, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283641559?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this systematic literature review, we synthesized the current knowledge of intimate partner violence experienced by older women. We identified 32 studies that included data collected from older women and synthesized the findings using the ecological model as an organizing framework. Themes in the microsystem included the immediate context in which the abuse takes place and impacts on older women. The mesosystem included themes on the older woman's relationships with her social network. Themes in the exosystem encompassed community-based services. Finally, themes in the macrosystem encompassed broad ideologies, mores, and influences of the geographic location. We used the ecological model to frame a discussion of implications for future research, policy, and practice. Adapted from the source document.

Role Of School In Detecting The Exposure Of Children To Domestic Violence

Author: Protner, Ksenija Domiter11 First Grammar School Maribor and is a doctoral student in Sociology, Faculty of Art, University of Maribor ksenija.protner@guest.arnes.si

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1018352135?accountid=14925

Abstract: In recent decades, the scale and complexity of the exposure of children to domestic violence have been increasingly evident, and accordingly, many different disciplines have been paying growing attention to it. However, numerous cases of such violence still remain hidden. Slovene cultural environment, characterized by a high respect of family privacy, is marked by a rather stereotyped conception of family as a safe and loving community, making it harder to detect, and react properly to, cases of domestic violence. In the article, a short overview of characteristics, forms, and different consequences of the exposure of children to domestic violence is presented. Opportunities and limitations in detecting signs of domestic violence in school environment are described. It is argued that school professional staff (counsellors and teachers) should be well trained and supported to be able to cope with domestic violence. Also, an interinstitutional approach to solving this problem is strongly advocated. Adapted from the source document.

The Influence of Spirituality on Service Utilization and Satisfaction for Women Residing in a Domestic Violence Shelter

Author: Fowler, Dawnovise N1; Faulkner, Monica; Learman, Joy; Runnels, Ratonia1 Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/915435812?accountid=14925

Abstract: Little is known about the influence of spirituality on service utilization and satisfaction among women survivors of intimate partner abuse (IPA). The purpose of this study was to examine differences between shelter and faith-based service utilization and satisfaction in a shelter sample (N = 73). Multiple regression techniques were used. The findings suggest that survivors with higher spirituality were more likely to utilize faith-based resources than shelters. Those who experienced greater IPA reported dissatisfaction with faith-based resources. These results suggest that spirituality should be incorporated into shelter services to meet survivors' spiritual needs, and faith-based services should adequately address IPA.

Legislating Gender Inequalities: The Nature and Patterns of Domestic Violence Experienced by South Asian Women With Insecure Immigration Status in the United Kingdom

Author: Anitha, Sundari11 University of Lincoln, Lincoln, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/915415604?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on domestic violence documents the particular vulnerability of immigrant women due to reasons including social isolation, language barriers, lack of awareness about services, and racism on the part of services. Based on qualitative interviews with 30 South Asian women with insecure immigration status residing in Yorkshire and Northwest England, this article explores how inequalities created by culture, gender, class, and race intersect with state immigration and welfare policies in the United Kingdom, thereby exacerbating structures of patriarchy within minority communities. It is within these contexts that South Asian women with insecure immigration status experience intensified forms and specific patterns of abuse.

Suicidal Ideation and the Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Rural Western China

Author: Yanqiu, Gao1; Yan, Wang; Lin, An1 Peking University Health Sciences Center, Beijing, China

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/915415713?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the extent of the association between intimate partner violence (IPV) and suicidal ideation in a rural county in Western China. A sample of 1,771 women participated in the study. The lifetime prevalence of physical assault, psychological aggression, and sexual coercion was 34%, 68%, and 4%, respectively. The preceding-year prevalence of physical assault and psychological aggression was 8% and 32%, respectively. The prevalence of lifetime suicidal ideation was 15.9%, and 3.3% of the women had suicidal ideation during the preceding week. Physical abuse victims were at more than four times greater risk of having suicidal ideation than those who had not suffered physical assault.

Women's Expectations of Healthcare Professionals in Case of Intimate Partner Violence in Serbia

Author: Djikanovic, Bosiljka1; Wong, Sylvie Lo Fo; Stevanovic, Snezana; Celik, Halime; Lagro-Janssen, Antoine1 University of Belgrade, School of Medicine, Institute of Social Medicine, Belgrade, Serbia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283639642?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women who have experienced intimate partner violence use health care services more often than non-abused women, but it is unclear what they expect from physicians in relation to their intimate partner violence experience. In this study the authors explored whether women in Serbia expect physicians to help them after having experienced intimate partner violence, what kind of help the women expected, and if none, why none is expected. The authors of this study conducted structured interviews with 120 women who visited six primary healthcare centres. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, while qualitative data were analyzed applying content analyses. The majority of women (81.7%) expected healthcare professionals to help them in the event of intimate partner violence, mainly through giving advice, information, contacting other institutions, services, and providing understanding and support. Fewer women expected help in the form of documenting violence and contacting police. Only a minority (8.3%) did not expect help, noting that intimate partner violence is beyond the scope of healthcare professionals' interest or competencies, and/or that violence was a private problem, while 10% were unsure about the role of physicians in the case of intimate partner violence. The majority of women in this study expected help with intimate partner violence. Physicians should be aware of these expectations and how to provide support to women experiencing intimate partner violence. Adapted from the source document.

Deadly Love: Images of Dating Violence in the "Twilight Saga"

Author: Collins, Victoria E1; Carmody, Dianne C1 Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA, vcollins@odu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919407678?accountid=14925

Abstract: It has been well established that adolescents face a high risk of dating violence in the United States. One explanation links these behaviors to attitudes and behaviors that are reflected in the media, such as books, movies, and video games that target a teenage audience. In the study presented here, a content analysis of the popular four-book Twilight series provided evidence of behaviors and attitudes that are conducive to dating violence. Cases of physical and sexual abuse, stalking, threats, and intimidation were identified in the text. Given that this book series has been praised for its "wholesome" presentation of teenage romance, these are troubling findings. Implications include the use of the Twilight series in social work, education, and violence prevention efforts.

History repeating: child protection responses to domestic violence

Author: Humphreys, Cathy1; Absler, Deborah1 Alfred Felton Chair of Child and Family Welfare

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964195568?accountid=14925

Abstract: Statutory child protection has a long and contested history in domestic violence intervention where children are involved. The inadequacy of the response has been raised by researchers, women and their advocates for more than 20 years. In fact, Linda Gordon, in her classic analysis of the files of charitable agencies from 1880 to 1960, showed that violent men were ignored, women whose own lives were in danger were judged as inadequate when they failed to protect their children and 'child rescue' was frequently seen as the solution to protecting vulnerable children. The same issues continue to be raised today. The repetitive pattern points to the structured nature of the problem which goes beyond the intentions and practice of individual workers. A policy response and a cultural change is needed, which tackles not only the 'age old' but also some of the newer permutations of intervention in this area. This paper will explore aspects of this structured pattern and then draw from international research and projects which are grappling with positive changes to child protection intervention in this area.

An Examination of Intimate Partner Violence and Psychological Stressors in Adult Abortion Patients

Author: Ely, Gretchen E1; Otis, Melanie D1 University of Kentucky, Lexington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964196649?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to describe an exploratory study examining the relationship between intimate partner violence and psychological stressors in a sample of 188 adult abortion patients. Results indicate the almost 15% of respondents report a history of abuse by the co-conceiving partner. In addition, women who reported having had one or more past abortions were more likely to also report that the person involved in the current pregnancy had also emotionally abused them. Women reporting one type of partner abuse were significantly more likely to also report other types of abuse. Women reporting abuse were less likely to report informing their co-conceiving partner of their appointment at the clinic, less likely to report that their partner contributed financially to the abortion cost, and more likely to report partner refusal to wear a condom. Women who reported emotional abuse were more likely to score higher on all but one of the psychological stressor scales. The implications of these findings are discussed.

The Assessment of Intimate Partner Violence in Spanish Women: The Index of Spouse Abuse

Author: Plazaola-Castano, Juncal1; Ruiz-Perez, Isabel; Escriba-Aguir, Vicenta; Montero-Pinar, Isabel; Vives-Cases, Carmen1 CIBER Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Spain

Abstract: We aimed to analyze the internal consistency and construct validity of the Spanish version of the Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA) in a representative sample of 8,995 women attending general practice in Spain in 2006-2007. The factor structure analysis shows that the ISA measures four intimate partner violence (IPV) dimensions: emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and controlling behavior. Cronbach alpha ranges from .82 (sexual factor) to .94 (emotional). Construct validity analysis shows that IPV is associated with poorer self-perceived health, higher psychological distress, and lower tangible social support. The ISA can help make more visible forms of gender violence in the intimate relationship that sometimes are not recognized as such, like sexual violence or controlling behavior. This can contribute to the development of specific interventions for women experiencing IPV, considering the specificities of the violent acts experienced.

Attitudes Toward Police Response to Domestic Violence: A Comparison of Chinese and American College Students

Author: Sun, Ivan Y1; Su, Mingyue; Wu, Yuning1 University of Delaware, Newark

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964196661?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence has emerged as a worldwide concern since the 1970s. Although a substantial amount of efforts have been devoted to assessing various aspects of domestic violence, a relatively small number of studies have empirically examined factors that shape public attitudes toward police response to such incidents. Even rarer is investigating the topic from an international, comparative perspective. Based on survey data gathered from approximately 550 college students in China and the United States, this study analyzes the effects of background characteristics, personal and vicarious experiences of crime, and perceptions of gender roles and violence on attitudes toward proactive and traditional police response to domestic violence. Compared to their American counterparts, Chinese students were less likely to favor proactive response and more likely to support traditional response. Chinese and American students' attitudes toward police response to domestic violence were shaped by some different and common factors. Implications for policy and future research are discussed.

Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Service Goal Priorities

Author: Macy, Rebecca J1; Johns, Natalie; Rizo, Cynthia F; Martin, Sandra L; Giattina, Mary1 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/964186097?accountid=14925

Abstract: We investigated agency directors' perspectives about how service goals should be prioritized for domestic violence and sexual assault service subtypes, including crisis, legal advocacy, medical advocacy, counseling, support group, and shelter services. A sample of 97 (94% response rate) North Carolina domestic violence and/or sexual assault agency directors completed a survey asking participants to rank the importance of service goals. Overall, participants considered emotional support provision to be a critical service goal priority across all service types. Social support and self-care service strategies were deemed less important. However, prioritization of other service goals varied depending on the service type. Statistically significant differences on service goal prioritization based on key agency characteristics were also examined, and agency characteristics were found to relate to differences in service goal prioritization.

Use of Nonmedical and Pediatric Primary Care Medical Services by Families Who Call Police for Domestic Violence-Related Issues

Author: Thomas-Taylor, Danielle1; Cerulli, Catherine1 Rochester General Hospital, Rochester, NY, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/922871634?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study considers domestic violence (DV) victims' court and social service utilization (n = 86). We next examine the victims' pediatric provider to explore pediatricians' roles in a community-based response to DV. Sixty-five percent of the sample who used DV-related services interacted with the pediatric community. Pediatric inner-city clinic-based patients appear in the welfare management system and child protective system at similar rates as private pediatric patients. However, clinic-based patients appear in family court more than privately based patients (91% vs. 57%). Data suggest that all pediatric providers should screen, assess, and refer parents for DV.

Bride-price and its links to domestic violence and poverty in Uganda: A participatory action research study

Author: Hague, Gill1; Thiara, Ravi K; Turner, Atuki1 University of Bristol, University of Warwick, and MIFUMI, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037881996?accountid=14925

Abstract: As a marriage rite, bride-price is commonly practiced in many African and other countries. While it has an on-going cultural longevity, the practice has been subjected to increased scrutiny by women's activists and academics concerned by its negative impacts on women and girls. Conceptualizing bride-price as a violence against women issue, this article reports on an innovative participatory action research study, carried out through an international collaboration, which sought to explore the links between bride-price, domestic violence and poverty and to lead to locally developed strategies for social change. The study found that bride-price was seen, overwhelmingly, to have mainly negative impacts on rural women and thus to require reform. In situations where domestic violence is common, bride-price introduces additional ways in which men can justify the abuse of women. The research clearly demonstrates that the commoditization of wives has led to deleterious social impacts, especially in terms of increased domestic violence and male power over women. The introduction of a gendered lens into conceptualizations of the practice and the ensuing campaigning and policy work, including this research, have been key to beginning the process of transforming views on bride-price.

Councils as Empowering Contexts: Mobilizing the Front Line to Foster Systems Change in the Response to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Javdani, Shabnam1; Allen, Nicole E1 Department of Psychology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 603 E. Daniel Street, Champaign, IL, 61820, USA, javdani2@illinois.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/922927494?accountid=14925

Abstract: Collaborative approaches to change are common, and though evidence for their effectiveness is equivocal, there is growing support that councils facilitate desired changes in the systems response to intimate partner violence. Questions remain regarding the specific mechanisms by which this change is facilitated, and recent work has focused on examining the intermediate processes through which councils may produce more distal change. One such mechanism relates to the potential of councils to be empowering contexts for their membership, often comprised of front-line providers and responders. The present study examines what factors are positively related to perceived individual empowerment as an outcome for members, and importantly, considers not only perceived council context, but also the perceived organizational contexts in which each council member is employed. Study findings suggest that both contexts-council and organizational-are important when considering the degree to which members are empowered. Specifically, member participation, council leadership, and supportive council and organizational climates are significantly positively related to the degree to which councils function as empowering contexts. However, the effect of belonging to a council with a supportive climate, characterized in particular by shared power in decision-making, is stronger when members are from high organizational support settings versus low support settings.

Desistance from Intimate Partner Violence: the Role of Legal Cynicism, Collective Efficacy, and Social Disorganization in Chicago Neighborhoods

Author: Emery, Clifton R1; Jolley, Jennifer M; Wu, Shali1 School of Social Welfare, Yonsei University, 262 Seongsanno, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, South Korea, cemery@yonsei.ac.kr

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/922899156?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examined the relationship between reported Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) desistance and neighborhood concentrated disadvantage, ethnic heterogeneity, residential instability, collective efficacy and legal cynicism. Data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) Longitudinal survey were used to identify 599 cases of IPV in Wave 1 eligible for reported desistance in Wave 2. A Generalized Boosting Model was used to determine the best proximal predictors of IPV desistance from the longitudinal data. Controlling for these predictors, logistic regression of neighborhood characteristics from the PHDCN community survey was used to predict reported IPV desistance in Wave 2. The paper finds that participants living in neighborhoods high in legal cynicism have lower odds of reporting IPV desistance, controlling for other variables in the logistic regression model. Analyses did not find that IPV desistance was related to neighborhood concentrated disadvantage, ethnic heterogeneity, residential instability and collective efficacy.

Intergenerational Continuities and Discontinuities in Intimate Partner Violence: A Two-Generational Prospective Study

Author: Smith, Carolyn A1; Ireland, Timothy O; Park, Aely; Elwyn, Laura; Thornberry, Terence P1 University at Albany, Albany, NY, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/915432608?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study focuses on intergenerational continuity in violent partner relationships. We investigate whether exposure to caregiver intimate partner violence (IPV) during adolescence leads to increased involvement in IPV during early adulthood (age 21-23) and adulthood (age 29-31). We also investigate whether this relationship differs by gender. Although there is theoretical and empirical support for intergenerational continuity of relationship violence, there are few prospective studies of this issue. We use data from the Rochester Youth Development Study (RYDS), a longitudinal study of the development of antisocial behavior in a community sample of 1,000 urban youth followed from age 14 to adulthood. The original sample includes 73% men and 85% African American or Hispanic youth. Measures come from a combination of interviews and official records. The Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) is used to assess IPV and severe IPV in the youth and parent generations. Analyses controlled for child physical abuse, race/ethnicity as well as parent education, family stability, and poverty. In multivariate models, adolescent exposure to caregiver severe IPV resulted in significantly increased risk of relationship violence in early adulthood (age 21-23). Furthermore, there is an indirect effect of adolescent exposure to severe IPV on later adult involvement in IPV (age 29-31), mediated by involvement in a violent relationship in early adulthood. These results were largely invariant by gender. However, we observed a direct pathway between IPV exposure and adult IPV for women (marginally significant) suggesting that adolescent exposure to caregiver IPV may set in motion women-specific processes.

The Role of Adolescent Physical Abuse in Adult Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Sunday, Suzanne1; Kline, Myriam; Labruna, Victor; Pelcovitz, David; Salzinger, Suzanne; Kaplan, Sandra1 Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/915432873?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study's primary aims were to examine whether a sample of young adults, aged 23 to 31, who had been documented as physically abused by their parent(s) during adolescence would be more likely to aggress, both physically and verbally, against their intimate partners compared with nonabused young adults and whether abuse history was (along with other risk factors) a significant predictor of intimate partner physical and emotional violence perpetration or victimization. In this longitudinal study, 67 abused and 78 nonabused adults (of an original sample of 198 adolescents) completed the Modified Conflict Tactics Scale and the Jealousy and Emotional Control Scales. Nonabused comparison adolescents were matched for age, gender, and community income. As adults, participants with abuse histories had significantly higher rates of intimate partner physical violence and verbal aggression than did comparison participants. Multivariate logistic regressions indicated that adults with histories of physical abuse were more than twice as likely to be physically violent and almost six times more likely to be verbally aggressive to their intimate partners than were comparison participants. Having had an alcohol use disorder, being married to or living with a partner, and perceiving one's partner as controlling were also significantly associated with physical violence. Jealousy and feeling controlled by one's partner were also significant predictors of verbal aggression. These findings underscore the importance of preventing adolescent abuse as a means of decreasing the incidence of intimate partner physical violence in adulthood.

Interventions targeting substance abuse among women survivors of intimate partner abuse: A meta-analysis

Author: Fowler, Dawnovise N1; Faulkner, Monica1 Centers for Disease Control, D3500, Atlanta, GA 30341, USA Tel.: +1 512 779 8644 dnfowler71@yahoo.com

Abstract: In this article, meta-analytic techniques are used to examine existing intervention studies (n = 11) to determine their effects on substance abuse among female samples of intimate partner abuse (IPA) survivors. This research serves as a starting point for greater attention in research and practice to the implementation of evidence-based, integrated services to address co-occurring substance abuse and IPA victimization among women as major intersecting public health problems. The results show greater effects in three main areas. First, greater effect sizes exist in studies where larger numbers of women experienced current IPA. Second, studies with a lower mean age also showed greater effect sizes than studies with a higher mean age. Lastly, studies with smaller sample sizes have greater effects. This research helps to facilitate cohesion in the knowledge base on this topic, and the findings of this meta-analysis, in particular, contribute needed information to gaps in the literature on the level of promise of existing interventions to impact substance abuse in this underserved population.

Constructions of masculinity in alcohol advertising: Implications for the prevention of domestic violence

Author: Towns, Alison J1; Parker, Christy; Chase, Philip1 Mt Albert Psychological Services Ltd, St. Lukes, Auckland, New Zealand atowns@pl.net

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1125225447?accountid=14925

Abstract: Alcohol advertisements are a potentially potent site for the representations of masculinity and gender relations given alcohol's role as a rite of passage for young men in Western cultures. Concerns about violence against women draw attention to the representations of masculinity that alcohol advertisements privilege and that may have important implications for gender relationships. Traditional masculinities have been associated with domestic violence particularly those that privilege men's dominance, entitlement and control of women. Egalitarian heterosexual relationships or intimacy, which involve compassion, equality and consensual decision-making, protect against domestic violence. In this article, we investigate the literature on alcohol advertising to determine the constructions of masculinity that are portrayed in advertisements particularly those targeting young men. We identify those constructions of masculinity and gender relations that are problematic for healthy, egalitarian, intimate heterosexual relationships and that are therefore problematic for the prevention of domestic violence.

Behind the screens: Domestic violence and health care practices

Author: Aschman, Gray; Meer, Talia; Artz, Lillian

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417523073?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence (DV) is one of the most pervasive forms of violence in South Africa with numerous physical and psychological consequences that have severe and enduring impacts on health. This takes a significant toll on women, their families and the health care system. Local and international literature suggests that DV is one of the most common reasons for women to present at health care facilities, placing health care practitioners in a unique position to identify abuse and intervene. As widespread as it is, DV is not a specifically prioritised public health concern and thus suffers from vastly inadequate resource allocation. The Domestic Violence Act, No 116 of 1998, was the first and only South African legislative attempt to recognise DV victims' rights to seek immediate medical assistance. It did not, however, impose any positive legal duties on health care practitioners to inquire about, screen for or holistically treat DV-related injuries and other health-related consequences of DV or make referrals. The Act only implies that health care practitioners have a duty to attend to DV cases. International codes delineate duties for health care practitioners in providing care for women in abusive relationships, and South Africa has detailed medico-legal protocols for the examination and treatment of survivors of sexual offences. It is therefore curious that a similar treatment protocol does not exist for DV. This Article reviews the literature on the health consequences of DV and the need for screening, and recounts the historical attempts of civil society in South Africa to impose legal duties on the state to assist DV victims who present to health care facilities. We argue that it is time that Parliament review the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act to include legal duties on health care practitioners to properly address the health consequences of DV.

Abstract: People will enter the process of a participant, following her journey through an experience in an art-therapy groupwork concerning domestic violence. Her attitude of "I want but I can't" will help people to reflect about the unconscious resistances that arise during the therapeutic processes and about the difficulties and the limits that bound them, the therapists, when they deal with these neurotic aspects.

Abstract: Intimate partner violence is a common but under-recognised issue for women attending primary care. There is a lack of studies looking at women's comfort to discuss and openness to getting help for health issues, including fear of a partner, in primary care. Female patients (aged 16-50 years) attending 55 general practitioners (GPs) in Victoria, Australia were mailed a brief survey that screened for health and lifestyle issues, comfort to discuss these issues and intention to get help in primary care. Needing physical activity and smoking were the issues women were most comfortable to discuss; followed by difficulty controlling what and/or how much is eaten, feeling down, depressed, hopeless or worried, and use of drugs or alcohol. Women were least comfortable to discuss fear of a partner and least likely to seek help for it from the GP or primary care nurse. However, as with the other issues, acceptability of being asked in a survey was high. All health and lifestyle issues predicted fear of a partner. Primary care practitioners should be aware of this complex major public health issue especially when carrying out preventive health care. Adapted from the source document.

Across the Divide: Using Research to Enhance Collaboration Between Mental Health and Domestic Violence Services

Author: Laing, Lesley; Irwin, Jude; Toivonen, Cherie

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1542000717?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recognition of the deleterious effects of domestic violence on women's mental health has highlighted the potential benefits for women of collaboration between mental health and domestic violence services. Yet the different histories, knowledge bases, and organisational cultures of the mental health and domestic violence sectors present formidable challenges to the development of effective collaborative work. This article draws on a large research enquiry, involving four separate but related studies, which explored aspects of collaboration between these two service sectors. It focuses particularly on data collected in interviews with practitioners from mental health and domestic violence services who were participants in an action research study (one of the four studies), which was aimed at discovering the factors that contributed to enhanced collaboration and the benefits of this for women who experience both domestic violence and mental health issues. Adapted from the source document.

Risk factors for unidirectional and bidirectional intimate partner violence among young adults

Author: Renner, Lynette M1; Whitney, Stephen D1 University of Iowa, School of Social Work, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1018352460?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to identify common and unique risk factors for intimate partner violence (IPV) among young adults in relationships. Guided by two models of IPV, the same set of risk factors was used to examine outcomes of unidirectional (perpetration or victimization) and bidirectional (reciprocal) IPV separately for males and females. The sample included 10,187 young adults, ages 18-27, from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The respondents were drawn from Wave 3 and stated they had a romantic relationship during the time of the study. The risk factors were primarily related to violent socialization (e.g., childhood maltreatment, youth violence) and personal adjustment (e.g., alcohol use, depression). Approximately 47% of the respondents experienced some form of IPV in romantic relationships, and the majority of respondents reported bidirectional violence. For males, childhood sexual abuse was associated with perpetration and bidirectional IPV, and childhood neglect was associated with bidirectional IPV. For females, childhood neglect was associated with all three IPV outcomes, and childhood physical abuse was associated with bidirectional IPV. Youth violence perpetration during adolescence increased the odds for all IPV outcomes among females, while low self-esteem increased the odds for all IPV outcomes among males. A history of suicide attempts predicted bidirectional IPV across genders. Being married and living with a partner predicted all three IPV outcomes for males and females. The results revealed more common risk factors for bidirectional IPV than unidirectional IPV and few common risk factors across genders. The results indicate that IPV prevention and intervention strategies should be tailored to the unique risk experiences of males and females rather than focus on a common factors approach. However, child abuse, youth violence, and suicide prevention efforts may reduce incidents of later IPV for males and females, and these strategies should continue to be an emphasis in practice and research.

Enhancing Safety-planning through Evidence-based Interventions with Preschoolers Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Miller, Laura E; Howell, Kathryn H; Hunter, Erin C; Graham-Bermann, Sandra A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023026589?accountid=14925

Abstract: Preschool children who witness severe intimate partner violence (IPV) are at increased risk for a wide range of emotional, behavioural, cognitive, and health problems. Although much of intervention research has focused on alleviating their psychological symptoms, we know little about efforts to provide these children with preventative safety training. The Preschool Kids' Club Program is a 10-session intervention that addresses the psychological adjustment of children and mothers exposed to IPV. It is based on the Kids' Club Program, which has already proved effective for school-aged children in decreasing behaviour problems and increasing safety-planning skills. The current study describes specific therapeutic strategies for teaching young children safety-planning, and uses qualitative methods to examine children's baseline knowledge of safety-planning and whether or not knowledge of safety-planning improves following participation in the Preschool Kids' Club Program. Results indicate preschool-aged children are able to learn adaptive safety-planning skills through intervention, but high rates of non-response indicate that much more needs to be done to reinforce safety-planning skills in young children. Clinical implications and recommendations for future research of the current findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Racial Differences in Satisfaction with Mental Health Services Among Victims of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Cho, Hyunkag1; Kim, Woo Jong1 School of Social Work, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, 48824, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1018364797?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on mental health among victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) has often ignored racial minorities. As the US population has become more racially diverse, the dearth of research on racial minorities' experience with current mental health systems makes it challenging for service providers and practitioners to serve them adequately. This study hypothesized that satisfaction with mental health services would be different across race in both the general population and among IPV victims. This study used the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys. Logistic regression analyses were conducted. The study results revealed racial differences in satisfaction only in the IPV group. Race had effects on perceived helpfulness among IPV victims. Asian victims of IPV were more likely to perceive mental health services as helpful than any other race groups. Financial security had a positive effect both on subjective satisfaction and perceived helpfulness among IPV victims. Adapted from the source document.

Gender and Relational-Distance Effects in Arrests for Domestic Violence

Author: Lally, William1; DeMaris, Alfred1 Bowling Green State University, OH

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1018355987?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study tests two hypotheses regarding factors affecting arrest of the perpetrator in domestic violence incidents. Black's relational-distance thesis is that the probability of arrest increases with increasing relational distance between perpetrator and victim. Klinger's leniency principle suggests that the probability of arrest is lower for male perpetrators assaulting female intimate partners, compared with other scenarios. The authors employed marginal logistic regression models using incident-based data from the National Survey of Violence and Threats of Violence Against Women and Men in the United States, 1994-1996, to test both effects. They found support for Black's thesis: The likelihood of arrest was lower when the perpetrator was an acquaintance, a relative, or a romantic partner of the victim, versus a stranger. However, the authors' results failed to support Klinger's hypothesis. They found that men were more likely to be arrested when assaulting a female-regardless of relationship status-compared with assaulting another male.

Perspectives on intimate partner violence in Swaziland amongst 18-29-year-old men undergoing medical circumcision

Author: Brear, Michelle1; Bessarab, Dawn1 Curtin University of Technology, Centre for International Health, Perth, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1266149515?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is perceived as a major contributor to HIV transmission in Swaziland. This exploratory study aimed to develop a culturally-specific understanding of men's perspectives of IPV. Focus group methods were used to gather information from 45 young urban Swazi men who had undergone medical male circumcision. A thematic analysis was conducted focussing on the manifestations of IPV and socio-cultural and economic factors which underpin, circumstances which trigger and social responses to IPV. The study identified numerous forms of economic, physical, emotional and sexual abuse that study participants perceived men used to control women in Swaziland. Many of these directly increased a woman's risk of HIV infection, including knowingly infecting a woman with HIV and intentionally impregnating a woman, a practice that has not previously been highlighted in the literature. Aspects of Swazi culture that may facilitate these particular forms of abuse are discussed. This study highlights the need for the gender issues which underpin IPV to be addressed in HIV prevention in Swaziland and for the development of an informed understanding of how and why IPV occurs in the Swazi context. Adapted from the source document.

Gender-Based Domestic Violence in Nigeria: A Socio-Legal Perspective

Author: Chika, Ifemeje Sylvia11 Senior Lecturer at Department of International Law & Jurisprudence, Faculty of Law, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Nigeria Sylvia.ifemeje@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037877518?accountid=14925

Abstract: Gender-based domestic violence, often targeted against women and girl children, is a global problem that has, in recent times, assumed an alarming proportion and dimension. The consequences of domestic violence are legion-it takes a devastating toll on women, families and nations, and furthermore, recent researches have shown increasing links between domestic violence and the high vulnerability of women to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This article, as the title indicates, focusses on domestic violence in Nigeria; it identifies and examines the various factors that have, over the years, militated against the eradication of this type of violence. The article proffers solutions on the best way forward in order to stem this growing tide of violence often targeted against women and girl children in Nigerian homes.

Abstract: Son preference has been considered as a determinant of women's risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) experience in India, although quantitative evidence from large nationally representative studies testing this relationship is limited. This study examines the association between husband's son preference, sex composition of children and risk of physical and sexual IPV victimization among wives. Information was collected for 26,284 couples in the nationally representative 2005-2006 National Family Health Survey of India. The exposures were husband's son preference measured as husband's desire for one or more sons greater than the number of daughters and sex composition of the household: only sons, only daughters and mixed. Outcome included past year physical and/or sexual IPV. The results showed that husband's reported son preference (RR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.98-1.13) and sex composition of children were not associated with risk for IPV victimization in the models adjusted for socio-demographic factors. The findings from this first population-based study of socio-cultural norms around son preference and married Indian women's risk for IPV victimization indicate that cultural preference for sons does not influence women's risk for IPV victimization.

CONTRACEPTION USE AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AMONG WOMEN IN BANGLADESH

Abstract: This study examines the association between contraception use and intimate partner violence (IPV) among women of reproductive age in Bangladesh. The observational study of 10,996 women used the chi-squared test and logistic regressions to assess the associations. Almost 80% of all respondents had used contraceptives at some point in their lives. About half of the respondents (48%) were victims of physical violence, while 11% experienced sexual abuse from their husbands. Urban residents, higher educated women and women aged 20-44 were more likely to use contraceptives than their peers in rural areas, those with lower education and those in their late forties (45-49 years). Women exposed to physical violence were almost two times (OR 1.93, CI 1.55-2.41) more likely to use contraceptives compared with their non-abused peers. Sexual abuse had no significant association with contraceptive use. Physical violence is a predictor for higher levels of contraceptive use among women in Bangladesh. The findings emphasize the importance of screening for IPV at health care centres. The differences in urban and rural contraceptive use and IPV exposure identified by the study have policy implications for service delivery and planning.

Pregnancy, Alcohol Intake, and Intimate Partner Violence among Men and Women Attending Drinking Establishments in a Cape Town, South Africa Township

Author: Eaton, Lisa A1; Kalichman, Seth C; Sikkema, Kathleen J; Skinner, Donald; Watt, Melissa H; Pieterse, Desiree; Pitpitan, Eileen V1 Center for Health, Intervention and Prevention, University of Connecticut lisaanne.eaton@gmail.com

Abstract: The highest rates of fetal alcohol syndrome worldwide can be found in South Africa. Particularly in impoverished townships in the Western Cape, pregnant women live in environments where alcohol intake during pregnancy has become normalized and interpersonal violence (IPV) is reported at high rates. For the current study we sought to examine how pregnancy, for both men and women, is related to alcohol use behaviors and IPV. We surveyed 2,120 men and women attending drinking establishments in a township located in the Western Cape of South Africa. Among women 13.3% reported being pregnant, and among men 12.0% reported their partner pregnant. For pregnant women, 61% reported attending the bar that evening to drink alcohol and 26% reported both alcohol use and currently experiencing IPV. Daily or almost daily binge drinking was reported twice as often among pregnant women than non-pregnant women (8.4% vs. 4.2%). Men with pregnant partners reported the highest rates of hitting sex partners, forcing a partner to have sex, and being forced to have sex. High rates of alcohol frequency, consumption, binge drinking, consumption and binge drinking were reported across the entire sample. In general, experiencing and perpetrating IPV were associated with alcohol use among all participants except for men with pregnant partners. Alcohol use among pregnant women attending shebeens is alarmingly high. Moreover, alcohol use appears to be an important factor in understanding the relationship between IPV and pregnancy. Intensive, targeted, and effective interventions for both men and women are urgently needed to address high rates of drinking alcohol among pregnant women who attend drinking establishments. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Domestic Violence Myths: A Comparison of Women With and Without Alcoholic Husbands (A Study from India)

Author: Stanley, Selwyn

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347784488?accountid=14925

Abstract: The alcoholism literature is replete with evidence documenting its adverse consequences for the family system in general and the interpersonal relationships of spouses in particular. An ex-post facto crossectional design was used to compare 150 women from India having alcoholic husbands with an equal number of women without alcoholic spouses. The two groups matched on key socio-demographic variables, were administered the Domestic Violence Myths Acceptance Scale (DVMAS, Peters, 2008) and the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS, Straus et al., 1996), to examine myths relating to domestic violence and the conflict tactics used by them. Higher levels of conflict were seen in the wives of alcoholics and on all its sub-dimensions namely negotiation, physical assault, injury, psychological aggression and sexual coercion. Differences were also significant on the subdimensions of the DVMAS namely character blame, behavior blame, perpetrator exoneration and minimization. Analysis of variance showed that wives of alcoholics from nonconsanguineous or arranged marriages or nuclear families did not differ significantly from their counterparts in the reference group on the subject dimensions studied. Results indicate the need to address issues relating to conflict and domestic violence related myths as part of therapeutic interventions with wives of alcoholics. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence in Mexico: Perspectives of Mexican Counselors

Author: Orozco, Arturo Enrique; Nievar, M Angela; Middlemiss, Wendy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347785095?accountid=14925

Abstract: Drawing on professional experiences of Mexican counselors, we examined the lives of women who experienced domestic violence from the perspective of those counselors working most closely with them. Although there are many studies that have investigated the origin and perpetuation of domestic violence in Mexico, few have included the participation of counselors. In the present study, we identify common antecedents of abuse from the perspective of counselors and note whether these antecedents match those identified in the literature from the victim's perspective. Economic resources, psychological treatment, social support, and an awareness of their situation are important factors identified by the counselors in moving women involved in domestic violence toward a positive resolution. According to counselors, economic and emotional dependence, a distorted view of family violence, partner's addiction to alcohol, social and family pressure, and specific cultural patterns may predict negative outcomes. Differences in antecedents identified by counselors were found in comparison to antecedents identified in literature from the victim's perspective. The present study revealed that alcohol may decrease inhibition in people who are already prone to use violence. In addition, the participants in this study pointed out other successful resolutions, which are not documented in previous studies. These resolutions are brought about through separation from the abusive partner and help from the legal system. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Research shows that the majority of couples presenting for couple therapy have experienced or are currently experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) within their relationships. It is also known that few couples present for therapy with IPV as their main concern and seldom do couples spontaneously report IPV. A review of the literature that provides a rationale for the utilization of a universal screening process for IPV is provided. After which, the authors look at the current IPV assessment and screening practices of marriage and family therapists in a marriage and family therapy training facility. A logistic regression procedure was used to determine if an IPV assessment could be predicted based on risk factors of IPV from self-report intake information completed by participants. Unfortunately, only if clients actually indicated that physical violence within their relationship was a current issue were they assessed. Adapted from the source document.

The Relationships Between Parent Communication Patterns and Sons' and Daughters' Intimate Partner Violence Involvement: Perspectives From Parents and Young Adult Children

Author: Babin, Elizabeth A1; Palazzolo, Kellie E1 School of Communication, Cleveland State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283641861?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the communication patterns of parents and how they related to intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration and victimization among young adult children. One hundred and ninety-three undergraduate students and 287 parents participated in this study. Hypothesis One predicted that parental conformity orientation would predict sons' and daughters' reports of IPV perpetration and victimization, whereas Hypothesis Two predicted that parental conversation orientation would predict sons and daughters reports of their own use of and an intimate partner's use of negotiation tactics. Both hypotheses received partial support. The results suggest that parent communication patterns have the potential to be both a risk and protective factor for young adult children's involvement in IPV. The findings also draw attention to important differences in the relationships that mothers and fathers have with their children, and differences between parent and child perspectives on parent communication.

Abstract: This study examined the relations between childhood maltreatment, daily life hassles, and intimate partner violence among low-income, suicidal, abused African American women (N=208). Findings indicated a significant association between childhood maltreatment and intimate partner violence, such that women who experienced childhood maltreatment were more likely to experience intimate partner violence as adults than those who reported no childhood maltreatment history. Also, results from bootstrapping analyses revealed that daily life stressors mediated the link between childhood maltreatment and both physical and nonphysical forms of intimate partner violence. These findings highlight the importance of thoroughly assessing for a history of childhood maltreatment, current intimate partner violence, and the nature and extent of daily hassles when working with low-income African American women, as well as helping abused women with a history of childhood maltreatment to cope effectively with the daily life hassles that they encounter.

Risk of Revictimization of Intimate Partner Violence: The Role of Attachment, Anger and Violent Behavior of the Victim

Author: Kuijpers, Karlijn F1; Knaap, Leontien M; Winkel, Frans Willem1 Leiden Law School, Institute for Criminal Law and Criminology, Leiden University, Room C 1.19, P.O. Box 9520, 2300, RA, Leiden, The Netherlands k.f.kuijpers@law.leidenuniv.nl

Abstract: Victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) are known to be at high risk for revictimization. Yet, to date, the mechanisms explaining the link between victimization and revictimization of IPV have not been extensively studied. In the present prospective study involving 74 female help-seeking victims of IPV, we investigated victim-related psychological mechanisms that may underlie this link. With this study, we aim to contribute to the development of theory addressing these psychological mechanisms and their role in explaining risk for IPV revictimization. Hypotheses regarding possibly relevant psychological mechanisms were derived from two conflicting approaches to IPV: the gender perspective, and the mutual IPV perspective. Results lend further support to the mutual IPV perspective, since our final prediction model indicates that victim-perpetrated IPV is an important risk factor for physical and psychological IPV revictimization. An avoidant attachment style shows to be a strong predictor as well, in particular for victims with high and average anger levels. Findings provide clear indications for risk assessment and treatment of IPV victims, and moreover offer opportunities to empower these victims in order to prevent future violence.

Does Separation or Divorce Make Any Difference? An Interactional Perspective on Intimate Partner Violence with Focus on Marital Status

Author: Vatnar, Solveig Karin Bo1; Bjorkly, Stal1 Centre for Research and Education in Forensic Psychiatry, Oslo University Hospital, Ulleval, Gaustad, Building 7, N-0407, Oslo, Norway solveig.vatnar@kompetanse-senteret.no

Abstract: This article reports a study of the impact of marital status on interactional aspects of intimate partner violence (IPV) among help-seeking women. Are there differences among marital status groups concerning (a) other sociodemographic variables, (b) IPV categories, (c) interactional IPV variables, and (d) perception and interpretation of IPV? A representative sample of 157 women recruited from family counseling, the police, and shelters were interviewed. There was no significant sociodemographic difference among the marital status groups. There were no significant differences pertaining to IPV categories, neither for IPV severity, injury, duration, frequency, mortal danger, and regularity, nor for physical, psychological, or sexual IPV. However, multivariate logistic regression showed that post-separation women were significantly more likely to have (a) had longer duration since the last psychological and sexual IPV episode, (2) reported the physical IPV to be more predictable, and (3) used more active coping strategies against physical IPV. However, our research was not able to determine if perception and interpretation predict actual leaving behavior, or vice versa, or how the victim's subjective perception and interpretation of the IPV changes over time. Adapted from the source document.

Mothers' Motivations for Intimate Partner Violence Help-Seeking

Author: Randell, Kimberly A1; Bledsoe, Linda K; Shroff, Purvi L; Pierce, Mary Clyde1 Division of Emergency Medical Services, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Mercy Hospital, 2401 Gillham Road, Kansas City, MO, 64108, USA karandell@cmh.edu

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine motivators for intimate partner violence (IPV) help-seeking among mothers. This qualitative study used English and Spanish-speaking focus groups and a grounded theory approach. Sixty-two mothers participated in eight groups. Motivators for IPV help-seeking fell into two broad categories, internal and external motivators. Although participants cited numerous motivators for IPV help-seeking, recognizing the negative effects of IPV on their children, labeling the partner's behavior as abusive and the intervention of others were particularly important. For many participants, the effects of IPV on their children were the most important motivator. Few women made the decision to seek help without the encouragement of others. Unique to the Spanish-speaking participants was the influence of immigration status and limitations to disclosure created by using significant others as translators. Exploration of incorporating these motivators into IPV intervention efforts is warranted. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Psychological Distress among Young Couples: Analysis of the Moderating Effect of Social Support

Author: Fortin, Isabel1; Guay, Stephane; Lavoie, Vicky; Boisvert, Jean-Marie; Beaudry, Madeleine1 School of Criminology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada

Abstract: Young adults are more likely to experience intimate partner violence (IPV) than older adults. Little is known about the effect of confiding to others about sustained violence on the mental health of victims. The objective of this study was to explore the links between IPV, help-seeking behaviors and psychological distress by gender in a sample of 233 young couples. Our results indicate the frequency of sustained psychological violence, but not physical violence, was positively associated to distress. For women, seeking help from a greater number of confidents moderated the association between violence and psychological distress. For men, results showed that frequencies of physical and psychological violence were both positively linked to distress. However, unlike women, social support had no buffering effect on men's distress. These findings increase our understanding of the effects of social support on young adults' distress following episodes of IPV. Adapted from the source document.

Sexual Orientation, Social Support Networks, and Dating Violence in an Ethnically Diverse Group of College Students

Author: Jones, Cassandra A1; Raghavan, Chitra1 University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1266147873?accountid=14925

Abstract: Male peer support theory is based on same-gender influences on men perpetrating dating violence against women. However, research indicates that male peer support theory might not hold for cross-gender influences and lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) relationships. This study examined across sexual orientation the composition of social support networks and their influence on dating violence in an ethnically diverse group of college students. The results indicated composition of networks and frequency of dating violence was similar across sexual orientation, but the influence of networks differed across sexual orientation. Policies and services targeting LGB students experiencing dating violence should consider the influence of networks. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence against Men in India: A Perspective

Author: Kumar, Anant11 Department of Rural Management, Xavier Institute of Social Service, Ranchi, India anantkumar@xiss.ac.in

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347781466?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the absence of any systemic data, with more men coming up and reporting violence by women, it is important to understand and examine the issue of violence against men by women and associated factors. With changing gender roles and power relations, the author predicts that this will increase in the future, which will have far-reaching consequences and implications for the larger society and relationships between men and women. The paper attempts to understand the dynamics and factors that play or will play a crucial role in escalating violence against men by women. The paper is based on author's counseling sessions, discussion with men victims of violence, and other secondary sources. Adapted from the source document.

Predictors of Being Unsafe: Participation in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2006 Intimate Partner Violence Module

Author: Ranney, Megan L1; Madsen, Tracy; Gjelsvik, Annie1 Rhode Island Hospital, Alpert School of Medicine of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/915415263?accountid=14925

Abstract: A common reason for not participating in intimate partner violence (IPV) research is thought to be fear for one's safety. However, little is known about those who do not participate due to safety fears. To better characterize this population, we investigated correlates of being "not safe" to answer the optional IPV module in the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), a yearly cross-sectional telephone survey in the United States. We compared those who said they were not safe to complete the module with those who were safe and reported (+IPV) or denied (-IPV) IPV. Forward stepwise multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify significant correlates of being not-safe. Those who said they were not safe to answer IPV questions were found to have lower income, lower education levels, and were older than either +IPV or -IPV respondents. They were also more likely to be male than the +IPV group. The not-safe differ from those traditionally identified as being at greatest risk for IPV. However, the percentage of IPV victims in the not-safe group remains unknown. Greater efforts should be made to include this group in future IPV research, both to determine these groups' true IPV risk and to avoid missing potential IPV victims. The validity, reliability, and comprehensibility of safety questions should also be assessed.

Exposure to Intimate Partner Violence, Peer Relations, and Risk for Internalizing Behaviors: A Prospective Longitudinal Study

Author: Camacho, Kathleen1; Ehrensaft, Miriam K; Cohen, Patricia1 John Jay College of Criminal Justice, New York

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/915426562?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study examines the quality of peer relations as a mediator between exposure to IPV (intimate partner violence) and internalizing behaviors in a sample of 129 preadolescents and adolescents (ages 10-18), who were interviewed via telephone as part of a multigenerational, prospective, longitudinal study. Relational victimization is also examined as a moderator of IPV exposure on internalizing behaviors. Results demonstrate a significant association of exposure to severe IPV and internalizing behaviors. Relational victimization is found to moderate the effects of exposure to severe IPV on internalizing behaviors. The present findings suggest that the effects of exposure to IPV had a particularly important effect on the risk for internalizing problems if the adolescent also experienced relational victimization. Conversely, the receipt of prosocial behaviors buffer against the effects of IPV exposure on internalizing symptoms in teen girls.

Gender Symmetry in the Self-Reporting of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Chan, Ko Ling11 University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/926743112?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research has not conclusively determined whether men and women are equally likely to commit intimate partner violence (IPV). One explanation for the disparity in previous findings may be gender-based differences in reporting styles. The present study investigated whether there was any gender difference in self-reported IPV prevalence. A total of 3,740 Chinese couples from a representative population in Hong Kong were interviewed. Self-reports of men-to-women and women-to-men IPV between spouses were compared. Gender was controlled for to evaluate whether age, education, the Chinese concept of face, and other violence-related characteristics would affect the self-reporting of IPV. Findings supported gender symmetry in self-reported IPV prevalence as well as a moderate interspousal agreement in the self-reports. After adjustment for covariates, face was a significant factor predicting the interspousal differences in both men-to-women and women-to-men physical IPV.

Racial Differences in the Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women and Associated Factors

Author: Cho, Hyunkag11 Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1018354714?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence against women (IPV) affects all populations, but significant variations among these groups have been suggested. However, research results on racial differences in IPV are not only inconclusive, they are also limited-particularly with regard to racial minorities. As a result, it has been challenging for practitioners and service providers in many communities to serve an increasing number of racial minority clients. This study used the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) to examine differences in the prevalence of IPV, and associated factors, among major race groups in the U.S. Included variables were age, race, financial security, employment, education, social network, IPV perpetration and victimization, and severity of IPV. The results showed that Blacks were victimized the most, followed by Whites and Latinos, and Asians were victimized the least. Asians were the least likely to be victimized by IPV, even when controlling for sociodemographic variables. The odds of victimization for Blacks and Latinos were not significantly different from Whites. Financial security and age affected IPV victimization. Those who perceived themselves as financially secure were less likely to be victimized than those who did not. The older were less likely to be victimized than the younger. Employment, education, and social networks did not affect victimization. Race was not a significant predictor of perpetration, when controlling for other variables. Age was the only predictor of perpetration: the older were less likely to perpetrate IPV than the younger. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Examining the Perceptions of Zimbabwean Women about the Domestic Violence Act

Author: Makahamadze, Tompson1; Isacco, Anthony; Chireshe, Excellent1 Chatham University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023028835?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to qualitatively examine how Christian women from Zimbabwe perceived the effectiveness of the Domestic Violence Act in preventing and responding to domestic violence. The study also aims to understand the unique social, cultural, and religious context of the participants that affect their attitudes and beliefs about this legislation. The findings of the study are based on an analysis of qualitative interviews. The women were recruited from the Roman Catholic Church (RCC); Reformed Church in Zimbabwe (RCZ); Methodist Church in Zimbabwe (MCZ); Zimbabwe Assembly of God Africa (ZAOGA), and Apostolic Faith Mission (AFM) in the Masvingo urban area. Most of the participants expressed confidence in the Act, saying that it goes a long way in curbing domestic violence. The participants who indicated lack of confidence in the Act argued that it is contrary to the teachings of their Christian denominations. The study also revealed that lack of confidence in the Act is due to lack of knowledge about the legislation. In particular, many were unaware of the fact that physical, psychological, and emotional abuse constitutes justification for a protection order that can remain in force when a protected person is living with the perpetrator. The article discusses these findings in relation to domestic violence in other cultures and countries and recommends raising awareness of the importance of this useful piece of legislation.

Systemic Perspectives on Intimate Partner Violence Treatment

Author: Stith, Sandra M1; McCollum, Eric E; Amanor-Boadu, Yvonne; Smith, Douglas1 Kansas State University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010634988?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reviews changes in the research literature on intimate partner violence (IPV) since our earlier review. A rationale for systemic treatment of IPV has emerged from research that has continued to document the limited effectiveness of single-gender treatment approaches for offenders and that has identified subtypes of abusive relationships, including situational couple violence, which often includes the reciprocal use of violence. Consistent findings from the available outcome research have demonstrated that for carefully screened couples who choose to stay together, systemic interventions decrease incidences of IPV and decrease the risk factors for IPV with no increase in risk. Implications for research and treatment are offered. Adapted from the source document.

Personality Profiles of Intimate Partner Violence Offenders With and Without PTSD

Author: Hoyt, Tim1; Wray, Alisha M; Wiggins, Kathryn T; Gerstle, Melissa; Maclean, Peggy C1 Department of Psychology, University of New Mexico, New Mexico, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1221410840?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious forensic and clinical problem throughout the United States. Research aimed at defining and differentiating subgroups of IPV offenders using standardized personality instruments may eventually help with matching treatments to specific individuals to reduce recidivism. The current study used a convenience sample of court-ordered IPV offenders to explore whether the presence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can reliably differentiate this population in terms of personality characteristics and clinical symptoms. Profile analysis showed meaningful differences between PTSD (n = 22), non-PTSD (n = 43), and nontrauma (n = 13) groups on a variety of Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory and Personality Assessment Inventory personality and clinical scales. The PTSD group reported significantly less IPV than the non-PTSD and nontrauma groups, as well as endorsing greater overall distress, greater symptoms of anxiety, and greater symptoms of depression across instruments. Implications for assessment are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Overcoming Barriers in Intimate Partner Violence Education and Training of Graduate Social Work Students

Author: Connor, Pamela D1; Nouer, Simonne S; Mackey, SeeTrail N; Banet, Megan S; Tipton, Nathan G1 Department of Preventative Medicine, Health Science Center, University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee, USA

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a highly prevalent problem detected frequently in the social work field, and also extends to the personal lives of social workers and students, with compelling evidence that professionals and students are often victims of IPV. However, students continue to lack substantive knowledge of IPV. This article addresses the need for increased IPV education and training for social work students and professionals by measuring IPV education, knowledge, and attitudes among students, while also examining the incidence of student personal experience with IPV and exploring the role this experience plays in identifying and safely intervening in IPV situations. Adapted from the source document.

The Association Between Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration, Victimization, and Mental Health Among Women Arrested for Domestic Violence

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major problem. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of research on the associations between IPV perpetration, victimization, and mental health among women. This study examined these associations among a sample of women arrested for domestic violence and court-referred to batterer intervention programs (BIPs; N = 88). Using self-report screening instruments for Axis I and Axis II mental health problems, results showed very high rates of mental health problems among women. In addition, both IPV perpetration and victimization were associated with increased mental health symptoms. Women who met diagnostic cutoff scores reported greater IPV perpetration/victimization than women who did not meet those cutoff scores. Implications of these findings for future research and IPV interventions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious, devastating, and prevalent problem. IPV places women at risk for negative health consequences, including increased mental health disorders. The majority of research to date has focused on mental health disorders among women in domestic violence shelters, and research is needed that examines mental health disorders among a broader range of women experiencing IPV. Therefore, this study examined the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance abuse disorders in a community sample of IPV victims (N = 94) using diagnostic interviews. Results showed that the majority of women met diagnostic criteria for a mental health disorder, with PTSD being the most common mental health disorder. Furthermore, psychological abuse was a significant predictor of both PTSD and depression, whereas physical aggression did not predict these outcomes. Implications of these findings for treatment and intervention work with battered women are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

An Eye for an Eye: Gender Revanchisme and the Negation of Attachment in Domestic Violence Policy

Abstract: Domestic violence policy and practice occupy a unique, complex, and often paradoxical cultural and legal space. The criminalization of domestic violence stands in stark contrast to greater social tolerance for violence among other family role sets, particularly those involving children. Debates concerning the role of gender in domestic violence emphasizing either male perpetration toward females or broadening the analysis to include mutuality of violence, female perpetration, and same-sex partner violence miss both key latent sociopolitical functions of policy and the greater complexity of gender across other forms of family violence. Harsher criminal penalties for offenders and current Duluth model inspired treatment approaches have not produced any evidence of commensurate declines in domestic violence. We have substituted vengeance for efficacy in our zeal to displace societal responsibility for domestic violence to scapegoated "batterers.". Adapted from the source document.

Rates of Bidirectional Versus Unidirectional Intimate Partner Violence Across Samples, Sexual Orientations, and Race/Ethnicities: A Comprehensive Review

Author: Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Jennifer1; Misra, Tiffany A; Selwyn, Candice; Rohling, Martin L1 Life Sciences Building, Room 320, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL 36688-0002

Abstract: One hotly debated topic within the field of intimate partner violence (IPV) is the degree to which IPV can be understood as primarily a unidirectional versus bidirectional phenomena; this topic forms a key component of the gender symmetry versus asymmetry of domestic violence debate. Resolution of this controversy has important prevention and intervention implications. In the current study, a comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, and 48 studies that reported rates of bidirectional versus unidirectional physical violence (male-to-female and female-to-male) were uncovered using a variety of search engines and key terms; one rele vant meta-analysis and one seminal book chapter were also identified. Included empirical studies were published in 1990 or later, appeared in peer-reviewed journals, and contained empirical data directly related to bidirectionality of violence. Studies that only reported correlations between self-reported perpetration and victimization were excluded from these analyses. Qualifying studies were then categorized by the nature of the sample they assessed (i.e., large population samples; smaller community; purposive or convenience samples; clinical or treatment-seeking samples; legal/criminal justice-related samples; and samples assessing the relationships of gay, lesbian, and/or bisexual individuals). Rates of bidirectional versus unidirectional violence (male-toward-female vs. female-toward-male) were summarized directly as reported or were derived on the basis of data contained within the article. All obtained studies (48 empirical, 1 meta-analysis, 1 book chapter) were then entered into an online summary table for public review; however, additional results were specifically calculated for the current article. These results indicate that bidirectional violence was common across all types of samples (population-based to criminal justice). This suggests that the role of women in violent relationships is important to consider, even if all aspects of women's perpetration of IPV are not symmetrical to men's perpetration of IPV. A second finding to emerge was that the ratio of unidirectional female to-male compared to male-to-female IPV differed significantly among samples with higher rates of female-perpetrated unidirectional violence found in four of the five sample types considered. Higher ratios of male-to-female unidirectional violence were found only in criminal justice/legal studies that relied on police reports of IPV perpetration and/or in samples drawn from the U.S. military. Competing explanations for the differing ratios were offered in the current discussion. These need to be tested empirically in order to fully understand the expression of IPV across samples and settings. Differences in the directionality of the expression of IPV were not found in samples of gay, lesbian, or bisexual individuals; however, rates of bidirectional violence appear to vary by race/ethnicity with higher rates of bidirectional violence among Black couples. Overall, it is suggested that if one resolution of the gender symmetry/asymmetry debate is to argue that there are subtypes of male and female domestic violence perpetrators (Johnson, 2005; Johnson, 2006), or that there are different patterns of violence among different types of relationships characterized by IPV (Stets & Straus, 1989), researchers and clinicians will need to work together to determine how to reliably and meaningfully make these determinations in ways that will facilitate our ability to effectively prevent and treat all types of IPV.

Abstract: A systematic review of risk factors for intimate partner violence IPV was conducted. Inclusion criteria included publication in a peer-reviewed journal, a representative community sample or a clinical sample with a control group comparison, a response rate of at least 50%, use of a physical or sexual violence outcome measure, and control of confounding factors in the analyses. A total of 228 articles were included (170 articles with adult and 58 with adolescent samples). Organized by levels of a dynamic developmental systems perspective, risk factors included (a) contextual characteristics of partners (demographic, neighborhood, community, and school factors), (b) developmental characteristics and behaviors of the partners (e.g., family, peer, psychological/behavioral, and cognitive factors), and (c) relationship influences and interactional patterns. Comparisons to a prior review highlight developments in the field in the past 10 years. Recommendations for intervention and policy along with future directions for IPV risk factor research are presented. Adapted from the source document.

Prevalence of Partner Abuse: Rates of Emotional Abuse and Control

Author: Carney, Michelle Mohr1; Barner, John R1 College of Family and Consumer Sciences, Department of Human Development and Family Science, University of Georgia, 114 Dawson Hall, Athens, GA 30602

Abstract: Partner abuse research over the past two decades has divided violent, threatening, or abusive phenomena into discrete areas of interest to researchers that, although distinct, are still broadly defined under the common category of "domestic abuse" or, more recently, intimate partner violence (IPV). Thus, any concerted attempt to typify the various substrata of IPV research must recognize the distinct features of each area regarding their component parts (i.e., behavioral or psychological sequelae, incidence and prevalence, and social or interpersonal context) while maintaining the overarching categorical commonality as variants of IPV. This article constitutes a contemporaneous and systematic review of the research on three aspects of controlling coercive violence (CCV): emotional abuse, sexual coercion, and stalking or obsessive behavior, along with a separate examination of when these IPV substrata are combined with physical assaults on intimate partners. Each CCV substrata is operationally defined in research terms common to the social science research, and tabular and narrative data is provided on the incidence and prevalence of each substrata and the combined category. Notable findings derived from this review are reported for each of the three aspects of CCV. For emotional abuse, prevalence rates might average around 80%, with 40% of women and 32% of men reporting expressive aggression (i.e., verbal abuse or emotional violence in response to some agitating or aggravating circumstance) and 41% of women and 43% of men reporting some form of coercive control. For sexual coercion, national samples demonstrated the widest disparity by gender of victim, with 0.2% of men and 4.5% of women endorsing forced sexual intercourse by a partner. By far, the largest selection of highly variable studies, stalking and obsessive behaviors showed a range from 4.1% to 8.0% of women and 0.5% to 2.0% of men in the United States have been stalked at some time in their life. Women were reported as having a significantly higher prevalence (7%) of stalking victimization than men (2%). For all types of violence, except being followed in a way that frightened them, strangers were the most common perpetrators; as reported in approximately 80% of cases, women were most often victimized by men they knew, most frequently, their current or former intimate partners. Among women who reported repeated unwanted contact, current (15.9%) and former (32.9%) intimate partners were the perpetrators in nearly half of the most recent incidents and the largest subdivision of reports came from college or university student samples. A separate examination reports of these types of IPV combined with physical assaults on intimate partners reported the strongest link was between stalking and other forms of violence in intimate relationships: 81% of women who were stalked by a current or former husband or cohabiting partner were also physically assaulted by that partner and 31% reported being sexually assaulted by that partner. Of the types of IPV reported on, most forms of violence that show the highest rates of reportage come from large national samples, with smaller samples showing increased variability. This article concludes with a brief section delineating conclusions that can be drawn from the review and the potential implications for research, practice, and IPV scholarship.

Partner Abuse in Ethnic Minority and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Populations

Author: West, Carolyn M11 University of Washington, 1900 Commerce Street, Tacoma, WA 98402 carwest@uw.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1081870843?accountid=14925

Abstract: This review seeks to synthesize the current state of knowledge regarding gender differences in rates of physical and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) prevalence among the four largest racial/ethnic groups in the United States, compares rates of physical and psychological IPV between sexual minorities and heterosexuals and among subgroups of sexual minorities (gay men, lesbians, bisexuals), and summarizes correlates and risk factors that are associated with rates of IPV in both ethnic and sexual minorities. A systematic search of the published literature in the past 40 years using various search engines (e.g., PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) was conducted. The review identified 55 studies that met criteria. Few gender differences in rates of physical and psychological aggression were found among African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, and Native American men and women. Psychological aggression was most frequently reported. Bidirectional violence, which primarily took the form of minor aggression, was the most frequently reported form of physical violence. When unidirectional aggression was assessed, it was more likely to be female perpetrated, particularly among African Americans. These gender patterns were consistent across general population, student, and community studies. Respondents who reported a history of same-sex cohabitation and those who identified as sexual minorities reported higher rates of IPV than those who reported only a history of opposite-sex cohabitation and those who identified as heterosexual. Regarding sexual minority subgroup differences, bisexuals appeared to be at a greater risk of IPV, and victimization among transgendered individuals has largely been neglected in the literature. Substance abuse and use, marginalized socioeconomic status in the form of family and neighborhood poverty, and exposure to violence during childhood as a witness or victim of violence in the family of origin were consistently linked to elevated rates of IPV. Associations also were found between level of acculturation and minority stress in the form of internalized homophobia and frequency of discrimination based on sexual orientation. However, the complex association among these variables was less clear across racial groups and sexual orientation. Research limitations and future research directions are discussed.

The Combined and Independent Impact of Witnessed Intimate Partner Violence and Child Maltreatment

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive issue, generating startling facts regarding its detrimental societal effects. There is also considerable overlap between witnessing IPV and experiencing childhood maltreatment. The current article reviews the state of the knowledge about the short- and long-term impact of witnessing IPV as well as a review of the literature exploring the unique impact of experiencing both IPV and maltreatment compared to witnessing only. Seventy-three articles were included in the present review. Negative outcomes in youth have been reported in both the internalizing and externalizing domains of functioning, in health and cognitive domains, as well as in youth's relationships with family, peers, and romantic partners. The current literature suggests that these negative impacts persist into adulthood. Mixed results, whether there are significant additive effects of witnessing IPV and child maltreatment compared to witnessing IPV only, were found in youth and again into adulthood. Policy implications and recommendations for future research are suggested. Adapted from the source document.

The Impact and Consequences of Partner Abuse on Partners

Author: Lawrence, Erika1; Orengo-Aguayo, Rosaura; Langer, Amie; Brock, Rebecca L1 Department of Psychology, University of Iowa, E11 Seashore Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242-1409 erika-lawrence@uiowa.edu

Abstract: This study represents a comprehensive review and critique of 122 empirical articles and 10 review articles on the psychological and physical consequences of psychological and physical abuse on partners and yielded several strong and consistent conclusions. Victims of psychological and physical abuse experience more physical injuries, poorer physical functioning and health outcomes, higher rates of psychological symptoms and disorders, and poorer cognitive functioning compared to nonvictims. These findings were consistent regardless of the nature of the sample and, with some exceptions, generally greater for female victims compared to male victims. Moreover, psychological victimization appears to be at least as strongly related to victims' psychological consequences as is physical victimization. There was a relative dearth of research examining the consequences of psychological abuse for male victims, and the results of those studies have been mixed. Research examining sex differences yields strong and consistent evidence that physical violence has more deleterious consequences for women overall. However, the severity of the physical abuse seems to moderate differences in injury rates. In addition to these known findings from past reviews, this study generated several novel findings. First, there is a small but critical group of studies demonstrating the effects of abuse on health behaviors. Second, physical victimization has serious economic and social consequences for victims and society at large. Third, the consequences of abuse were significantly worse for female victims who were of low income, ethnic minorities, and/or unemployed. In the second section of this article, we critique the existing literature in terms of the content of the research, as well as on conceptual and methodological grounds. In the third section we offer specific recommendations for future research and intervention efforts. Adapted from the source document.

Motivations for Men and Women's Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration: A Comprehensive Review

Author: Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Jennifer1; McCullars, Adrianne; Misra, Tiffany A1 Life Sciences Building Room 320, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL 36688-0002

Abstract: The main purpose of this review article was to collect and summarize all available papers that reported empirical data related to men's and women's motivations for IPV. To facilitate direct gender comparisons, the motives reported in each obtained study were coded by the current authors into seven broad categories: (a) power/control, (b) self-defense, (c) expression of negative emotion (i.e., anger), (d) communication difficulties, (e) retaliation, (f) jealousy, and (g) other. Across the 75 samples (located in 74 articles) that were reviewed and coded for this study, 24 contained samples of only women (32%), 6 samples consisted of only men (8%), and 46 samples used both women and men (62%). Power/control and self-defense were commonly measured motivations (76% and 61%, respectively). However, using violence as an expression of negative emotion (63%), communication difficulties (48%), retaliation (60%), or because of jealousy (49%) were also commonly assessed motives. In 62% of the samples, at least one other type of motive was also measured. Only 18 of the located study samples (24%) included data that allowed for a direct gender comparison of men's and women's reported motivations. Many of these studies did not subject their data to statistical analyses. Among those that did, very few gender-specific motives for perpetration emerged. These results should be viewed with caution, however, because many methodological and measurement challenges exist in this field. There was also considerable heterogeneity across papers making direct gender comparisons problematic. Adapted from the source document.

The Crime Control Effects of Criminal Sanctions for Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Maxwell, Christopher D1; Garner, Joel H1 School of Criminal Justice, Michigan State University, 655 Auditorium Road, Room 560 Baker Hall, East Lansing, MI 48824 cmaxwell@msu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283644010?accountid=14925

Abstract: A prior review of published research established that once an intimate violence offense results in an arrest, the use of criminal prosecution and conviction is more commonplace than traditionally thought. The substantial use of criminal sanctions beyond arrest heightens the salience of whether criminal sanctions for intimate partner violence have a crime control effect or not. This research seeks to contribute to this discussion by providing a systematic review of 31 published studies that provide evidence regarding the crime control benefits from prosecution, conviction, and sentencing of intimate partner violence offenders. This review describes the characteristics of each of these studies, summarizes the substantive findings reported, and evaluates the research designs, measures, and methods used. Across these studies, we array 143 reported tests into three crime prevention hypotheses: the prosecution hypothesis, the conviction hypothesis, and the sanction severity hypothesis. Based on the analyses and conclusions produced by these studies, we find that the most frequent outcome is that sanctions that follow an arrest for intimate partner violence have no effect on the prevalence of subsequent offending. However, among the minority of reported analyses that do report a statistically significant effect, two thirds of the published findings show sanctions to be associated with reductions in repeat offending and one third show sanctions to be associated with increased repeat offending. Our examination of the methods used by these studies identified seven common issues that suggest that the research designs used are inadequate to assess the relevant public policies and criminological theories. Based on our systematic assessment of the published studies, we conclude that the preponderance of the reported findings show no effect for criminal sanctions; moreover, the quality of the research methods used in this research provide an insufficient basis to support a conclusion about the use of criminal prosecution and sentencing for intimate partner violence.

Gender and Racial/Ethnic Differences in Criminal Justice Decision Making in Intimate Partner Violence Cases

Author: Shernock, Stan1; Russell, Brenda1 School of Justice Studies and Sociology, Norwich University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283641366?accountid=14925

Abstract: This literature review examines the existing empirical literature on gender and racial/ethnic differences in issuance of protective orders, arrest, prosecution, and simulated jury verdicts in intimate partner violence cases. An evaluation of the methodologies employed found that some studies have used surveys of reactions to simulated scenarios, others official data sources, such as police reports and court records, and others interviews or surveys of victims or suspects; but few have used triangulation of different types of sources. Most studies on differential treatment in arrest and prosecution have focused on gender and then race, whereas studies on differential decision making in the issuance of protective orders and jury decision making have focused primarily on gender. In terms of the differential criminal justice response regarding demographic categories, it appears that there is the less favorable treatment of males but more impartial treatment toward racial/ethnic minorities regarding the issuance of protection orders, arrest, and prosecution. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic violence and child nutrition in Liberia

Author: Sobkoviak, Rudina M1; Yount, Kathryn M; Halim, Nafisa1 SAND International, United States

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1018343054?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence against women is endemic globally and is an important social problem in its own right. A compounding concern is the impact of domestic violence against mothers on the nutritional status of their children. Liberia is an apt setting to examine this understudied topic, given the poor nutritional status of young children, high rate of domestic violence against women, and prolonged period of conflict that included systematic sexual violence against women. We expected that maternal exposure to domestic violence would predict lower anthropometric z-scores and higher odds of stunting, wasting, and underweight in children less than five years. Using data from 2467 mother-child dyads in the 2007 Liberia Demographic and Health Survey (LDHS) undertaken between December 24, 2006 and April 19, 2007, we conducted descriptive and multivariate analyses to examine the total, unadjusted and adjusted associations of maternal exposure to domestic violence with these anthropometric measures in children. Maternal reports of sexual domestic violence in the prior year predicted lower adjusted z-scores for height-for-age and weight-for-height as well as higher odds of stunting and underweight. The findings underscore the needs to (1) enhance and enforce conventional and customary laws to prevent the occurrence of domestic violence; (2) treat maternal survivors of domestic violence and screen their children for nutritional deficits; (3) heighten awareness of the intergenerational implications especially of recent sexual domestic violence; and (4) clarify the biological and behavior pathways by which domestic violence may influence child growth, thereby mitigating early growth failure and its adverse implications into adulthood.

The surreptitious feminization of domestic violence

Author: Hall, Ronald E11 Michigan State University, 224 Baker Hall, East Lansing, Mi. 48824, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1650142044?accountid=14925

Abstract: While most victims of domestic violence are women those prone to acts of domestic violence cannot be universally identified as male. Domestic violence permeates Western societies such as the United States and the United Kingdom which includes male victims who are frequently denied or overlooked. This may be due to differences in reporting of domestic violence between men and women and may mean that the rates of victimization for males and females is much less sex-based than it appears. As a result, to the extent that Social Work and who has access to services is a culturally constructed phenomenon, male victims in need require advocates in all areas whose sole purpose is problem resolution.

Understanding and Addressing Stigma and Attachment Insecurity in HIV-Positive Women Who Experience Intimate Partner Violence: A Model of Medical and Psychosocial Care

Author: Davis, Katy B11 Smith College School for Social Work, Massachusetts, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1221410849?accountid=14925

Abstract: Low-income women of color who are HIV positive and living in violent relationships are at significant risk for stigma and problems with attachment security. This article explores the ways in which these women may experience internalized stigma from incorporating society's negative views of HIV and domestic violence. It also addresses the ways in which insecure attachment may develop or intensify in this population through violence in their adult intimate relationships and/or living with a life threatening illness. A model of medical and psychosocial care utilized at the Women's HIV Program at the University of California San Francisco is offered as an intervention to reduce stigma and enhance healthy attachment.

Using Community Outreach and Evidenced-Based Treatment to Address Domestic Violence Issue

Author: Puccia, Ellen; Redding, Terry M; Brown, Rebecca S; Gwynne, Patricia A; Hirsh, Allegra B; Hoffmann Frances, Rebecca J; Morrison, Betsy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1221408351?accountid=14925

Abstract: Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is one evidence-based treatment for post-traumatic stress (PTS) that has shown great promise. The Children's Initiative has used this treatment model successfully to alleviate symptoms of PTS as a result of witnessing domestic violence. When this treatment model is used within a cohesive community structure with maximum inclusion of all local agencies and coordinated referral efforts, it is highly effective as a response to domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

African Americans and Teen Dating Violence

Author: Henry, Racine Renee1; Zeytinoglu, Senem1 Couple and Family Therapy Program, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1266144917?accountid=14925

Abstract: This literature review focuses on the prevalence rates of teen dating violence in the United States, emergence of dating violence research, reasons of teen dating violence in the African American community, consequences of it regarding physical and mental health, and the impact of it on psychological and physical health. The research shows a trickledown effect of racism, low socio-economic status, and growing up in poor neighborhoods leading to domestic violence in African American families, which then gets reinforced with messages received from peers and the media.

Ethical Dilemmas of a Clinician/Researcher interviewing Women who Have Grown Up in a Family Where There Was Domestic Violence

Author: Scerri, Clarissa Sammut1; Abela, Angela; Vetere, Arlene1 Department of Psychology, University of Malta, Malta

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705559?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper attempts to illuminate some of the ethical dilemmas of a clinician/researcher interviewing women about a sensitive topic- their experience of having witnessed domestic violence in the family they grew up in, as part of a grounded theory study. Vignettes are presented to illustrate the self-reflexive process of the researcher and how she understood the effects of the interview process on her and the participants. The authors argue that doing in-depth qualitative research interviewing is an intervention in the life of the participants, especially, but not only, when the researchers are clinically-trained. However, this clinical training may also be an important resource from which to draw from, to act ethically and understand some of the complexity of the interaction between researcher and participants.

Women's Perceptions of Safety and Risk Following Police Intervention for Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Dichter, Melissa E1; Gelles, Richard J1 Philadelphia VA Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/993378856?accountid=14925

Abstract: Police intervention is a primary response to intimate partner violence (IPV) but does not guarantee a victim's future safety. This study sought to identify factors associated with IPV survivors' perceptions of safety and risk of revictimization following police intervention. One hundred sixty-four women completed a questionnaire, and 11 of those women also took part in qualitative interviews. The findings revealed that feeling unsafe and perceiving oneself to be at risk of future violence is associated with experiencing particular forms of IPV, including battering, lethality threats, and sexual violence. Having support from others and distance from the partner helps women feel safe.

Situational Ambiguity and Gendered Patterns of Arrest for Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Durfee, Alesha11 Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023030722?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using data from the 2005 National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), this analysis focuses on the impacts that domestic violence mandatory arrest policies have on arrest outcomes in "situationally ambiguous" cases: cases where both the female and male partners have been identified by police as both a victim and an offender. Results indicate that although officers arrest male partners more frequently than female partners, after controlling for incident and individual factors, mandatory arrest policies disproportionately affect women. Furthermore, correlates of arrest differ for male-only arrests versus female-only arrests. These findings are discussed in the context of changing legal responses to domestic violence.

Back to Basics: Essential Qualities of Services for Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Kulkarni, Shanti J1; Bell, Holly; Rhodes, Diane McDaniel1 University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023030725?accountid=14925

Abstract: Survivor voice is essential to effectively implement survivor-focused IPV (intimate partner violence) services. In this focus group study, domestic violence survivors (n = 30) shared detailed perspectives as service seekers and recipients, whereas national hotline advocates (n = 24) explored relationships between service providers and survivors based on their interactions with both. Four thematic categories related to enhancing IPV services emerged: providing empathy, supporting empowerment, individualizing care, and maintaining ethical boundaries. Advocates identified additional factors that interfered with quality services, including the following: inadequate organizational resources, staff burnout, lack of training, and poor integration with other community resources. Respectful, empowering relationships are the centerpiece for quality IPV services. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

The Attenuating Effect of Empowerment on IPV-Related PTSD Symptoms in Battered Women Living in Domestic Violence Shelters

Author: Perez, Sara1; Johnson, Dawn M; Wright, Caroline Vaile1 Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center, OH USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023030763?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with significant psychological distress, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, factors that attenuate the impact of IPV on PTSD remain largely unknown. Using hierarchical regression, this investigation explored the impact of resource acquisition and empowerment on the relationship between IPV and PTSD. Empowerment demonstrated greater relative importance over resource acquisition. Specifically, empowerment was found to attenuate the impact of IPV severity on PTSD at low and moderate levels of violence. The importance of fostering empowerment and addressing PTSD in addition to provision of resources in battered women is discussed.

Adapting Dating Violence Prevention to Francophone Switzerland: A Story of Intra-Western Cultural Differences

Author: Hamby, Sherry1; Nix, Kaki; De Puy, Jacqueline; Monnier, Sylvie1 University of the South, Department of Psychology, SPO 1123, Sewanee, TN 37383 sherry.hamby@sewanee.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1081861600?accountid=14925

Abstract: Dating violence prevention programs, which originated in the United States, are beginning to be implemented elsewhere. This article presents the first adaptation of a violence prevention program for a European culture, Francophone Switzerland. A U.S. dating violence prevention program, Safe Dates (Foshee & Langwick, 1994), was reviewed in 19 youth and 4 professional focus groups. The most fundamental program concepts-"dating" and "violence"-are not the same in Switzerland and the United States. Swiss youth were not very focused on establishing monogamous romantic relationships, and there is no ready translation for "dating." Violence has not become the focus of a social movement in Switzerland to the same extent that it has in the United States, and distinctions among terms such as "dating violence" and "domestic violence" are not well known. Psychoeducational approaches are also less common in the Swiss context. As the movement to prevent violence extends worldwide, these issues need greater consideration. Adapted from the source document.

Examining Gender Differences in the Relationship Between Dating Violence Victimization and Anger in College Students

Author: Rutter, Lauren A1; Weatherill, Robin P; Taft, Casey T; Orazem, Robert J1 National Center for PTSD, Behavioral Sciences Division, VA Boston Healthcare System (116B-4), 150 South Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02130-4893

Abstract: It has been well established that dating violence victimization is associated with various mental health problems. Relatively, little is known about similarities and differences between mental health correlates of dating violence victimization for males and females. We examined the associations between physical and psychological victimization experiences and measures of anger in a sample of 200 male and female undergraduates. Results suggest that men's victimization was more strongly associated with different forms of anger than women's victimization. Adapted from the source document.

Approaches Used by Employee Assistance Programs to Address Perpetration of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Hardison Walters, Jennifer L1; Pollack, Keshia M; Clinton-Sherrod, Monique; Lindquist, Christine H; McKay, Tasseli; Lasater, Beth M1 MSW, RTI International, P.O. Box 12194, 3040 Cornwallis Rd., Research Triangle Park, NC

Abstract: Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) are workplace resources available to employees with problems impacting work performance. EAPs are well-positioned to address intimate partner violence (IPV), a major public health problem with workplace impacts. A purposeful sample of 28 EAPs across the United States was surveyed to identify policies and programs to address IPV, including perpetration. Most EAPs did not report having standardized approaches for addressing IPV perpetration. EAPs also described significant barriers to identifying IPV perpetrators, with the majority relying on self-disclosure on the part of the perpetrator when contacting the EAP. These results suggest that many EAPs-even when interacting with employees who present with issues known to correlate with IPV-are missing a potential opportunity to assess and intervene with IPV perpetrators. Adapted from the source document.

Examining the Relationship Between Latinas' Perceptions About What Constitutes Domestic Violence and Domestic Violence Victimization

Author: Kulkarni, Shanti J1; Racine, Elizabeth F; Ramos, Blanca1 Department of Social Work, 9201 University City Blvd., Charlotte, NC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1221407310?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence is a serious issue for U.S. Latinas. Better understanding of the potential risk or protection that cultural perceptions about what constitutes domestic violence may convey can help strengthen interventions. Therefore, a convenience sample of 93 Latinas was surveyed about their current levels of domestic violence victimization, acculturation, and demographics, as well as about whether 5 behavioral scenarios constituted domestic violence. Hierarchical multiple regressions were performed to examine the relationships between the 5 perception items and domestic violence victimization. After adjusting for established risk factors, only viewing male partner stalking and female verbal aggression as domestic violence were significantly associated with decreased domestic violence victimization. Findings can be integrated into the development and implementation of culturally competent interventions targeting Latinas. Adapted from the source document.

Dating Violence: Mental Health Consequences Based on Type of Abuse

Author: Eshelman, Lee1; Levendosky, Alytia A1 49333 Peninsular Drive, Belleville, MI

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1221408375?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study aims to determine the relationship between psychological, physical, and sexual abuse, and mental health symptoms. Female college students (N = 499) completed anonymous online surveys to report experiences of abuse, as well as symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and physical injuries. Five groups of participants were found: no abuse; psychological abuse; physical abuse; psychological and physical abuse; and psychological, physical, and sexual abuse. The multiple abuse groups showed the highest rate of mental health symptoms. In addition, increased frequency of abuse was related to more mental health symptoms and more physical injuries. Adapted from the source document.

Gender Differences in Attitudinal Acceptance of Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration Under Attachment-Relevant Contexts

Author: Valdez, Christine E1; Lilly, Michelle M; Sandberg, David A1 Northern Illinois University, Department of Psychology, PM 400, DeKalb, IL cvaldez@niu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1221408382?accountid=14925

Abstract: Attachment theory has been one of the leading theoretical frameworks in the last few decades for explaining physical violence within romantic relationships. In this study, the authors examined differences in attachment patterns and attitudinal acceptance of violence perpetrated in romantic relationships among men and women. The Attitudinal Acceptance of Intimate Partner Violence questionnaire was developed to measure acceptance of intimate partner violence (IPV) under attachment-relevant contexts of abandonment, as well as other contexts identified in the literature. Results indicated that men with higher degrees of attachment anxiety were more accepting of both male- and female-perpetrated IPV under contexts of abandonment, and men with higher degrees of attachment avoidance were more accepting of female-perpetrated IPV under contexts of abandonment. Implications for research and treatment are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Examining the Nexus Between Domestic Violence and Animal Abuse in a National Sample of Service Providers

Author: Krienert, Jessie L1; Walsh, Jeffrey A; Matthews, Kevin; McConkey, Kelly1 Department of Criminal Justice Sciences, Illinois State University, Campus Box 5250, Normal, IL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1221408410?accountid=14925

Abstract: Companion animals play a complex role in families impacted by violence. An outlet of emotional support for victims, the family pet often becomes a target for physical abuse. Results from a comprehensive e-survey of domestic violence shelters nationwide (N = 767) highlight both improvements and existing gaps in service provision for domestic violence victims and their pets. Quantitative and qualitative data noted frequently encountered obstacles to successful shelter seeking by abuse victims with companion animals including a lack of availability, funding, space, and reliable programming. Although results indicate an overall improvement in organizational awareness, fewer than half of surveyed shelters include intake questions about animals. Continued awareness and an expansion of services is needed to create viable safety planning strategies and reliable alternatives for women with companion animals in order to improve the likelihood that abuse victims will seek escape and refuge for themselves, their children, and their pets. Adapted from the source document.

Patterns of Intimate Partner Violence in Young Adult Couples: Nonviolent, Unilaterally Violent, and Mutually Violent Couples

Author: Marcus, Robert F

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705103?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined nonviolent (NV), unilaterally violent (UV), and mutually violent (MV) patterns of perpetrated intimate partner violence in relation to dyadic relationship quality and partner injury. The respondents were 1,294 young adult, Add Health partners (AHP) and their non-Add Health partners (NAHP), in dating, engaged, or in marital relationships, who were participants in Wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Using both partner reports of perpetration to classify intimate partner violence (IPV) patterns resulted in 25% of couples with a MV pattern, and 75% of couples with a UV pattern; among those couples (41%) reporting any perpetrated IPV. Results also showed poorer relationship quality and higher partner sensation-seeking scores among MV and UV couples when contrasted with NV couples. Those couples with MV patterns were more likely to contain partner injury than those with UV patterns. Adapted from the source document.

Coping With Dating Violence as a Function of Violence Frequency and Solution Attribution: A Structural Modeling Approach

Author: Bapat, Mona; Tracey, Terence J G

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364699567?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study presents a structural model of coping with dating violence. The model integrates abuse frequency and solution attribution to relate to college women's choices of coping strategies. Three hundred and twenty-four undergraduate women reported being targets of some physical abuse from a boyfriend and responded to questions regarding the abuse, their solution attribution, and their coping behaviors. Solution attribution mediated the relation between frequency of the abuse and coping.

Abstract: This phenomenological qualitative study examines intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by a sample of 29 Mexican immigrant women residing in New York and St. Louis. The findings reveal important insights about culturally specific abuse tactics employed by batterers and the forms of abuse that are experienced as most hurtful to the survivors. Ten different abusive tactics emerged: verbal, economic, physical, sexual, and extended family abuse, social isolation, physical abuse of children, stalking and monitoring, stolen bride, and sex trafficking. Cultural values and expectations appear to be inextricably linked to how the participants characterized the severity of each of the abusive tactics as evidenced by which abusive behaviors the participants found most hurtful. The findings will help service providers have a better understanding of the role cultural context plays in the IPV experiences of Mexican immigrant women. Adapted from the source document.

The Relationship Between Dating Violence and Suicidal Behaviors in a National Sample of Adolescents

Author: Belshaw, Scott H1; Siddique, Julie Ahmad; Tanner, Jennifer; Osho, G Solomon1 University of North Texas, Department of Criminal Justice, 1155 Union Circle #305130, Denton, TX 76203 scott.belshaw@unt.edu

Abstract: Relationship violence is a common problem faced by adolescents in the United States. In general, adolescents are at higher risk for relationship victimization than adults (Silverman, Raj, Mucci, & Hathaway, 2001), and females between the ages of 16 and 24 years are at the highest risk of relationship victimization (Rennison, 2001). This study uses data from the 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance (YRBSS) System (or referred to as Youth Risk Behavior Survey [YRBS]; N = 11,781) of adolescents between the ages of 14 and 17 years to estimate two logistic regression models on the association between relationship violence and suicidal behaviors controlling for variables such as sexual assault and drug use. The findings indicated that victimized adolescents are at higher risk for planning and/or attempting suicide compared to nonvictimized adolescents. Implications for research and practice are explored. Adapted from the source document.

An Examination of General Aggression and Intimate Partner Violence in Women With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

Author: Kirby, Angela C; Beckham, Jean C; Calhoun, Patrick S; Roberts, Sushma T; Taft, Casey T; Elbogen, Eric B; Dennis, Michelle F

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1315603865?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research has documented significant relationships between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), aggression, and intimate partner violence (IPV). Most of these studies have focused on men and measured violence by self-report. This study examined (a) the association between PTSD and general aggression among women, (b) the association between IPV and PTSD among married and/or cohabitating couples, and (c) the concordance between self and collateral reports of IPV. One hundred twenty participants provided information about PTSD symptoms and general aggression toward others, and 43 married and/or cohabitating couples provided information about PTSD and IPV. Women with PTSD reported more general aggression, IPV perpetration, and IPV victimization. Collateral informants of those with and without PTSD did not differ significantly in their report of IPV. Concordance between participants and spouses or partners was low to moderate. These results are discussed within the context of extant IPV literature. Adapted from the source document.

Assessing the Relationship Between Alcohol Outlets and Domestic Violence: Routine Activities and the Neighborhood Environment

Author: Roman, Caterina G; Reid, Shannon E

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1315603869?accountid=14925

Abstract: Studies have consistently found a positive relationship between alcohol outlet density and assault, but only a handful of studies have examined whether outlet density has an influence on domestic violence. Using a framework based in crime opportunity theories, this study estimates spatial econometric regression models to test whether the density of alcohol outlets across neighborhoods is positively associated with police calls for service for domestic violence. Models also were developed to test whether the relationships found were consistent across time periods associated with the use of alcohol outlets (weeknights and weekends). The findings indicate that off-premise outlets were associated with a significant increase in domestic violence, but on-premise outlets (specifically restaurants and nightclubs) were associated with a decrease in domestic violence. The risk for domestic violence in areas of high densities of off-premise outlets was found to be high during the weekend but not during the weeknight, suggesting different routine activities for domestic violence offenders during the week. Adapted from the source document.

Safety Planning With Children and Adolescents in Domestic Violence Shelters

Author: Chanmugam, Amy1; Hall, Kimberly1 LCSW, University of Texas at San Antonio, Social Work Department, 501 W. Cesar Chavez Blvd., San Antonio, TX 78207-4415

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347781316?accountid=14925

Abstract: This exploratory mixed methods survey yielded a comprehensive picture of safety planning practices with children and adolescents in Texas emergency domestic violence shelters. Shelter personnel described safety planning goals, methods, timing, and contents and views of best practices, barriers, and risks. The study's approach was guided by Proctor's (2005) recommendations for developing the research base for an understudied intervention. Results indicate that the practice is widespread. Shelters consider developmental differences and use multiple methods and timing strategies. Views on goals and risks varied. Findings are contextualized with information on overall child/youth services. This article discusses implications for shelter practices and future research, such as outcome studies and the feasibility of children/youth implementing commonly recommended safety strategies. Adapted from the source document.

Promising Practices in the Prevention of Intimate Partner Violence Among Adolescents

Author: De Grace, Alyssa1; Clarke, Angela1 Department of Psychology, West Chester University, West Chester, PA 19383

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347785977?accountid=14925

Abstract: To inform practitioners and researchers interested in the prevention of intimate partner violence (IPV) among adolescents, 9 principles of effective prevention programs (Nation et al., 2003) were described and examples of how these principles have been incorporated into existing teen dating violence prevention programs were provided. An investigation of current prevention practices for adolescent IPV resulted in one noteworthy program that has successfully incorporated all 9 principles of effective prevention programming-Safe Dates (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices [SAMHSA-NREPP], 2006). Although Safe Dates serves as a model teen dating violence prevention program, it may not be equally effective across contexts and diverse groups. Therefore, as researchers and practitioners continue to develop and refine programs to reduce adolescent IPV, the principles of effective prevention programs should serve as a guiding framework. Adapted from the source document.

Evaluating Preschool Children's Attitudes and Beliefs About Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Howell, Kathryn H1; Miller, Laura E; Graham-Bermann, Sandra A1 Department of Psychiatry, Child and Adolescent Section, Rachel Upjohn Building, 4250 Plymouth Road, SPC 5766, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-5766 howellkh@med.umich.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347784833?accountid=14925

Abstract: Few studies have considered how intimate partner violence (IPV) impacts children's overarching attitudes and beliefs about the prevalence and acceptability of aggression. This pilot study included 92 preschool children exposed to IPV who reported on attitudes and beliefs about violence using a new, theoretically driven measure. Findings illustrate that preschoolers were able to respond reliably on this measure, and that most report at least one maladaptive attitude or belief about violence. Maternal posttraumatic avoidance symptoms, increased child aggression, and decreased child self-blame were associated with maladaptive attitudes and beliefs. These findings, although preliminary, indicate that clinicians may need to address both children's individual adjustment following violence exposure as well as their attitudes and beliefs concerning the acceptability of violence in interpersonal relationships. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Using both academic theories and two decades of experience in community, this article presents the work conducted by Caminar Latino (Latino Journey), a comprehensive intervention for Latino families affected by domestic violence. Having developed in both analogous and independent ways from theories in the academic field, Caminar Latino provides a unique opportunity to explore ways in which ecological theory and tenets of feminist therapy can be combined within a social justice framework to address this severe social problem. Of particular relevance to therapists, advocates and others working in this field is the ongoing inclusion of the voices of women participants as a central tenet of the intervention.

Adverse Childhood Experiences of referred children exposed to Intimate Partner Violence: Consequences for their wellbeing

Author: Lamers-Winkelman, Francien1; Willemen, Agnes M; Visser, Margreet1 Children's and Youth Trauma Centre, Haarlem, The Netherlands

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023025991?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study investigated the relationships among Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) in a high risk clinical sample of Dutch children whose mothers were abused by an intimate partner, and the severity of behavioral and emotional problems and trauma symptoms. The study population comprised 208 children (M=7.81 years, SD=2.39, range 2-12) who were referred to mental health and welfare institutions after reported Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). At intake, caregivers, children, and teachers completed questionnaires on Adverse Childhood Experiences, behavior and emotional problems, and trauma symptoms. The results showed that child witnesses of IPV were also exposed to other adverse experiences, such as abuse, household dysfunction and neglect. The mean number of ACEs was 5.08 (range 2-9). Twenty percent of the children in this sample experienced seven ACEs or more. The number of ACEs children were exposed to was unrelated to the level of emotional and behavioral problems, except for trauma related symptoms reported by parents. This study shows that children who witnessed Intimate Partner Violence were also exposed to other adverse experiences. The results of this study may imply that in this high-risk clinical sample of children exposed to IPV, additional adverse experiences have a limited relationship to psychological outcomes. A thorough assessment and inclusion of all Adverse Childhood Experiences is necessary for a comprehensive treatment program. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

Assessing PTSD and resilience for females who during childhood were exposed to domestic violence

Author: Anderson, Kim M1; Bang, Eun-Jun1 Associate Professor, School of Social Work, the University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1550997491?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined 68 females, who as children were exposed to domestic violence, to explore childhood risk and protective factors and their relationship to adult levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and resilience. Independent sample t-tests indicated significant differences in PTSD levels between participants with and without police involvement during childhood. There were also significant differences in PTSD levels between participants who reported their mothers had mental-health problems with those who did not. Additionally, participants whose mothers had full-time steady employment had significantly higher resilience than those with mothers who did not work or worked inconsistently. Implications include advancing ecological theory and conceptual insights regarding childhood risk and protective factors and their association to adult psychological distress and hardiness for daughters exposed to their mothers' intimate partner violence.

Intimate Partner Violence during Pregnancy: Best Practices for Social Workers

Author: McMahon, Sarah; Armstrong, D'edra Y

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283643304?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy is a major problem in the United States, with estimates that 3 percent to 17 percent of women experience violence during the perinatal period. Research indicates that IPV during pregnancy is associated with serious, negative health outcomes for the mother and her unborn child. As such, many researchers have suggested that pregnancy offers a unique window for IPV intervention, particularly for social workers in health-care settings. Although assessing for IPV more generally has received increased attention in the social work literature, there is a lack of information about the specific needs for pregnant women. Thus, the purpose of this article is to provide a focused literature review on the scope and impact of IPV during pregnancy and to identify best practices for social workers for intervention and prevention. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence and Coparenting Across the Transition to Parenthood

Author: Kan, Marni L1; Feinberg, Mark E; Solmeyer, Anna R1 RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919376984?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) between parents has been linked to negative parenting and child maladjustment, yet the mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood. Based on a theory that violence among parents disrupts the coparental alliance-which has been linked to parenting quality and child adjustment-the authors examined the effect of prebirth violence on coparenting across the transition to parenthood. A community sample of 156 couples reported on IPV prior to the birth of their first child and on coparenting at child age 1 year. Both men and women's violence perpetration were related to coparenting quality. Couple relationship quality and parent mental health problems accounted for the links between prenatal IPV and coparenting. This study adds to an understanding of the associations between IPV and family functioning across the transition to parenthood, and has important implications for preventive intervention.

Maternal parenting as a mediator of the relationship between intimate partner violence and effortful control.

Author: Gustafsson, Hanna C1; Cox, Martha J; Blair, Clancy1 Center for Developmental Science, The University of North Carolina

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023025983?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study examined the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV), maternal parenting behaviors, and child effortful control in a diverse sample of 705 families living in predominantly low-income, rural communities. Using structural equation modeling, the authors simultaneously tested whether observed sensitive parenting and/or harsh-intrusive parenting over the toddler years mediated the relationship between early IPV and later effortful control. Results suggest that parenting behaviors fully mediate this relationship. Although higher levels of IPV were associated with both higher levels of harsh-intrusive parenting and lower levels of sensitive supportive parenting, only sensitive supportive parenting was associated with later effortful control when both parenting indices were considered in the same model.

Preferences for Police Response to Domestic Violence: A Comparison of College Students in Three Chinese Societies

Author: Sun, Ivan Y1; Wu, Yuning; Huang, Lanying; Lin, Yushen; Li, Jessica C M; Su, Mingyue1 Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, 19716, USA isun@udel.edu

Abstract: While a large amount of research has been conducted in the West on domestic violence related issues, only a small number of studies have focused specifically on Chinese societies. Using survey data collected from Beijing, Hong Kong, and Taipei, this study compares college students' preferences for traditional and proactive police intervention into domestic violence and assesses the determinants of such preferences in the three Chinese societies. The findings indicate that Hong Kong students showed the highest level of support for traditional police response, followed by students in Beijing and Taipei, while students in Taipei displayed the strongest preference for proactive police response, followed by students in Hong Kong and Beijing. College students' preferences for traditional police response were shaped mainly by their locality, whereas their preferences for proactive police intervention were influenced chiefly by their attitudes toward violence and gender roles. Directions for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Predicting the Risk of Intimate Partner Violence: The Chinese Risk Assessment Tool for Victims

Author: Chan, Ko Ling11 Department of Social Work and Social Administration, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, eklchan@hkucc.hku.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/993496344?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study reports the development and validation of the Chinese Risk Assessment Tool for Victims (CRAT-V), an actuarial instrument for the prediction of intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization in a Chinese population. Data were collected from a representative sample of 2,708 Chinese women who were married or cohabiting in Hong Kong. All participants were interviewed with a questionnaire assessing their experience of IPV victimization and personal or family factors related to IPV. As measured by the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS 2), the base rates of preceding-year physical and sexual IPV victimization were 4.6 % and 3.6 %, respectively. Using a cross-validation procedure, the present study developed a 5-factor instrument with one half of the randomly split sample and validated the resulting tool with the other half. The CRAT-V had a sensitivity of 74.0 %, a specificity of 68.3 %, an overall accuracy of 68.7 %, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.75 when administered on the second half of sample. Overall, the CRAT-V may serve as a straightforward, systematic, and easy-to-administer instrument tailor-made for Chinese populations for the assessment of risk of IPV victimization against women.

Abstract: Whereas cognitive variables are hypothesized to play an important role in intimate partner violence (IPV) etiology and intervention, cognitive assessment methods have largely targeted offenders' explicit, controlled cognitive processing using paper-and-pencil questionnaires prone to social desirability biases. Using an implicit measure of attitudes (the Implicit Association Test [IAT]), we assessed attitudes toward gender, violence, and the association between gender and violence among 50 men enrolled in an IPV treatment program and a comparison sample of 40 nonviolent (NV) men. Although no group differences were noted on explicit attitudinal measures, men in the IPV group showed more positive implicit attitudes regarding violence, and a more rapid association between women and violence. Among men in treatment for IPV, the attitudes toward violence IAT was significantly correlated with self/partner-reported IPV frequency. In accordance with social information processing models of aggression, these results suggest that aggressogenic attitudes are likely to operate automatically and with little conscious deliberation. As a result, clinicians and researchers must adapt assessment and intervention strategies to capture both implicit and explicit aspects of cognitive processing.

Predictors of Preschoolers' Appraisals of Conflict in Families Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Miller, Laura E1; Howell, Kathryn H; Graham-Bermann, Sandra A1 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925148207?accountid=14925

Abstract: Factors that may contribute to preschool-aged children's appraisals of their parent's violent conflicts in families experiencing recent intimate partner violence (IPV) were evaluated for 116 mother-child dyads. Mothers and children were interviewed using empirically-validated measures to assess level of violence, maternal and child mental health, and children's appraisals of conflict. Results suggest that preschool-aged children are able to meaningfully respond to statements about their parents' conflicts. Both mothers' and children's reports of violence were significantly associated with children's appraisals of Threat, but not with appraisals of Self-blame. Girls reported significantly higher levels of Self-blame than did boys. Children's cognitive appraisals of Threat and Self-blame did not vary by age or ethnicity. These findings suggest that interventions designed for young children might specifically target their cognitive appraisals to help them regulate their feelings of being threatened and to provide for their safety.

State Employment Protection Statutes for Victims of Domestic Violence: Public Policy's Response to Domestic Violence as an Employment Matter

Author: Swanberg, Jennifer E1; Ojha, Mamta U; Macke, Caroline1 College of Social Work, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925201237?accountid=14925

Abstract: Evidence indicates that domestic violence has negative consequences on victims' employment; yet employers lag in recognizing this as a workplace issue. To address the problem, some states have established several policy solutions. To understand the scope of the public sector's response to domestic violence as a workplace issue, a content analysis of state-level employment protection policies for domestic violence victims (N = 369) was conducted. Results indicate three broad policy categories: (a) policies that offer work leave for victims; (b) policies that aim to reduce employment discrimination of domestic violence victims; and (c) policies that aim to increase awareness and safety in the workplace. Subcategories emerged within each of these three categories. Implementation of employment protection policies varies significantly across states. Implications for workplaces, practitioners, and policy leaders are discussed.

Assessment and management of risk for intimate partner violence by police officers using the Spousal Assault Risk Assessment Guide

Author: Belfrage, Henrik; Strand, Susanne; Storey, Jennifer E; Gibas, Andrea L; Kropp, P Randall; Hart, Stephen D

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1641424296?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a crime that is present in all countries, seriously impacts victims, and demands a great deal of time and resources from the criminal justice system. The current study examined the use of the Spousal Assault Risk Assessment Guide, 2nd ed. (SARA; Kropp, Hart, Webster, & Eaves, 1995), a structured professional judgment risk assessment and management tool for IPV, by police officers in Sweden over a follow-up of 18 months. SARA risk assessments had significant predictive validity with respect to risk management recommendations made by police, as well as with recidivism as indexed by subsequent contacts with police. Risk management mediated the association between risk assessment and recidivism: High levels of intervention were associated with decreased recidivism in high risk cases, but with increased recidivism in low risk cases. The findings support the potential utility of police-based risk assessment and management of IPV, and in particular the belief that appropriately structured risk assessment and management decisions can prevent violence. Adapted from the source document.

Intimate Partner Violence/Abuse and Depressive Symptoms among Female Health Care Workers: Longitudinal Findings

Author: La Flair, Lareina N; Bradshaw, Catherine P; Campbell, Jacquelyn C

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1429626431?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence and abuse (IPV/A) have been shown to have a major impact on mental health functioning. This study assessed the longitudinal association between recent IPV/A and depressive symptoms to identify potential targets for preventive interventions for women. Random effects models were used to examine four waves of data collected at 6-month intervals from a cohort of 1,438 female health care workers. IPV/A (e.g., sexual and physical violence, psychological abuse) in the past 5 years was associated with higher Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) 10 scores across four waves after adjustment for age, time, marital status, and childhood trauma. Women who reported IPV/A in the past 5 years had higher CES-D 10 scores ([beta], 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.82; p < .0001) than nonabused women. This association was generally constant with time, suggestive of a cross-sectional association across all four waves of data. Additionally, recent IPV/A was associated with change in depressive symptoms over time among the full cohort and those with CES-D 10 scores below 10 (the threshold for likely depression) at baseline. Recent IPV/A was independently associated with depressive symptoms both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The longitudinal association was stronger among those not depressed at baseline. Implications for health care settings and workplace policies addressing IPV/A are discussed. [Copyright Jacobs Institute of Women's Health; published by Elsevier Science Inc.]

Child welfare policy and practice on children's exposure to domestic violence

Author: Cross, Theodore P1; Mathews, Ben; Tonmyr, Lil; Scott, Debbie; Ouimet, Catherine1 Children and Family Research Center, School of Social Work, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1010 W. Nevada St., Urbana, IL 61801, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283640504?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reviews research, policy and programming in Australia, Canada and the US on the child welfare response to EDV. The review draws on searches of standard research databases, interviews with researchers and practitioners, and the authors' own research. Although EDV is underreported, across studies 7% to 23% of youths in general population surveys experienced EDV, 36-39% of youth in DV cases have witnessed the violence, and 45-46% of primary caregivers in child maltreatment investigations have experienced DV. Mandatory reporting can increase the number of cases that come to the attention of child welfare, but without resources for training and programming can lead to inappropriate reports, lack of referral for further assessment, and strains on the child welfare system. Improving the child welfare response to EDV can include collaboration between child welfare workers and DV advocates; increased training on screening for DV; new protocols on DV; and dedicated DV staffing within child welfare agencies. In recent years, policy and program attention to EDV has also been embedded within broader national efforts to protect children from violence and maltreatment. Differential response models that eschew investigation in favor of assessment and service delivery hold promise for families with DV. Empirical data are limited, but current research and practice experience suggest that child welfare agencies seeking to improve the response to EDV should collaborate with other disciplines involved with preventing and responding to DV, seek resources to support training and programming, consider methods that avoid stigmatizing parents, and build in a program evaluation component to increase knowledge about effective practice.

The Importance of Therapist/Client Ethnic/Racial Matching in Couples Treatment for Domestic Violence

Author: Horst, Kyle1; Mendez, Marcos; Culver-Turner, Rebecca; Amanor-Boadu, Yvonne; Minner, Bo; Cook, Josh; Stith, Sandra; McCollum, Eric1 Marriage and Family Therapy Program, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1030866999?accountid=14925

Abstract: Outcome research indicates a relative degree of variability regarding the effectiveness of client and therapist ethnic/racial matching (see Cabral and Smith 2011; Shin et al. in J Couns Psychol 52(1):45-56, 2005). Considering these findings, our study hopes to further understand the complexity behind ethnic/racial matching in treatment. In this study, we examined interviews with clients and therapists regarding ethnic/racial matching in couples treatment for domestic violence (e.g., McCollum and Stith in Violence Vict 23(2):187-201, 2008). Our findings indicated that ethnic/racial matching is a complex multi-faceted issue and connected ethnic/racial matching with issues of culture, human experience, and others. We recommend clinicians consider the complexity of ethnic/racial matching in practice. Adapted from the source document.

Ritual and Performance in Domestic Violence Healing: From Survivor to Thriver Through Rites of Passage

Author: Wozniak, Danielle F1; Allen, Karen Neuman1 University of Montana, Missoula, MT, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1125219472?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes a group for domestic violence survivors to help them move past a "liminal" state in which their social identity is characterized by being "victim" or "survivor" to one of "incorporation" defined by "thriving" and joy. Through the creation and use of healing rituals, blessings, poetry, art and music, the women in the group establish "communitas" and support each other in the work of self-reclamation and healing. The group, "Rites of Passage" is intended for women who have completed shelter-based crisis interventions, and uses a structured curriculum that integrates theoretical and philosophical concepts from anthropology, post-modernism, humanistic psychology, social work, and existentialism. Through the Rites of Passage group, women identify and traverse a healing trajectory to construct an identity founded on strength and fulfillment. Patterned after non-western sex-segregated rites of transition, those who go through the group celebrate its conclusion with a defining ritual that publically marks their change in identity and status.

Abstract: This study aimed at investigating psychological health problems experienced by working women as a result of their experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV). One hundred one working women participated in the study. Results indicated that nearly half of the participants reported partner violence. Compared with nonabused women, abused women showed significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms (t (78) = -3.4, p = .001) and stress (t (93) = -4.8, p < .0001), while self-esteem did not differ significantly between the two groups. Acknowledgment of this problem and early recognition of the victims may result in improving the health of working women in Jordan. Adapted from the source document.

Seizing an Opportunity to Help-Knowledge and Attitudes of Doctors and Nurses Toward Women Victimized by Intimate Partner Violence in Brazil

Author: Vieira, Elisabeth Meloni1; dos Santos, Manoel Antonio; Ford, Nicholas John1 Faculdade de Medicina, Ribeirao Preto Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1125224375?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this study we combined quantitative (questionnaire survey of 221 health care professionals [HCPs]) and qualitative (interviews with 14 doctors) methods to explore knowledge and attitudes toward health service assistance for women victims of intimate partner violence (IPV). Data were collected in Ribeirao Preto, Brazil, in 2007. We found that most HCPs presented good knowledge of definitions of gender violence, but they had low awareness of its local prevalence, sympathetic attitudes to such women, but highlighted a range of barriers to assisting them. We analyzed these findings in relation to sex, age, profession, and years of experience. Adapted from the source document.

Provider Barriers and Facilitators to Screening for Intimate Partner Violence in Bogota, Colombia

Author: Baig, Arshiya A1; Ryan, Gery W; Rodriguez, Michael A1 Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1125220887?accountid=14925

Abstract: We conducted interviews with 27 health care personnel in Bogota, Colombia, to examine provider barriers and facilitators to screening for intimate partner violence (IPV). We used systematic qualitative analysis to identify the range and consistency of beliefs. We found that respondents did not routinely screen for IPV. Providers listed numerous barriers to screening. Ways to improve screening included increased clinician training, installing systematic IPV screening, providing patient education, and implementing health care setting interventions. Improving the care for IPV survivors will involve translating health care personnel preferred solutions into more systematic IPV screening interventions. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence Among Iraqi Refugees in Syria

Author: Tappis, Hannah1; Biermann, Elizabeth; Glass, Nancy; Tileva, Margarita; Doocy, Shannon1 Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 615 N. Wolfe Street, Suite E8132, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1221408257?accountid=14925

Abstract: A domestic violence questionnaire was administered to 701 adult females in a sample of 813 Iraqi households in Syria; unmarried women and women whose husbands were away were excluded, yielding a final sample of 486. Lifetime physical, verbal, or emotional abuse was reported by 30%, and approximately 20% experienced abuse within the past year. Non-Damascus residence, children <18 years in the household, no financial challenges upon arrival, and borrowing money in Syria were associated with increased risk of domestic violence within the past year. Support services are inadequate and should be expanded; and longer-term prevention measures also should be implemented. Adapted from the source document.

Past Victimizations and Dating Violence Perpetration in Adolescence: The Mediating Role of Emotional Distress and Hostility

Author: Boivin, Sophie1; Lavoie, Francine; Hebert, Martine; Gagne, Marie-Helene1 Ecole de psychologie, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/926768415?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study aimed to understand the nature of the relationships between three forms of past victimizations (exposure to interparental violence in childhood, sexual harassment by peers since beginning high school, prior experience of dating violence), physical dating violence perpetration by adolescents, and anger-hostility and emotional distress. The sample was composed of 1,259 high school students aged between 14 and 19 years who answered self-report questionnaires. Mediation analyses were conducted according to Baron and Kenny's approach. Logistic and linear regression analyses reveal that being victim of sexual harassment by peers and of dating violence are associated to physical dating violence perpetration via a partial mediating effect of hostility in girls. Contrary to results with girls, there is a complete mediating effect of emotional distress for boys. Results suggest that dating violence prevention and intervention strategies could be adapted according to gender and that sexual harassment should be addressed.

The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Women's Condom Negotiation Efficacy

Author: Swan, Holly1; O'Connell, Daniel J1 Center for Drug and Alcohol Studies, Newark, DE, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/926768169?accountid=14925

Abstract: HIV prevention efforts promote the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV and other STDs. Thus, a woman's agency to practice healthy sexual behaviors necessarily involves negotiation with another person. This poses unique challenges for women who have limited power in relationships. The current study explores how the experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) impacts a woman's confidence in her ability to negotiate condom use with a sexual partner (i.e., condom use self-efficacy), using data from incarcerated females in three states, who were interviewed just prior to release back into the community. The direct effect of experiencing IPV as an adult, controlling for other risk factors, on condom use self-efficacy has not previously been empirically tested. Results show that IPV experiences among women significantly decreases their confidence in negotiating condom use with a partner, putting them at a higher risk of HIV infection than women who do not report having recently experienced IPV.

Screening for Intimate Partner Violence in Orthopedic Patients: A Comparison of Three Screening Tools

Author: Sprague, Sheila1; Madden, Kim; Dosanjh, Sonia; Petrisor, Brad; Schemitsch, Emil H; Bhandari, Mohit1 Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010683103?accountid=14925

Abstract: Accurately identifying victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) can be a challenge for clinicians and clinical researchers. Multiple instruments have been developed and validated to identify IPV in patients presenting to health care practitioners, including the Woman Abuse Screening Tool (WAST) and the Partner Violence Screen (PVS). The purpose of the current study is to determine if female patients attending an outpatient orthopaedic fracture clinic who screen positive for IPV using three direct questions (direct questioning) also screen positive on the WAST and PVS.We conducted a prevalence study at two Level I trauma centres to determine the prevalence of IPV in female patients presenting to orthopaedic fracture clinics for treatment of injuries. We used three methods to determine the prevalence of IPV; 1) direct questioning, 2) WAST, and 3) PVS. We compared the prevalence rates across the three screening tools.Ninety-four women screened positive for IPV using any method. The prevalence of IPV was 30.5% when a direct questioning approach was utilized, 12.4% using the WAST, and 9.2% using the PVS. The WAST identified 37.2% (35/94) of the IPV victims detected and the PVS identified 27.7% (53/94) of the IPV victims detected, whereas direct questioning identified 89.4% of the IPV victims.Identification of IPV may be under-estimated by the WAST and PVS screening tools. Our findings suggest direct questioning may increase the frequency of disclosure of IPV among women attending outpatient orthopaedic clinics.

The Effects of Academic and Interpersonal Stress on Dating Violence Among College Students: A Test of Classical Strain Theory

Author: Mason, Brandon1; Smithey, Martha1 Texas Tech University, Lubbock

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010671672?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines Merton's Classical Strain Theory (1938) as a causative factor in intimate partner violence among college students. We theorize that college students experience general life strain and cumulative strain as they pursue the goal of a college degree. We test this strain on the likelihood of using intimate partner violence. Strain due to unrealistic expectations of intimate partnership and economic strain are also examined. The analysis examines the following causative factors representing strain: 1) the College Undergraduate Stress Scale (Renner & Mackin, 1998); 2) cumulative academic strain measured by college classification; 3) cumulative intimate partner strain measured as the length of time in the relationship; 4) academic strain measured by number of hours studied weekly, and 5) economic strain measured by number of hours worked weekly. Additionally, we examine the extent to which gender and race/ethnicity differentially affect intimate partner in the context of these measures of strain. The Conflict Tactics Scales II (Straus et al, 1996) are used to measure dating violence and include indicators for sexual coercion, physical aggression, injury, and psychological aggression. Data were collected from 142 students in lower-division classes from Texas Tech University. Results show that general strain and cumulative intimate partner strain increase the use of dating violence among college students. The longer dating partners are in a relationship, the higher the chances of psychological aggression, physical assault, and sexual coercion. Converse to our expectations, time spent working reduces psychological aggression due to reducing time spent together rather than reflecting economic strain.

Using I3 theory to clarify when dispositional aggressiveness predicts intimate partner violence perpetration

Author: Finkel, Eli J; DeWall, C Nathan; Slotter, Erica B; McNulty, James K; Pond, Richard S, Jr; Atkins, David C

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347785651?accountid=14925

Abstract: Deriving hypotheses from I3 theory (pronounced "I-cubed theory"), the authors conducted 4 studies to clarify the circumstances under which dispositional aggressiveness predicts intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration. Consistent with the hypothesis that this link would be stronger when inhibitory processes are weak rather than strong, Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that dispositional aggressiveness was an especially robust predictor of IPV perpetration among people experiencing self-regulatory strength depletion. Consistent with the hypothesis that this Dispositional Aggressiveness x Inhibition interaction effect would be stronger when instigating triggers are strong rather than weak, Studies 3 and 4 demonstrated that dispositional aggressiveness was an especially robust predictor of IPV perpetration among people characterized by both weak inhibition (poor executive control in Study 3, depletion in Study 4) and strong instigation (provocation in both studies). These effects were robust in studies employing experimental and nonexperimental designs, cross-sectional and longitudinal methods, dating and married participants, self-report and behavioral measures of IPV perpetration, and diverse operationalizations of all constructs. Discussion emphasizes the importance of incorporating instigating, impelling, and inhibiting processes into theoretical and empirical analyses of IPV perpetration.

A Phenomenological Study of Spirituality as a Protective Factor for Adolescents Exposed to Domestic Violence

Author: Benavides, Linda E11 Department of Social Work, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283643592?accountid=14925

Abstract: This phenomenological qualitative study was designed to understand how spirituality serves as a protective factor, mediating adverse developmental outcomes, for adolescents exposed to domestic violence. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 14 adolescents, recruited through an agency for domestic violence survivors. Four significant themes (learning from experiences, self-expression, beliefs, and feelings), through which participants' spirituality manifested as a strength, emerged. This study adds to the growing support spirituality has received as a protective factor for at-risk adolescents and provides several practice implications. Future research is also suggested to better understand the developmental process by which spirituality serves as a protective factor. Adapted from the source document.

Husband and Wife Alcohol Use as Independent or Interactive Predictors of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Testa, Maria1; Kubiak, Audrey; Quigley, Brian M; Houston, Rebecca J; Derrick, Jaye L; Levitt, Ash; Homish, Gregory G; Leonard, Kenneth E1 Research Institute on Addictions, University at Buffalo, 1021 Main Street, Buffalo, NY 14203 testa@ria.buffalo.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463025714?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: Men's heavy drinking has been established as a risk factor for their perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV); however, the role of women's drinking in their perpetration of IPV is less clear. The current study examined the relative strength of husbands' and wives' alcohol use and alcohol dependence symptoms on the occurrence and frequency of husbands' and wives' IPV perpetration. Method: Married and cohabiting community couples (N = 280) were identified and recruited according to their classification in one of four drinking groups: heavy episodic drinking occurred in both partners (n = 79), the husband only (n = 80), the wife only (n = 41), and neither (n = 80). Husband and wife alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence symptoms, and IPV perpetration were assessed independently for both partners. Results: Husband and wife consumption and alcohol dependence symptoms contributed to the likelihood and frequency of husband IPV, both independently and interactively. Husband, but not wife, alcohol dependence symptoms contributed to the occurrence of any wife IPV, although both partners' alcohol dependence symptoms predicted the frequency of wife aggression. Couples with discrepant drinking were not more likely to perpetrate IPV. Conclusions: Findings for husband IPV support previous research identifying alcohol use of both partners as a predictor. However, for wives, alcohol appears to play less of a role in IPV perpetration, perhaps reflecting that women experience less inhibition against physical aggression in their intimate relationships than do men.

Abstract: A growing body of literature has documented the global prevalence of domestic Violence Against Women of reproductive age as well as the association between violence and an array of adverse reproductive, psychosocial, and child health outcomes . However, there is a dearth of research on domestic violence prevention interventions in the peer-reviewed literature to guide program planning and policy-making efforts. In this article, the authors describe the development and assessment of the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of an intergenerational women's empowerment-based intervention to mitigate domestic violence and related adverse health outcomes in low-income urban communities in Southern India.

The Association of Intimate Partner Violence, Recreational Drug Use with HIV Seroprevalence among MSM

Author: Li, Ying1; Baker, Joseph J; Korostyshevskiy, Valeriy R; Slack, Rebecca S; Plankey, Michael W1 Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Georgetown University, 2115 Wisconsin Avenue NW, Suite 130, Washington, DC, 20007, USA, yl67@georgetown.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/993537160?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been significantly associated with HIV among heterosexual individuals. Yet a similar relationship has not been so clearly described among men who have sex with men (MSM). The aim of this study was to investigate the association of IPV with HIV seroprevalence among MSM. Participants consisted of 7,844 MSM clients who visited the Whitman Walker Clinic in Washington DC from 2000 through 2007, the majority of whom were Caucasian with a median age of 30. The univariate analysis showed that self-reported IPV was significantly associated with HIV (OR: 1.67, CI: 1.14-2.45) among the sampled MSM clients. However, when adjusting for sexually transmitted infection (STI) status and self-reported risk behaviors including recreational drug use, condom use, number of male sex partners, and having sex with a positive HIV partner, the association of IPV with HIV was not statistically significant. Results indicated that the strong independent association of recreational drug use with HIV seroprevalence decreased the association of IPV with HIV significantly (with recreational drug use, OR: 1.36, CI: 0.93-2.00 vs. without recreational drug use, OR: 1.51, CI: 1.03-2.22).

Dating Violence and Sexual Assault Prevention With African American Middle Schoolers: Does Group Gender Composition Impact Dating Violence Attitudes?

Author: Black, Beverly M1; Weisz, Arlene N; Jayasundara, Dheeshana S1 School of Social Work, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, Texas, USA beverlyblack@uta.edu

Abstract: A dating violence and sexual assault prevention program was presented to 396, predominately African American, middle schoolers in two inner city schools in the United States. In one school the program was offered with a same-gender group composition; in the other school, the same program was offered with mixed-gender group composition. A quasi-experimental design was used to assess how gender composition in programming influenced youths' attitudes about dating violence. Study findings suggest that boys benefit most from participation in a same-gender program and girls benefit most from a mixed-gender program. Implications for prevention programming are discussed.

Item response theory analysis of intimate-partner violence in a community sample

Author: Jose, Anita1; Olino, Thomas M; O'Leary, K Daniel1 University Behavioral Associates, Montefiore Medical Center ajose@montefiore.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023027016?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2; Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, & Sugarman, 1996) is a widely used measure of physical, psychological, and sexual aggression as well as injury and negotiation between partners. In this study, we analyzed male-to-female and female-to-male physical aggression using data from 453 community couples. We used item-response theory (IRT) to assess the range and precision of physical aggression severity in the past year, as evaluated by the CTS2. Our analyses support a single dimension of physical aggression with quantitative, rather than qualitative, differentiation between minor and severe physical aggression items. Surprisingly, test information curves revealed that male perpetration and victimization items provided as much or more information as their counterpart female victimization and perpetration items over the same range of aggression severity. Finally, the data suggests that CTS2 items best assessed moderate-to-severe levels of physical aggression in the previous 12 months. However, virtually no information was assessed by male or female reports of perpetration or victimization items below or around the mean of aggression (i.e., theta = 0).

Abstract: We examined correlates of intimate partner violence (IPV) in a military Veteran sample (N = 129) using Finkel's (2007) framework for understanding the interactions between impelling and disinhibiting risk factors. Correlates investigated included head contact events (HCEs), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and antisocial features. Results indicated that antisocial features were significantly associated with IPV at the bivariate level. PTSD symptoms also were associated with IPV, but this association was marginally significant. Tests of moderation provided support for the expectation that HCEs would potentiate associations between antisocial features and IPV. HCEs also moderated the association between PTSD symptoms and IPV. However, contrary to expectations, the opposite pattern emerged such that PTSD symptoms were associated with a higher rate of IPV for those without a history of HCEs. Study findings have potentially important implications for furthering our understanding of the complex etiology of IPV in this population. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

The Impact of Child Abuse History, PTSD Symptoms, and Anger Arousal on Dating Violence Perpetration Among College Women

Author: Kendra, Rachel1; Bell, Kathryn M; Guimond, Jennifer M1 Department of Psychology, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, USA, kbell626@capital.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1009614736?accountid=14925

Abstract: Preliminary research suggests that child abuse is indirectly associated with female-perpetrated intimate partner violence via posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and anger. To date, however, no known studies have investigated these relationships for physical and psychological dating violence within a female college sample. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of child abuse history, PTSD symptoms, and anger arousal on female-perpetrated physical and psychological dating violence. Female undergraduates (N=496) completed measures of child abuse, PTSD symptoms, anger arousal, and dating violence perpetration as part of a larger trauma and violence study. Results indicated that child abuse directly predicted female-perpetrated physical and psychological dating violence and indirectly impacted female-perpetrated physical and psychological dating violence via PTSD symptoms and anger arousal. The direct relationships between PTSD symptoms and female-perpetrated physical and psychological dating violence were nonsignificant after controlling for the effect of anger arousal.

Single Types of Family Violence Victimization and Externalizing Behaviors Among Children and Adolescents

Author: Renner, Lynette M11 School of Social Work, University of Iowa, 308 North Hall, Iowa City, IA, 52242, USA lynette-renner@uiowa.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283644263?accountid=14925

Abstract: Prior research has provided substantial evidence that child maltreatment and exposure to physical intimate partner violence (IPV) are associated with increased externalizing behavior problems among children and adolescents. However, little is known about the effects of exposure to psychological IPV and exposure to the physical abuse of a sibling. Using a total sample (N=2,572) and subsample (n=441) of children ages 3-18 years old, the purpose of this study was to assess whether cumulative types of family violence lead to higher mean externalizing behavior scores and to examine the effects of single types of indirect and direct family violence on children's mean externalizing behavior scores. Results confirmed that children who experienced any type of family violence victimization had higher mean externalizing behavior scores compared to children with no history of family violence; however, few differences in externalizing behavior scores were found as the number of family violence types increased. Children who experienced indirect types of family violence (e.g., exposure to the physical abuse of a sibling) had higher externalizing behavior scores than children who experienced direct maltreatment (e.g., child physical abuse). Findings from this study suggest that researchers and service providers should adopt a broader conceptualization of family violence victimization and increase the amount of services provided to children who are indirectly victimized.

The Intergenerational Transmission of Intimate Partner Violence: Differentiating Correlates in a Random Community Sample

Author: Franklin, Cortney A1; Kercher, Glen A1 College of Criminal Justice, Sam Houston State University, P.O. Box 2296, Huntsville, TX, 77341-2296, USA, cfranklin@shsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1009584964?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study used a random sample of 502 men and women to investigate the intergenerational transmission of violence and assess the impact of family-of-origin violence on later adult intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration and victimization while controlling for a host of theoretically-relevant factors and demographic characteristics. Six multivariate logistic regression analyses were modeled to identify differential correlates depending upon type of violence perpetration and victimization. Findings indicated a significant relationship between family-of-origin violence and psychological perpetration and victimization. The acceptance of violence in relationships significantly correlated with physical violence perpetration. Finally, being married, older, and employed protected against several forms of interpersonal violence. Policy implications are discussed.

Intimate Partner Violence among Asian Americans: Risk Factor Differences across Ethnic Subgroups

Author: Cho, Hyunkag11 School of Social Work, Michigan State University, 254 Baker Hall, East Lansing, MI, 48824, USA, Chohyu12@msu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1009629140?accountid=14925

Abstract: A limited number of studies have been conducted on intimate partner violence (IPV) among Asian Americans. This study aims to fill this gap by examining risk factors for IPV and ethnic differences within Asian American subgroups. Logistic regression analyses were conducted, using data from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS). This study found that while prevalence rates of IPV varied across ethnic groups, the differences disappeared when controlling for demographic, interpersonal, and sociocultural variables. The study findings also showed that risk for IPV was higher for US-born Asian Americans, and that perceived discrimination increased the risk.

The Buffering Effect of Social Support between Domestic Violence and Self-Esteem in Pregnant Women in Tehran, Iran

Author: Nasseh Lotf Abadi, Mozhdeh1; Ghazinour, Mehdi; Nojomi, Marzieh; Richter, Jorg1 Department of Social Work, Umea University, Umea, Sweden, jrichterj@web.de

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1009588160?accountid=14925

Abstract: The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of domestic violence (DV) in pregnant women and to explore relationships of self-esteem and social support (SS) relating to DV. Six hundred young mothers were investigated. 28.2 % reported that they experienced some type of DV during pregnancy. The occurrence of physical abuse was not related to self-esteem or SS. When verbal violence was reported, satisfaction with SS was lower and self-esteem was lower by trend. Self-esteem was substantially lower when sexual violence was indicated. The number of people available for support did not provide a substantial buffering effect, but the perceived quality of SS did. Higher education in the mother and husband, and women's employment represented protective conditions against the occurrence of DV.

School-Based Group Interventions for Children Exposed to Domestic Violence

Author: Thompson, E Heather1; Trice-Black, Shannon1 Counseling Department, Western Carolina University, Candler, NC, 28715-8945, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283642589?accountid=14925

Abstract: Children exposed to the trauma of domestic violence tend to experience difficulties with internalized and externalized behavior problems, social skills deficits, and academic functioning. Mental health practitioners in the school setting, including school counselors, school psychologists, and school social workers, can address developmental concerns that impede development through group counseling interventions that include both structured activities and play therapy. The school environment offers an ideal setting in which to work with child survivors of trauma, as all students have accessibility to school mental health resources. This article outlines the primary objectives and corresponding procedures for a developmentally- appropriate group interventions for elementary-aged children who have been exposed to the trauma of domestic violence. Adapted from the source document.

The Role of Gender in Officially Reported Intimate Partner Abuse

Author: Melton, Heather C1; Sillito, Carrie Lefeve1 University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010679978?accountid=14925

Abstract: The role of gender in intimate partner abuse (IPA) perpetration and victimization has been debated for the last several decades. Two perspectives have emerged regarding this debate. Researchers from the family violence perspective argue that men and women are violent at near equal rates and call for a reframing of the issue from one of woman battering to one of family violence. In contrast, feminist researchers maintain that men make up the majority of perpetrators and women the majority of victims in cases of intimate partner abuse. While some have put forth arguments explaining these differences, this debate is far from over. Using official reported cases of IPA, this study examines 815 IPA cases of which 13% were female perpetrated in an attempt to clarify gender differences and similarities among male and female offenders beyond prevalence rates. Special attention is paid to contextual differences and similarities and implications this research has for future research and policy.

Service Utilization, Perceived Changes of Self, and Life Satisfaction Among Women Who Experienced Intimate Partner Abuse: The Mediation Effect of Empowerment

Author: Song, Li-yu11 National Cheng Chi University, Taiwan, Republic of China

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010671773?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study explored the growth experiences of women abused by their intimate partner, specifically focusing on the associations between social services and empowerment, perceived changes of self, and life satisfaction. The potential effects of demographic variables, social support, coping, and experience of partner abuse were also explored. A survey study was conducted through the collaboration of social workers in the Centers of Prevention and Intervention for Domestic Violence and private sectors in Taiwan. Through contact by their social workers, 191 participants completed the questionnaires. The results revealed that the participants had growth mainly in their psychological and interpersonal domains. The independent variables in the regression model explained 45.3% (adjusted) variance in perceived changes of self. In addition to empowerment and negative impact of violence, intensity of contact and professional relationship were two important service variables that directly and significantly correlated with perceived changes of self. A significant amount of variance (adjusted R2 = .556) in life satisfaction could be explained by the independent variables. Social support and empowerment directly correlated with life satisfaction. The findings also supported the mediation effect of empowerment. Seven variables (e.g., social support, coping method, and professional relationship) indirectly associated with perceived changes of self and life satisfaction through empowerment.

An Evaluation of Intimate Partner Violence Intervention With Incarcerated Offenders

Author: Connors, Angela D1; Mills, Jeremy F; Gray, Andrew L1 Correctional Service Canada, Bath, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010672801?accountid=14925

Abstract: The following study is an evaluation of the Moderate Intensity Family Violence Prevention Program (MIFVPP). The sample consisted of 298 male federal offenders who participated in the MIFVPP while incarcerated or on release within the community. Participants were assessed pre-, mid-, and postprogram using an assessment battery consisting of self-report questionnaires and facilitator-rated evaluation scales. Results of the study found uniform and significant (p < .001) improvement for pre and post program change in the self-report questionnaires and in the facilitator ratings. A positive improvement in motivation, whether assessed by the participant or facilitator, was associated with improvement in program outcomes and significant within, between, and interaction effects were found when participant program performance over time was compared among grouped postprogram ratings of motivation. The implication for the efficacy of addressing offender motivation to change in intimate partner violence (IPV) interventions is discussed.

Is Parent Abuse a Form of Domestic Violence

Author: Wilcox, Paula11 School of Applied Social Science, University of Brighton P.S.Wilcox@brighton.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023030796?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is a lack of research on parent abuse in the UK and a lack of research on the overlap between domestic violence and parent abuse internationally. This article explores why this is the case. Findings suggest that conceptual conflicts in defining both concepts, in framing children's safety as subsumed under mothers' safety and the desire to challenge deterministic 'cycle of violence' models may unwittingly have contributed to the failure to address parent abuse in the domestic violence field. The author argues that only by integrating parent abuse into the domestic violence framework will this issue be appropriately addressed. Adapted from the source document.

Gender-based violence and socioeconomic inequalities: Does living in more deprived neighbourhoods increase women's risk of intimate partner violence

Author: Kiss, Ligia1; Schraiber, Lilia Blima; Heise, Lori; Zimmerman, Cathy; Gouveia, Nelson; Watts, Charlotte1 Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 36 Gordon Square, London WC1H 0PD, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1081869780?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study investigates the influence of neighbourhood socioeconomic conditions on women's likelihood of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Data from 940 women who were interviewed as part of the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women, and census data for Sao Paulo City, were analyzed using multilevel regression techniques. A neighbourhood socioeconomic-level scale was created, and proxies for the socioeconomic positions of the couple were included. Other individual level variables included factors related to partner's behaviour and women's experiences and attitudes. Women's risk of IPV did not vary across neighbourhoods in Sao Paulo nor was it influenced by her individual socioeconomic characteristics. However, women in the middle range of the socioeconomic scale were significantly more likely to report having experienced violence by a partner. Partner behaviours such as excessive alcohol use, controlling behaviour and multiple sexual partnerships were important predictors of IPV. A women's likelihood of IPV also increased if either her mother had experienced IPV or if she used alcohol excessively. These findings suggest that although the characteristics of people living in deprived neighbourhoods may influence the probability that a woman will experience IPV, higher-order contextual dynamics do not seem to affect this risk. While poverty reduction will improve the lives of individuals in many ways, strategies to reduce IPV should prioritize shifting norms that reinforce certain negative male behaviours.

A Spirit Unbroken: The Black Church's Evolving Response to Domestic Violence

Author: Bent-Goodley, Tricia1; St Vil, Noelle; Hubbert, Paulette1 LICSW, Professor, Howard University, Howard University School of Social Work, 601 Howard Place, NW, Washington, DC 20059, Phone: (202) 806-4729 tbent-goodley@howard.edu

Abstract: The Black church continues to be a pillar of strength to Black families and communities. However, the role of the Black church in responding to domestic violence has been inconsistent and, at times, limited. This manuscript examines the unique and important role of the Black church in addressing and alleviating domestic violence in Black families and communities, and it identifies the ways in which the Black church has responded to domestic violence at the practice and policy levels. Ways that the Black church can provide greater leadership to eradicate domestic violence include enhancing training for clergy so that they can adequately address domestic violence, creating a sustained and collective faith-based effort to respond to domestic violence, strengthening domestic violence ministries and their role in the church, continuing to use sermons and biblical interpretations that encourage survivors to become empowered and seek help, increasing public education efforts through the Black church, and partnering with social work professionals and others to address and support their work in this area. Adapted from the source document.

The Catholic Church as a Support for Immigrant Mexican Women Living with Domestic Violence

Author: Marrs Fuchsel, Catherine L11 Assistant Professor, St. Catherine University and the University of St. Thomas School of Social Work, 2004 Randolph Ave. F-15, St. Paul, MN, 55105. Phone: (651) 690-6146 clmarrsfuchsel@stkate.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1081862083?accountid=14925

Abstract: In 2007, a qualitative exploratory study of nine in-depth interviews was conducted, using the original method of Grounded Theory to (a) examine the meaning of marriage and domestic violence among immigrant Mexican women residing in a large metropolitan southwestern city and (b) develop a domestic violence prevention model from findings. One of the categories that emerged in the process of developing a theoretical model was reaching out for help and women's experiences with types of support systems. Immigrant Mexican women use the Catholic Church as a type of informal support. The findings have implications for clergy (i.e., religious priests, deacons), as well as pastoral staff (i.e., persons working in parishes other than clergy), members regarding how they respond to incidences of domestic violence, particularly among immigrant Mexican women. In addition, social workers working with Mexican families may have a better understanding of how this support system offers services. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence, Contested Custody, And The Courts: A Review Of Findings From Five Studies With Accompanying Documentary

Author: Araji, Sharon K11 15665 W. 63rd Ave. Golden, CO 80403 sharon.araji@ucdenver.edu

Abstract: In keeping with the 2011 PSA meeting's theme, "Sociologists as Claims Makers: Turning Theory Into Action," the presidential address reported research findings (scientific sociology) that were accompanied by a documentary that represented the research results (applied sociology). Guided by a social constructionist perspective, findings from five studies were organized into seven themes to demonstrate the problems domestic violence victims, or protective parents, encounter when their abusers entangle them in contested custody battles. The documentary shown in the presidential address can be viewed in this article by connecting to a link provided. It is noted that the focus of the research and documentary remain at the social issue level-a phenomenon that exists in society, but has not yet been defined as a social problem. It is argued that the problems identified in the research are affecting many thousands of domestic violence victims and their children, yet the issue has received minimal attention in the discipline of sociology. Adapted from the source document.

Predictors of Domestic Violence Prosecution in a State Court

Author: Bechtel, Kristin A1; Alarid, Leanne F; Holsinger, Alexander; Holsinger, Kristi1 Crime and Justice Institute, Community Resources for Justice, 355 Boylston, Boston, MA 02116 kbechtel@crjustice.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716025?accountid=14925

Abstract: Successful prosecution of state-level domestic violence cases typically requires participation from the victim. However, given the unique factors associated with these cases, the assistance of a victim advocate may be beneficial in maintaining victim cooperation. This research examines 353 cases to determine if victim cooperation and case disposition could be predicted by victim advocacy, victim injuries, defendant's use of a weapon, and the presence of witnesses. Findings from logistic regression analysis suggest that victim assistance was significantly related to both victim cooperation and case disposition. Further, victim cooperation and the presence of witnesses significantly increased the likelihood of a conviction. Adapted from the source document.

Use of Mental Health Services Among Asian and Latino Victims of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Cho, Hyunkag11 Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364705464?accountid=14925

Abstract: Asian and Latino Americans are two of the fastest growing populations in the United States, but have been underrepresented in literature on intimate partner violence (IPV), especially in relation to mental health care. This study used the National Latino and Asian American Study to examine differences in use of mental health services between Asian and Latino victims of IPV. The results show that Asian victims used mental health services less than Latinos, controlling for education, English proficiency, family values, the type of IPV, and perceived mental health status, and that help seeking of those victims was affected by various individual and social factors.

Intimate Partner Violence and Condom Use Among Women: Does the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model Explain Sexual Risk Behavior?

Author: Mittal, Mona1; Senn, Theresa E; Carey, Michael P1 Department of Community and Preventive Medicine, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA, mpcarey@syr.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1017785108?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) undermines women's ability to enact safer sex and increases their vulnerability to HIV and other STDs. To better understand the relationship between IPV and sexual risk behavior, we investigated whether the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model differentially predicted risk behavior among women who had and had not recently experienced IPV. Data from 717 women who were recruited from a public health clinic showed that 18% reported IPV by a sexual partner in the past 3 months, 28% in the past year, and 57% lifetime. Women who experienced IPV in the last 3 months reported more episodes of unprotected sex and more episodes of unprotected sex with a steady partner in the past 3 months. Multi-group path analyses provided mixed evidence regarding the associations hypothesized by the IMB model; the strength of these associations varied as a function of IPV history. Thus, although information did not predict risk behavior for either group, motivation was associated with condom use only for women with no history of IPV. Behavioral skills were associated with more condom use for both groups. Overall, the IMB model is useful for predicting sexual risk behavior; however, for women with partner violence histories a broader model that includes other contextual factors may be needed. These findings can help to inform the development of more effective sexual risk reduction interventions.

Investigating Partner Abuse Among HIV-Positive Men Who have Sex with Men

Author: Pantalone, David W1; Schneider, Karen L; Valentine, Sarah E; Simoni, Jane M1 Department of Psychology, Suffolk University, 41 Temple Street, Boston, MA, 02114, USA, dpantalone@suffolk.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1017789920?accountid=14925

Abstract: High rates of partner abuse (PA) of all types-physical, sexual, and psychological-have been identified in studies of HIV-positive individuals. We examined both the prevalence and correlates of same-sex PA in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Participants recruited from public outpatient HIV clinics (N = 168) completed CASI surveys about PA and current physical and mental health. Electronic medical record data were obtained for HIV biomarkers. Results indicate high rates of past year PA (physical, 19%; sexual, 17%; psychological, 51%; any, 54%), with rates comparable to, or higher than, those reported in recent studies of HIV-positive women and older studies of HIV-positive MSM. Overall, participants endorsing past year PA reported poorer mental but not physical health. Participants who endorsed past year physical PA, specifically, reported the largest number of mental health problems. HIV care providers should routinely assess PA, especially physical PA, in all MSM patients.

Engaging with children's and parents' perspectives on domestic violence

Author: Stanley, Nicky1; Miller, Pam; Foster, Helen Richardson1 School of Social Work, University of Central Lancashire, Preston

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1125235243?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper reports research undertaken in two sites in England which captured the views of parents and young people who had experienced domestic violence. Survivors, perpetrators and young people described feelings of guilt and shame that acted as barriers to the disclosure of domestic violence. They identified a range of effects on children, which continued beyond separation. All three groups of participants valued professionals who listened to them and validated their accounts. Professionals who appeared ineffective in the face of domestic violence could reinforce children's and victims' own sense of powerlessness. Mothers wanted support with managing the effects of separation and assistance with contact arrangements. The research identifies the need for practitioners to engage with the emotional content of disclosure of domestic violence and to undertake this work in separate sessions with parents and with children so that differing accounts can be heard safely. Interventions that enable parents to engage with children's experiences of domestic violence appear valuable. Rather than taking separation as the end-point of intervention, social work needs to take account of the dynamics of separation and contact in parents' relationships and consider how they interact with violence and abuse to impact on children and young people.

Participation for children exposed to domestic violence? Social workers' approaches and children's strategies

Author: Eriksson, Maria

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541996151?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores social workers' approaches to children exposed to domestic violence and children's strategies in encounters with these professionals in the context of family law proceedings. Investigator approaches as well as child strategies are reconstructed from children's narratives. Furthermore, possible links between the social worker's approach described by a particular child, and the child's own strategies are outlined. Participation can offer children validation of their experiences and support their recovery after exposure to violence. However, it is suggested that it seems to be a challenging task for social workers to both validate children's experiences of violence and simultaneously offer them participation in the investigation process. Adapted from the source document.

Communication Skills, Social Support, and Burnout among Advocates in a Domestic Violence Agency

Author: Babin, Elizabeth A; Palazzolo, Kellie E; Rivera, Kendra Dyanne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322718865?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence affects millions of lives annually. Domestic violence advocates work to alleviate this problem; yet the nature of the work leaves them vulnerable to negative outcomes such as burnout. This study examined the relationships between communication anxiety, communication competence, perceived social support, and feelings of burnout among domestic violence advocates. Results from a survey of 69 individuals recruited from a US domestic violence agency show the combination of communication anxiety, communication competence, perceived emotional support, and perceived informational support accounted for approximately 13% of the variance in advocates' emotional exhaustion and 21% of the variance in advocates' experiences of reduced personal accomplishment. Responses also differ with the advocate's position in the agency. The following recommendations are offered: develop scenario-based communication skills training programs to reduce communication anxiety and increase communication competence, hold regular debriefing meetings to help advocates process their experiences and to receive peer support, and develop formalized mentoring programs that can provide social support for new workers. Adapted from the source document.

Wife Abuse in Tamil Nadu

Author: Chokkanathan, Srinivasan11 Department of Social Work, National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, Singapore, srinivasan.chokkanathan@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1015524605?accountid=14925

Abstract: Wife abuse is a major public health and human rights problem. Using an ecological framework, data from National Family Health Survey (NFHS 2005-2006) of 3446 women were analyzed to determine the factors associated with wife abuse in urban and rural Tamil Nadu, India. The prevalence rate of wife abuse in the year prior to the interview was 25.8% and was similar across urban and rural areas. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that in urban and rural Tamil Nadu, the micro level variables explained the highest percentage of variance in wife abuse followed by the ontogenetic, the exo system, and the macro system variables. Some of the variables that were significantly associated with wife abuse in Tamil Nadu were witnessing parental violence, drinking habit in husbands, emotional abuse, patriarchal ideology, and positive attitudes towards abuse. Implications of the results are discussed within the socio-cultural milieu of the respondents.

Patterns of Intimate Partner Violence in Mothers At-Risk for Child Maltreatment

Author: Bair-Merritt, Megan H1; Ghazarian, Sharon R; Burrell, Lori; Duggan, Anne1 Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283640751?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using three interviews spanning 3 years, we identified intimate partner violence (IPV) classes and determined how class membership changed over time amongst a sample of 217 mothers at-risk for child maltreatment that were enrolled in an early childhood home visitation evaluation study. Data on perpetration/victimization, IPV type (verbal, physical, and sexual abuse and injury) and severity were used to conduct latent class analyses at each time point. Latent transition analyses established the proportion of mothers who changed classes over time. A three-class solution (minimal, moderate, and high IPV) was indicated at each time point. All classes included mutual IPV. Partners used minor verbal abuse in the minimal class, minor and severe verbal abuse and minor physical abuse in the moderate class, and all IPV categories in the high class. At each transition, 40% or more women moved from minimal to moderate or high IPV. This movement emphasizes the need to screen women frequently and develop interventions recognizing the dynamic nature of IPV. Adapted from the source document.

TREAD: A Promising Change-Target for Partner Abuse Prevention with Adolescents

Author: Murphy, Kylie A1; Smith, David I; Xenos, Sophia1 Discipline of Psychology, School of Health Sciences, RMIT University, P.O. Box 71, 3083, Bundoora, VIC, Australia

Abstract: There is consensus in the partner abuse prevention education literature that a skills-focus is needed. However, appropriate instruments for evaluating the effectiveness of skills-focused programs do not exist. Against this background, and based on the dyadic slippery slope model of partner abuse, the Tendency to Resist or End Abusive Dynamics (TREAD) scale was developed. TREAD is defined as one's tendency to respond assertively or protectively in situations involving warning-sign (potentially hurtful or controlling) behaviors by a partner. The scale's development drew on the input of three Australian samples: mixed-gender adolescent focus groups, 426 young female respondents to an online survey, and 152 adolescent girls participating in a school-based program trial. When tested with the 152 adolescent girls, the TREAD scale had acceptable internal consistency and high inter-rater reliability. Principal components analysis identified three interrelated TREAD subscales (i.e., Conflict-Retaliation TREAD, Denigration TREAD, and Dominance-Possessiveness TREAD) all of which were negatively associated with frequency of exposure to warning-sign behaviors. This paper charts the preliminary development of the TREAD scale, presenting evidence supporting its validity as a change-target for partner abuse prevention education with adolescent girls and, potentially, boys. Adapted from the source document.

Service Providers' Reactions to Intimate Partner Violence as a Function of Victim Sexual Orientation and Type of Abuse

Author: Basow, Susan A1; Thompson, Janelle1 Lafayette College, Easton, PA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010675514?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this online vignette study, a national sample of domestic violence shelter service providers (N = 282) completed a 10-item questionnaire about a woman experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). Scenarios varied in terms of couple sexual orientation (heterosexual or lesbian) and type of abuse (physical or nonphysical). Results indicate that although participants did not overtly discriminate against a woman in a lesbian relationship, they were less likely to perceive her as a victim, and their acceptance of a lesbian as a client was more dependent on their comfort with her than was the case for a woman in a heterosexual relationship. Type of abuse, as expected, had a main effect on many questions, with physical abuse taken more seriously than nonphysical abuse. Scores on the Attitudes Toward Lesbians subscale (Herek) were unrelated to responses. Implications for service providers are discussed.

What Would They Do? Latino Church Leaders and Domestic Violence

Author: Behnke, Andrew O1; Ames, Natalie; Hancock, Tina U1 North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010671857?accountid=14925

Abstract: Understanding what Latino church leaders believe about domestic violence, and what they do when they confront it, is a key step in developing programs to help them engage in domestic violence prevention and intervention activities in their congregations. This article presents the findings from an exploratory study of 28 Latino church leaders. The study surveyed respondents' beliefs about domestic violence and asked for their reactions to three domestic violence vignettes they might encounter. We found that study participants were willing to respond to cases of domestic violence in what we would define as constructive ways. However, some responses suggested potentially unsafe and ill-advised reactions to the vignettes. We discuss our study's implications for practice and suggest future directions for additional research.

Domestic Violence During Pregnancy in an Eastern City of Turkey: A Field Study

Author: Arslantas, Huelya1; Adana, Filiz; Ergin, Filiz; Gey, Neriman; Bicer, Nejla; Kiransal, Niluefer1 Adnan Menderes University, Aydin-Turkey

Abstract: Violence is an increasing and important community health problem that can be seen in any area of human life. Limited studies were found about domestic violence among pregnant women and its relation with social status of women. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and types of domestic violence during pregnancy, factors affecting it, women's thoughts about violence, and relation between social status of women and domestic violence. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 253 pregnant women, using cluster and simple random sampling methods. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis methods were used to analyze the data. Women who indicated that they have been exposed to violence at some point of their lives were 24.1% and who indicated that violence continued while they were pregnant were 11.1%. Physical violence was the most common type of violence reported (18.2%). It was found that women who had primary school or lower level of education and who made unwanted marriage suffered from more violence during pregnancy. It can be said that violence against pregnant women is still a social problem. In societies where gender roles are dominant, decision makers have to take necessary steps such as supporting education of girls to improve social status of women, increasing awareness among women in regard to personal rights and legal regulations which will contribute to the solution of the issue.

Associations Between Intimate Partner Violence and Emotional Distress Among Pregnant Women in Durban, South Africa

Author: Groves, Allison K1; Kagee, Ashraf; Maman, Suzanne; Moodley, Dhayendre; Rouse, Petrica1 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010671877?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy has been associated with multiple negative health outcomes including emotional distress during pregnancy. However, little is known about IPV during pregnancy and its association with emotional distress among South African women. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of both emotional distress and IPV during pregnancy, to identify whether different exposures of violence were associated with emotional distress and to assess whether social support attenuated the relationship between IPV and emotional distress. Pregnant women enrolled in the South Africa HIV Antenatal and Posttest Support Study (SAHAPS) who completed the baseline survey were included in this cross sectional analysis. We used logistic regression models to explore bivariate and multivariate relationships between the proposed covariates and emotional distress. Nearly a quarter of women experienced some type of IPV during the current pregnancy, with psychological violence being the most prevalent. The odds of emotional distress was 1.41 times (95% CI: [1.26, 1.57]) higher for each additional episode of psychological violence and 2.01 times (95% CI: [1.16, 3.77]) higher for each additional episode of sexual violence during pregnancy, adjusting for other covariates. Physical violence was only marginally associated with increased odds of emotional distress. Finally, social support was marginally significant as a main effect but did not attenuate the relationship between IPV and emotional distress. The high prevalence of IPV among South African women and its association with emotional distress during pregnancy suggest that interventions that reduce violence during or prior to pregnancy are needed.

Poor Parenting and Antisocial Behavior Among Homeless Young Adults: Links to Dating Violence Perpetration and Victimization

Author: Tyler, Kimberly A1; Melander, Lisa A1 University of Nebraska-Lincoln, NE, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010671326?accountid=14925

Abstract: Though research has examined risk factors associated with street victimization among homeless young people, little is known about dating violence experiences among this group. Given homeless youths' elevated rates of child maltreatment, it is likely that they are at high risk for dating violence. As such, the current study examined the association between child maltreatment and parental warmth with dating violence perpetration and victimization through substance use and delinquency among a sample of 172 homeless males and females. Results from path analysis revealed that physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect were all significant correlates of both substance use and delinquency, whereas lack of parental warmth was only associated with substance use. Neglect and substance use had direct effects on dating violence and substance use and was found to mediate the relationship between physical abuse and dating violence. Finally, females, older youth, and non-Whites had significantly higher levels of dating violence compared with their counterparts.

Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration by Court-Ordered Men: Distinctions Among Subtypes of Physical Violence, Sexual Violence, Psychological Abuse, and Stalking

Author: Hall, Jeffrey E1; Walters, Mikel L; Basile, Kathleen C1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010671550?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study continues previous work documenting the structure of violence perpetrated by males against their female intimate partners. It assesses the construct validity of a measurement model depicting associations among eight subtypes of perpetration: moderate physical violence, severe physical violence, forced or coerced sexual violence, sexual violence where consent was not possible, emotional/verbal psychological abuse, dominance/isolation psychological abuse, interactional contacts/surveillance related stalking, and stalking involving mediated contacts. Data were obtained from a sample of 340 men arrested for physical assault of a female spouse or partner, and court ordered into batterer intervention programs. Men were surveyed before starting the intervention. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) supported the validity of model as evidenced by good model to data fit and satisfaction of requirements for fit statistics. In addition, the eight factor solution was characterized by a slightly better model to data fit than a four factor higher order solution described in the author's previous work. Latent variable correlations across the broader categories of intimate partner violence (IPV) revealed that the violence subtypes were mostly moderately positively correlated and ranged from .381 (emotional/verbal psychological abuse with interactional contacts/surveillance related stalking) to .795 (dominance/isolation psychological with abuse with forced sex). Future studies should determine whether there are distinct risk factors and health outcomes associated with each of the eight IPV perpetration subtypes and identify possible patterns of co-occurrence.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence of physical and psychological dating violence victimization and perpetration reported by inner-city African American and Hispanic adolescent girls as well as associated risky sexual behaviors among this population. Participants in this study were 10th- and 11th-grade female students from seven inner-city Chicago public high schools. Participants were administered with the Safe Dates measures of physical violence victimization, physical violence perpetration, psychological abuse victimization, and psychological perpetration. Approximately half of the sample reported some psychological dating violence victimization and perpetration, and approximately one third reported some physical victimization and perpetration. Hispanic adolescents were significantly more likely to report psychological victimization, whereas African American adolescents were significantly more likely to report physical dating violence perpetration. Victimization was found to predict perpetration in this population, and adolescents who acknowledged being both victims and perpetrators of dating violence were more likely to report having had vaginal sex and a higher number of past-year sexual partners. Inner-city African American and Hispanic adolescent girls may be particularly vulnerable to dating violence victimization and perpetration, which may be due to a number of other social factors not explored within this study. Furthermore, African American adolescent girls continue to engage in behaviors that increase their risk for negative health outcomes, predominantly STIs, highlighting the need for effective interventions with this population.

A Qualitative Examination of Ethical and Legal Considerations Regarding Dating Violence

Author: Sikes, April1; Walley, Cynthia; Hays, Danica G1 Georgia State University, Atlanta

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023031590?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite the increased attention to dating violence among adolescents and young adults, limited information is available on ethical and legal considerations specific to this population. Therefore, this qualitative study explores 21 trainees' and practitioners' conceptualization of ethical and legal issues pertaining to adolescent dating violence. Data are collected through focus groups included as part of an ethics and legal issues seminar. Six themes are identified to illustrate ethical and legal issues concerning dating violence: knowledge, client welfare, counseling interventions, informed consent and disclosure, barriers, and counselor reactions.

Judging Risk: Key Determinants in British Domestic Violence Cases

Author: Robinson, Amanda L1; Howarth, Emma1 Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023031755?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data from the largest study to date of the working practices of British victim support workers (known as Independent Domestic Violence Advisors or IDVAs) are used to provide insight into how "risk judgments" are made in cases of domestic violence. Using data from more than 2,000 victims, this study found a convergence between actuarial data and IDVAs' risk judgments when the risk score was high, but in cases with a lower risk score, IDVAs often used their professional judgment to upgrade risk. Next, we identified the specific factors underpinning IDVAs' risk judgments. Consistent with existing research, we found that IDVAs relied on a subset of available information when forming risk judgments, and characteristics of the abusive situation, such as the escalation of violence, use of weapons, stalking, and significant injuries, were particularly salient to them. Furthermore, IDVAs paid attention to victims' perceptions and when they felt very frightened or afraid of further injury then IDVAs were more likely to label them as high risk. Although we identified some encouraging overlap between the subset of factors informing risk judgments and those associated with victims' reabuse at a later date, some notable differences indicate a need for messages from research about the significance of particular risk factors to be reinforced to frontline practitioners on a regular basis.

The Relationship Between Social Support and Adolescent Dating Violence: A Comparison Across Genders

Author: Richards, Tara N1; Branch, Kathryn A1 University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023031756?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although much research has focused on the function of social support in adult intimate partner violence, little is known about the role of social support in adolescent dating violence. This study is an exploratory analysis of the independent impact of social support from friends and family on the risk of adolescent dating violence perpetration and victimization among a large sample of youth (n = 970). Approximately, 21% of the sample reported experiencing victimization in a dating relationship whereas 23% indicated perpetrating dating violence. Male youth reported significantly more involvement in dating violence as both perpetrators and victims. Negative binomial regression modeling indicated that increased levels of support from friends was associated with significantly less dating violence perpetration and victimization; however, when gendered models were explored, the protective role of social support was only maintained for female youth. Family support was not significantly related to dating violence in any model. Implications for dating violence curriculum and future research are addressed.

The Relationship Between Marijuana Use and Intimate Partner Violence in a Nationally Representative, Longitudinal Sample

Author: Reingle, Jennifer M1; Staras, Stephanie A S; Jennings, Wesley G; Branchini, Jennifer; Maldonado-Molina, Mildred M1 University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023031757?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intimate partner violence is a significant public health problem, as these behaviors have been associated with a number of negative health outcomes including illicit drug use, physical injury, chronic pain, sexually transmitted diseases, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The current study examined the association between marijuana use and intimate partner violence using a longitudinal survey of adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 26 years. Data were obtained from 9,421 adolescents in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Waves 1 through 4 (1995-2008). Marijuana use was measured in the past year at each wave and participants were categorized as "users" or "nonusers." Partner violence was constructed using six items (three pertaining to victimization and three concerning perpetration) from Wave 4 (2007-2008). Using these six items, participants were categorized as "victims only," "perpetrators only," or "victims and perpetrators." Survey multinomial regression was used to examine the relationship between marijuana use and intimate partner violence. Consistent use of marijuana during adolescence was most predictive of intimate partner violence (OR = 2.08, p < .001). Consistent marijuana use (OR = 1.85, p < .05) was related to an increased risk of intimate partner violence perpetration. Adolescent marijuana use, particularly consistent use throughout adolescence, is associated with perpetration or both perpetration of and victimization by intimate partner violence in early adulthood. These findings have implications for intimate partner violence prevention efforts, as marijuana use should be considered as a target of early intimate partner violence intervention and treatment programming.

Intimate Partner Violence and Patterns of Alcohol Abuse and Dependence Criteria Among Women: A Latent Class Analysis

Author: La Flair, Lareina N1; Bradshaw, Catherine P; Storr, Carla L; Green, Kerry M; Alvanzo, Anika A H; Crum, Rosa M1 Department of Mental Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463019238?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major public health issue, yet little is known about the association between IPV victimization and problem drinking among women. Study objectives were to (a) identify subtypes of problem drinking among women according to abuse and dependence criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV); (b) examine the association between recent IPV and the problem drinking classes; and (c) evaluate major depressive disorder (MDD) as a mediator of the IPV-alcohol relationship. Method: Data come from a cohort of 11,782 female current drinkers participating in Wave 2 (2004-2005) of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Latent class analysis was used to group participants into problem drinking classes according to 11 DSM-IV abuse and dependence criteria. The IPV measure was derived from six questions regarding abusive behaviors perpetrated by a romantic partner in the past year. Past-year MDD was assessed according to DSM-IV criteria. Latent class regression was used to test the association between drinking class and IPV. Results: Three classes of problem drinkers were identified: Severe (Class 1: 1.9%; n = 224), moderate (Class 2: 14.2%; n = 1,676), and nonsymptomatic (Class 3: 83.9%; n = 9,882). Past-year IPV was associated with severe and moderate classes (severe: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 5.70, 95% CI [3.70, 8.77]; moderate: aOR = 1.92, 95% CI [1.43, 2.57]). Past-year MDD was a possible mediator of the IPV-drinking class relationship. Conclusions: Results indicate a strong association between recent IPV and problem drinking class membership. This study offers preliminary evidence that programs aimed at preventing problem drinking among women should take IPV and MDD into consideration. Adapted from the source document.

Risky Business: An Ecological Analysis of Intimate Partner Violence Disclosure

Author: Alaggia, Ramona1; Regehr, Cheryl; Jenney, Angelique1 Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada ramona.alaggia@utoronto.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1081869934?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: A multistage, mixed-methods study using grounded theory with descriptive data was conducted to examine factors in disclosure of intimate partner violence (IPV). Method: In-depth interviews with individuals and focus groups were undertaken to collect data from 98 IPV survivors and service providers to identify influential factors. Quantitative data were also collected on adult trauma levels and child concerns from 20 women. Results: An ecological analysis revealed that IPV disclosure occurs within a complex interplay of distinct individual and environmental considerations. Specific system level factors of the ecological framework-ontogenic, micro, exo, and macro-emerged as influencing disclosure and ultimately shaped womens' disclosure processes. Conclusion: IPV disclosure remains a "risky business" with perceived negative outcomes outweighing benefits. Results reinforce that social work interventions need to occur at all levels of the human ecology in order to provide effective responses.

Mandatory Reporting in the Context of Home Visitation Programs: Intimate Partner Violence and Children's Exposure to Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Davidov, Danielle M1; Jack, Susan M; Frost, Stephanie S; Coben, Jeffrey H1 Department of Emergency Medicine, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364703983?accountid=14925

Abstract: The mandatory reporting of intimate partner violence (IPV) is a controversial issue that is receiving increased attention. A related concern is whether children's exposure to IPV constitutes child maltreatment, making it reportable to child protective services. These issues have been relatively unexplored within the context of home visitation programs. A secondary analysis of qualitative data collected from community stakeholders, clients, and home visiting nurses in the Nurse-Family Partnership program was carried out. Participants' perceptions about mandatory reporting of IPV and reporting of children's exposure to IPV are highlighted. Emergent themes and implications for research, practice, and policy are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

College Women's Experiences of Dating Violence in Casual and Exclusive Relationships

Abstract: Using a sample of female college students involved in a current dating relationship, we investigate the nature of violence in these intimate relationships to better understand the concept of violence mutuality. To do so we explore womens' experiences with violence as both perpetrators and victims and examine the prevalence, chronicity, and severity of violence experienced by young women. We also examine whether there are differences in experiences of violence for women in casual versus exclusive dating relationships. Our findings suggest that when violence is present in a dating relationship it is likely to occur within a mutually violent relationship where women are both victims and perpetrators of violence. More importantly, within these mutually violent relationships, women reported being more likely to perpetrate violence at higher rates than they experience as victims. We find no notable differences in experiences with violence among those in casual versus exclusive relationships. The methodological limitations and policy implications of our findings are discussed.

Spatial analysis of domestic violence against women from 2002 to 2005 in Joao Pessoa, Paraiba State, Brazil

Author: Tavares de Lucena, Kerle Dayana1; Medeiros Cavalcanti da Silva, Ana Tereza; Marcos de Moraes, Ronei; Cavalcanti da Silva, Cesar; Pinheiro Bezerra, Italla Maria1 Universidade Federal da Paraiba. Rua Pedro Batista da Silva 102, Joao Pessoa, PB 58040-510, Brasil

Abstract: This was a quantitative, ecological, exploratory study using spatial analysis and a geographic information system. The population consisted of all the women that had filed complaints against domestic violence in the city of Joao Pessoa, Paraiba State, Brazil, from 2002 to 2005, at the Specialized Police Precinct for Women. The aim was to investigate the spatial distribution of domestic violence in order to assist policymakers in the decision-making process. Analysis of the results allowed identifying areas of low and high incidence of domestic violence, besides comparing the risk in each neighborhood to the overall rate for the city of Joao Pessoa. Based on the Getis and Ord index, the study produced a decision on priority areas for intervening in domestic violence. The authors highlight the need for changes in care for female victims of violence and the link among institutions with permanent education in the services, including discussions on gender and violence against women.

Sociological Theories of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Lawson, Jennifer11 School of Social Welfare, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA jennlawson@berkeley.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1567048589?accountid=14925

Abstract: Sociological theories of intimate partner violence seek to explain violent behavior as a function of social structures rather than individual pathology. This review examines the major theories used by sociologists to understand intimate partner violence, categorizing them by their respective views regarding the role of gender in intimate partner violence. Family violence theories (including systems theory, ecological theory, exchange/social control theory, resource theory, and the subculture-of-violence theory) view intimate partner violence as an expression of conflict within the family that can best be understood through examination of social structures contributing to the use of violence. Feminist theory sees intimate partner violence as an expression of gender-based domination of women by men. This review also discusses some integrative theories that seek to bridge the polarized views of the traditional perspectives in relation to gender. Adapted from the source document.

A Mixed Methods Study of Participant Reaction to Domestic Violence Research in Jordan

Author: Clark, Cari Jo1; Shahrouri, Manal; Halasa, Louma; Khalaf, Inaam; Spencer, Rachael; Everson-Rose, Susan1 University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023027186?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on domestic violence against women has increased considerably over the past few decades. Most participants in such studies find the exercise worthwhile and of greater benefit than emotional cost; however, systematic examination of participant reaction to research on violence is considerably lacking, especially in the Middle East region. This study begins to fill this gap by examining women's reactions to domestic violence research in Jordan and whether a personal history of violence is associated with unfavorable experiences. This sequential exploratory mixed methods study included 17 focus group discussions (FGD) with women in Amman followed by a survey conducted in reproductive health clinics throughout the country (pilot n = 30; survey n = 517). Open coding was used to identify the theme related to participant reaction in the FGD data. This construct was further examined by the subsequent survey that included dichotomous questions inquiring whether the respondent thought the study questions were important and whether they were angry or felt resentment as a result of the survey. One open-ended question on the survey provided additional qualitative data on the theme that was combined with the FGD data. Themes identified in the qualitative data pertained to expressions of gratitude and comments on the survey's value. Findings of this study indicate that Jordanian women's responses to the research process are similar to women currently represented by the extant literature in that a vast majority of its participants felt that the study was important (95%) and it did not evoke anger or resentment (96%). Many even found the study to be useful to them personally or to society. Among those who had a negative emotional reaction, most still found the research to be important. This study's findings highlight the safety and potential benefits of ethically conducted violence research. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Dating Norms and Dating Violence Among Ninth Graders in Northeast Georgia: Reports From Student Surveys and Focus Groups

Author: Reeves, Patricia M1; Orpinas, Pamela1 University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023026483?accountid=14925

Abstract: This mixed-methods study describes the norms supporting male-to-female and female-to-male dating violence in a diverse sample of ninth graders. The quantitative study, based on student surveys (n = 624), compared norms supporting dating violence by sex, race/ethnicity, and dating status, and it examined the relation between dating violence norms and physical aggression and victimization. The qualitative study, based on 12 focus groups, explored participants' views of dating aggression. Findings revealed more support for female-to-male aggression, greater acceptance of norms supporting dating violence by non-White students, a strong association between norms and physical aggression but only in males, and a high correlation between victimization and perpetration. Participants rejected male-to-female dating aggression because of peer pressure not to hit girls, parents' beliefs that denounce dating violence, the superior physical advantage of boys over girls, and legal consequences. Results highlight the importance of culturally sensitive and gender-specific interventions. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Victims' Influence on Intimate Partner Violence Revictimization: An Empirical Test of Dynamic Victim-Related Risk Factors

Author: Kuijpers, Karlijn F1; Van der Knaap, Leontien M.; Winkel, Frans Willem1 Institute for Criminal Law and Criminology, Leiden University, Leiden, the Netherlands

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023026585?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research has reported that not only characteristics of the perpetrator but also characteristics of the victim influence risk for intimate partner violence (IPV). This would suggest that prevention of repeat abuse could benefit from a focus on both perpetrator and victim characteristics. Knowledge on factors that are within victims' sphere of influence is important because a focus on victim characteristics can help victims to take control of their situations and can thereby empower them. Dynamic victim-related factors are most relevant here as these are factors that can be changed or improved, in contrast to unchangeable static factors. Surprisingly, however, little is known about how victim-related factors affect risk for revictimization of IPV. The current study was conducted among a Dutch sample of 156 female, help-seeking IPV victims. The aim was to examine to what extent prior IPV and, in particular, dynamic victim-related factors influence risk for future IPV. In accordance with the models articulated by Foa, Cascardi, Zoellner and Feeny, we studied how the three key factors from their models-partner violence, victims' psychological difficulties, and victims' resilience-related to risk for IPV revictimization. Results provide support for several key factors (partner violence and victims' psychological difficulties) and, moreover, show which victim-related factors contribute to revictimization risk above and beyond the influence of prior violence committed by a partner against the victim (i.e., victims' prior IPV victimizations). Findings are discussed in terms of recommendations for practice and future research. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Intimate Partner Violence and Alcohol Problems in Interethnic and Intraethnic Couples

Author: Chartier, Karen G1; Caetano, Raul1 University of Texas School of Public Health, Dallas, TX, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1023026641?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite the growing number of interethnic marriages in the United States, few studies have examined intimate partner violence (IPV) in interethnic couples. This article examined past-year occurrences of IPV across interethnic and intraethnic couples and tested correlates of IPV specifically in interethnic couples. Data were from a national survey of couples 18 years of age and older from the 48 contiguous states. Interethnic couples (n = 116) included partners from different ethnic backgrounds, including Black-White, Hispanic-White, and Black-Hispanic couples. White (n = 555), Black (n = 358), and Hispanic (n = 527) intraethnic couples included partners with the same ethnicity. Data analyses were prevalence rates and logistic regressions. The analysis showed that interethnic couples were comparatively younger and had shorter relationships than intraethnic White, Black, and Hispanic couples. Male partners in interethnic couples had higher rates of binge drinking and alcohol problems compared with male partners in intraethnic couples. Past-year prevalence rates for any occurrence of IPV and acts of severe IPV were higher for interethnic couples relative to intraethnic couples. Most occurrences of IPV for interethnic couples were mutual. Factors predicting IPV among interethnic couples included marital status, couples' age, male alcohol problems, and female impulsivity. Mounting evidence points to interethnic couples as a high-risk group for IPV. Interethnic couples may be at greater risk for IPV because of their younger age, binge drinking, and alcohol problems. Future research could build on this study by examining cohort effects and regional differences in IPV for interethnic couples and the risk for IPV across interethnic couples of different ethnic compositions.

Appraisal Distortions And Intimate Partner Violence: Gender, Power, And Interaction

Author: Whiting, Jason B1; Oka, Megan; Fife, Stephen T1 Texas Tech University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037875940?accountid=14925

Abstract: In relationships characterized by control, abuse, or violence, many appraisal distortions occur including denial and minimization. However, the nature of the distortion varies depending on the individual's role in the relationship (i.e., abuser or victim). Reducing these distortions is an important component in treatment success and involves accepting responsibility for actions and attributions. This study used constructivist grounded theory methods to explore the following questions: (1) What are the types of distortions that are used by individuals who have been in violent or abusive relationships? (2) What are the gender and power differences in the appraisal distortions used? (3) What are the functions and interactions of the distortions in the relationship dynamics? Qualitative analysis of interviews with 29 individuals who had been in abusive relationships found that there were several types of distortions used by participants, but there were differences in the function of the distortion, depending on the individual's role in the abuse. These generally corresponded to power and gender, where the male as perpetrator used different distortions (or used similar distortions for different reasons) than did the female as victim. Suggestions for research as well as treatment implications for both offenders and survivors of abuse are given. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence and Emotion Socialization

Author: Katz, Lynn Fainsilber1; Rigterink, Tami1 Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Washington, USA katzlf@uw.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1221410420?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence (DV) is highly prevalent among American families, with up to 50% of married couples experiencing spousal violence at some point in their marriages (Straus & Gelles, 1990; Straus Gelles, & Steinmetz, 1980). Not only do survivors of DV exhibit signs of significant psychological disturbance subsequent to abuse, but also there is substantial evidence that children exposed to DV may experience subsequent negative developmental outcomes (Jouriles, Norwood, McDonald, & Peters, 2001). Compared to children from nonviolent homes, children exposed to DV exhibit higher levels of anxiety, depression, and externalizing problems (Jouriles, McDonald, & Skopp, 2005). and they have greater difficulties with peers (McCloskey & Stuewig, 2001).

Police intervention in domestic violence incidents where children are present: police and children's perspectives

Author: Richardson-Foster, Helen1; Stanley, Nicky; Miller, Pam; Thomson, Gill1 Department of Sociological Studies, University of Sheffield, Elmfield, Northumberland Road, Sheffield, S10 2TU, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322722489?accountid=14925

Abstract: The police represent the front line in the service response to children experiencing domestic violence. This paper examines police intervention in domestic violence incidents involving children, drawing on quantitative and qualitative data from police records and interviews with young people and police officers. The quality of police communication with children and young people emerged as key, and police officers evinced reluctance to engage with children at domestic violence incidents. Providing the police with training and information designed to improve their skills and confidence might promote communication with children in this context. Policy that conceptualised children as victims of domestic violence in policy could focus police attention on the needs of children and young people at such incidents. Adapted from the source document.

Relationship Power, Control, and Dating Violence Among Latina Girls

Author: Lopez, Vera1; Chesney-Lind, Meda; Foley, Julia1 Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364702122?accountid=14925

Abstract: We drew on the theory of gender and power and grounded theory methodology to explore how 18 Latina girls conceptualized power and control within their heterosexual dating relationships. Our findings indicate that boys/men used a number of strategies to control girls, including: regulating appearances and behaviors; cheating and threatening to cheat; and physical and sexual violence. Girls used a variety of strategies to resist these attempts to control them, including: lying, flirting, and cheating; reactive violence; breaking up; and maintaining emotional distance. Girls attempted to subvert boys' attempts to control them; however, these attempts were not always successful given the constraints of gender that adolescent females must negotiate.

Characteristics Related to Protection Order Use Among Victims of Intimate Partner Violence

Author: Durfee, Alesha1; Messing, Jill Theresa1 Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704398?accountid=14925

Abstract: One increasingly important resource for victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) is domestic violence civil protection orders (POs). Using a transdisciplinary framework, this article critically examines the use of POs by IPV victims seeking shelter services. Previous contact with police and medical professionals are the strongest predictors of having obtained a PO; education level, income, age, race, and having children in the shelter are also significant predictors of having obtained a PO. These findings are discussed in the context of previous research on help-seeking behaviors and the growing body of transdisciplinary research on Violence Against Women.

Expect Respect Support Groups: Preliminary Evaluation of a Dating Violence Prevention Program for At-Risk Youth

Author: Ball, Barbara1; Tharp, Andra Teten; Noonan, Rita K; Valle, Linda Anne; Hamburger, Merle E; Rosenbluth, Barri1 SafePlace, Austin, TX, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364701141?accountid=14925

Abstract: Expect Respect support groups, a selective prevention strategy, are designed to prevent and reduce dating violence among at-risk middle and high school students. This preliminary, uncontrolled evaluation examined changes in healthy relationship skills and emotionally and physically abusive behaviors in participants' peer and dating relationships. Self-reports (N = 144) showed significant increases in healthy relationship skills from baseline to program completion, whereas levels of victimization and perpetration remained unchanged. A subgroup of students who reported baseline levels of victimization and perpetration with means at least one standard deviation above the group mean reported significantly less victimization and perpetration at program completion.

Intimate Partner Violence Prevention Program in an Asian Immigrant Community: Integrating Theories, Data, and Community

Author: Yoshihama, Mieko1; Ramakrishnan, Aparna; Hammock, Amy C; Khaliq, Mahmooda1 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704565?accountid=14925

Abstract: To fill an existing gap in research and practice on intimate partner violence (IPV) in immigrant communities, the authors developed an IPV prevention program, called the Shanti Project, in an Asian Indian community in the Midwest. Building on the notion of shanti (harmony/peace), a cherished value and strength of the community, we created a communications campaign that combined social marketing and community-based participatory approaches. Recognizing the interactive influences of multiple levels of social ecology, campaign activities were designed to bring about changes at the individual, relationship/family, organization, and community levels. This article presents the development of this theoretically, empirically, and community-based IPV prevention program. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Shifting Policy Responses to Domestic Violence in the Netherlands and Spain (1980-2009)

Author: Roggeband, Conny11 VU University Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704570?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article seeks to understand differences in the evolution of policies to combat domestic Violence Against Women in the Netherlands and Spain. Although policy change is often viewed as incremental change toward more progressive policies, the two countries studied here reflect opposing dynamics. The Netherlands moved from being a pioneering country to one that gradually marginalized the policy issue, whereas Spain, in contrast, recently developed innovative and far-reaching policies after a long period of low to moderate state responses. The case study points to the central role of frame negotiation, left-wing governments, and strong feminist mobilization. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

" . . . There is No War Here; It is Only the Relationship That Makes Us Scared": Factors Having an Impact on Domestic Violence in Liberian Refugee Communities in South Australia

Author: Zannettino, Lana11 Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704580?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores the factors that have an impact on domestic violence in African refugee communities, with specific reference to the Liberian community in South Australia. Seventeen focus group discussions were undertaken with women participants of the Liberian Women's Gathering. The nested ecological model (Dutton, 2001; Heise, 1998) is used to conceptualize the factors having an impact on domestic violence. The findings suggest that disruption to traditional gender roles has an impact on domestic violence at the cultural, socioeconomic, familial, and individual levels and that women's experience of domestic violence must be understood in relation to the acute and prolonged stressors of war, loss, and displacement.

Married Women's Risk of STIs in Developing Countries: The Role of Intimate Partner Violence and Partner's Infection Status

Author: Kishor, Sunita11 ICF Macro, Calverton, MD, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1222921122?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data for nationally representative samples of cohabiting couples in six developing countries show that intimate partner violence (IPV) increases the risk of self-reported sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for currently married women (ORs = 1.4-2.2) in all six countries, and that the strength of this relationship is not diminished by controls for proximate determinants such as husband's self-reported STI status and men's and women's higher-risk behaviors. The robustness of the IPV-STI relationship suggests the need to acknowledge IPV as an STI risk factor for women on par with other recognized risk factors such as multiple sexual partners and unprotected sexual intercourse.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Intimate Partner Violence in a Women's Headache Center

Author: Gerber, Megan R1; Fried, Lise E; Pineles, Suzanne L; Shipherd, Jillian C; Bernstein, Carolyn A1 VA Boston Healthcare System/Women's Health, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA megan.gerber@va.gov

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347782578?accountid=14925

Abstract: Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder has been linked to women's ill health, including headaches. Intimate partner violence, which may result in posttraumatic stress disorder, is often reported by women with headaches. Prior studies of intimate partner violence and headache have estimated lifetime but not 12-month prevalence. The researchers in this study examined the relationship between headache and posttraumatic stress disorder in a novel population, and estimated 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of intimate partner violence. Methods: Patients were recruited from a women's headache center (n = 92) during 2006-07 and completed the Migraine Disability Assessment measure of headache severity. Posttraumatic stress disorder was measured using a modified Breslau scale. Twelve-month and lifetime physical intimate partner violence were measured with the Partner Violence Screen and the STaT ("slapped, threatened and throw") measure. Multivariable regression determined factors independently associated with headache severity. Results: Among all participants, 28.3% screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder; 9.8% and 36.9% of women endorsed recent and lifetime intimate partner violence. Posttraumatic stress disorder was strongly associated with headache severity (Beta = 34.12, p = 0.01). Patients reporting lifetime intimate partner violence exhibited a trend of nine additional days of disability due to headache over 90 days. Conclusions: Posttraumatic stress disorder and intimate partner violence occur among a sizable proportion of women referred for headache. The authors' findings reaffirm that clinicians treating women with headaches must be aware of the possibility of posttraumatic stress disorder and intimate partner violence in such patients. Adapted from the source document.
